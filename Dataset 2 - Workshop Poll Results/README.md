# Data Custodians and Researchers Poll Results Dataset

## Results of polls held during workshops with data custodians (25-Mar-21) and researchers and innovators (26-Mar-21).

**Background**
HDR UK hosted a series of workshops with data custodians, researchers, innovators and members of the public to stimulate discussion on the value of data use registers and understand the needs and challenges to creating a standard. 
Several polls were conducted during the workshops with data custodians and researchers. The results include responses from a total of 30 data custodians and 13 researchers that were in attendance. 

**Limitations**
Participation in these polls was on a voluntary basis and time limited to 30 seconds per question. 
The polls were run during different intervals of the workshops, as such some questions have more responses than others.
