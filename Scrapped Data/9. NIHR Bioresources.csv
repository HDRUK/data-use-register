Cardiovascular Disease","Platelets trigger blood clotting following injury, but also cause thrombosis, leading to heart attacks and strokes.  Platelets are targeted using drugs that inhibit their activation and while these prevent thrombosis in many patients, a sizeable proportion gain no benefit.  Presently a ‘one size fits all’ approach is used: patients at risk of thrombosis are given one or more standard anti-platelet medication.  Recent trials indicate that such approach is protective again secondary thrombosis in patients that have already suffered thrombosis, but does not protect patients without a history of thrombosis.  This raises the question: are we treating patients appropriately and giving medication to those most likely to respond positively? To answer this question we need to understand exactly how platelet reactivity varies and why this occurs, and the impact of this on responsiveness to anti-platelet therapies. To address this we have measured in detail the functional characteristics of 700 healthy individuals. We have developed new high-throughput assays that utilise machine learning approaches to allocate donors to one of 8 distinct phenotypic groups. Curiously, the least reactive phenotypic group also contains a large proportion of overweight patients, those with early signs on insulin resistance and elevated blood lipids. This was not expected, and would suggest that a group that is considered higher risk for cardiovascular disease may be less responsive to anti-platelet medication. In the proposed study extension we will recall participants from the highest and lowest responsive groups to (1) validate the profiling procedure, (2) to determine whether phenotype within individuals is stable, (3) test responsiveness to anti-platelet medication and (4) collect protein samples from donors’ platelets to enable detailed proteomic profiling to be performed. This will allow mechanisms of variability to be studied and biomarkers established to perform simplified clinical tests, and the development of precision-medicine approaches to combat thrombosis."

Infection","Detection and characterisation of antibodies in biological samples is a key requirement of clinical diagnostics and underpins risk assessment and clinical decision making in infectious diseases. Two fundamental properties of the antibody response to pathogens are its magnitude (antibody concentration) and its strength (affinity of antibody binding to its target protein). However, these properties are difficult to quantify directly using the currently available immunoassays for antibody detection. We have recently developed a novel immunoassay that enables measurement of antibody concentration and of affinity of binding directly in patient serum and under physiological conditions i.e. without the need for immobilisation of target proteins on artificial surfaces that can influence the measured signal. In a small pilot study, we found that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) develop antibody responses that vary widely in their binding affinity to viral proteins. We now wish to use our immunoassay to profile antibody responses in a large cohort of patients with different COVID-19 disease severity (from asymptomatic to severe disease) and in healthy individuals that undergo vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. We anticipate that this study will increase our understanding of the nature and variability of immune responses against this virus in different individuals and provide important clues to help define the adequacy of immune protection after SARS-CoV-2 infection and after vaccination."

Infection","COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease caused by a virus related to those which caused previous outbreaks of SARS and MERs. Most infected people have no or only mild symptoms, but a significant fraction suffer from severe lung and breathing symptoms which need to be treated in hospital. These patients must stay in COVID-19 specific wards to prevent them from infecting other patients. Measurements from some standard blood tests frequently performed in NHS hospitals have been shown to contain information which may be useful to distinguish between patients with COVID-19 and patients with diseases with similar symptoms. Standard tests also seem to contain information that is useful for predicting the course of the disease in COVID-19 infected patients. We have developed an algorithm that attempts to use these standard hospital tests and medical records to: 1)Determine whether a patient is infected with COVID-19 2)Predict the expected course of a COVID-19 patient's disease. These inferences will be useful to triage patients into wards on admission and to identify which patients are likely to need which treatments. We seek access to NIHR BioResource data to understand how measurements from standard hospital tests vary in healthy people and people with rare diseases. This will help us to identify useful signatures in COVID-19 infected individuals."

Genomics and Rare Diseases","Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a rare Mendelian disorder of the connective tissue which remain largely uncharacterised genetically. We have a large existing collection of cases, covering the whole spectrum of the syndrome. Using target enrichment and next-generation sequencing (NGS), we have already screened these samples for those variants know to be associated with the condition, however, the majority (>70%) remain unclassified. This project proposed that cases without a present molecular diagnosis should be further characterised by exome sequencing. The work stands to redefine the molecular genetic architecture of the condition, potentially identifying n ew susceptibility genes and thereby increasing the proportion of patients to whom a molecular genetic diagnosis can be attributed. Around 180 exomes have been sequenced from previously uncharacterised patients with EDS and the exomes have now undergone full analysis of variants in known and candidate EDS genes by the study team including Aitman, Weerakkody, Vandrovcova and Vandersteen. Some of the original data from whole genome sequencing from separate patients in the EDS cohort have already been published in the flagship BRIDGE publication. We now request permission to carry out a full burden analysis on the exome sequence data in collaboration with Professor Cordell of the University of Newcastle. The new work will be used to estimate the effects of SNPs within known and suspected EDS genes for a further publication."

Access to psychological therapies and drug treatments such as anti-depressants is increasing, but only half of people respond well to existing treatment options. For the thousands who remain unwell, these conditions may worsen over time and can lead to relationship and employment problems, a poor quality of life and even suicide. Research has shown 30-40% of the risk for both depression and anxiety is genetic and 60-70% due to environmental factors. Only by having a large, diverse group of people available for future studies will researchers be able to determine how genetic and environmental triggers interact to cause anxiety and depression and how to develop more effective treatments. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) BioResource and King’s College London are recruiting 40,000 people with depression or anxiety to join the online Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study, funded by the NIHR.

Cardiovascular Disease, Infection","With global COVID-19 cases rising and a further projected increase for the months to come therapeutic strategies to combat the disease are urgently needed. Despite the likely approval of a small number of COVID-19 vaccines, the NHS will inevitably need to cope with large numbers of COVID-19 patients over many months, as a broad rollout of national vaccine programs will take a considerable amount of time and uptake and effectiveness are unlikely to reach 100%.  Heart complications occur in up to 30% of COVID-19 critically ill patients and therefore hospitals will continue to treat these patients for which no satisfactory therapy exists. The cause of the heart damage remains poorly understood. One idea is that the inflammation following infection by SARS-CoV2 (the virus causing COVID-19) might be causing the heart damage. Our project will use the serum (fluid part of the blood) collected from COVID-19 patients to see whether this damages heart cells that we generate from stem cells in a tissue culture dish. We think that cytokines (the proteins that cause the inflammatory process) in the serum of these patients might cause heart muscle damage or interfere with their beating. These experiments will identify the specific cytokines or combination of cytokines that might be responsible for the heart injury. We can then identify drugs that can be employed to block the damaging cytokines to ultimately prevent or ameliorate heart damage. Furthermore, the results will be useful to predict which COVID-19 patients will be more likely to develop heart complication and will ultimately result in reduced disability and death from heart problems."

Combined these allow for rich phenotyping of a cohort of individuals who are recovering from COVID disease.  CPET is a well-validated test that provides an objective assessment of cardiorespiratory response to incremental exercise, which allows clinicians to determine cardiorespiratory fitness and identify reasons for physical impairment. Many patients admitted to hospital with severe acute respiratory syndrome experience significant exercise limitation in the months following hospital discharge. In these patients, CPET has been used to characterise the physiological mechanisms underlying their exercise limitation. It is hypothesised that CPET may provide similar insights into the mechanisms underlying persisting functional limitation following COVID-19 infection, provide diagnostic and prognostic indicators and potentially help guide the development support strategies for those with long-term disability and to assess the efficacy of developed interventions.

Proposed hypotheses encompass an interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Previous studies have demonstrated a higher incidence (number of new cases) and more aggressive disease course in ethnic groups. Studying changing incidence of disease in ethnic populations who have migrated from abroad offers a unique opportunity to examine dietary and environmental factors that may contribute to disease presentation. We propose a multi-centre prospective cohort study to enrol all new cases of IBD and study the contribution of ethnic diversity. The study will be designed to examine the role of diet and the gut bacteria and define variables that may predict response to therapy by integrating clinical data with stool sample collections to examine the gut microbiota (the population of gut bacteria living in our intestine). The newly diagnosed inception cohort will be followed up for specific outcomes such as adverse drug events, surgery, pregnancy, and disease complications including cancer. The study will generate a collaborative network of UK-based centres to collect data on the epidemiology and outcomes of IBD via a standardised, validated web based database.

Biologics, as they are known, are an important addition to these medications. The most widely used biologics target an immune modulator known as Tumour Necrosis Factor, or TNF, which contributes to the characteristic inflammation seen in CD and UC patients. While highly effective therapies in some individuals, the use of biologics is limited by a percentage of patients (10-40%) who do not respond at all to these therapies (primary non-response) and by loss of response (in 24-46% of patients) to treatment in the first year. Secondary loss of response is commonly due to a patient's development of antibodies against the medication, rendering it less effective over time."

Gastroenterology",".In the UK, at least 300,000 people have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). IBD leads to chronic inflammation in parts of the digestive system and it is thought to occur due to an abnormal response to harmless bacteria in the gut. This response is believed to be a consequence of a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Our group and others have used genetic association studies (GWAS) to identify over 240 regions of the genome that increase susceptibility to IBD. Some of these regions are within well-known genes that interfere with the immunological response. However, most of them have no defined mechanism of action. Understanding how these variants contribute to someone developing IBD is important for our biological understanding of disease mechanisms and the development of novel therapies. In this project we aim to investigate the mechanisms by which four genetic variants increase the risk of developing IBD. These genetic variants are likely to play a role in the production and/or response to inflammatory mediators important in IBD. We will analyse changes in the gene expression and function of immune cells comparing individuals carrying the risk variants with those carrying the non-risk variants. Our studies aim to increase our understanding of how genetic variants affect the individual’s immune function and might contribute to their increased risk for developing IBD."

Genomics and Rare Diseases","Primary immunodeficiency (PID) is characterised by recurrent and often life-threatening infections, autoimmunity and cancer, and it presents major diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Although the most severe forms present in early childhood, the majority of patients present in adulthood, typically with no apparent family history and a variable clinical phenotype of widespread immune dysregulation. Consequently, in sporadic PID genetic diagnosis is difficult and the role of genetics is not well defined. We have addressed this by performing whole genome sequencing of a large cohort of PID patients. This analysis has identified new genes contributing to PID and deepened our understanding of the key pathways determining variation in human immune  responsiveness."

Genomics and Rare Diseases","The function of the coagulation system is to ameliorate blood loss (haemorrhage) by clotting when the integrity of a blood vessel wall has been breached. The formation of a blood clot depends on a cascade of interactions between numerous proteins in the blood to generate fibrin which stabilises the primary platelet plug. The concentrations of these proteins vary considerably between individuals and it has been hypothesised that the concentration of certain coagulation factors in the blood may be a significant determinant of the risk of bleeding or haemorrhage, including the risk of major haemorrhage during surgery and after trauma. Recent advances in molecular measuring technology have allowed the systematic measurement of concentrations of selected proteins in blood plasma, in thousand of participants in epidemiological cohorts. Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of alleles associated with concretions of proteins, many of which are coagulation factors (e.g. Sun et al 2018). We will use genetic data from the INTERVAL cohort to build models to predict variation in coagulation factor levels. We will apply these models to the NIHR rare disease sequencing cohort and determine whether the genetically predicted coagulation factor levels are are associated with bleeding phenotypes."

These variants together can explain a large amount of variability in blood cell composition among healthy individuals. However, it is unknown if and how they contribute to blood related diseases. We would like to use data from participants from the NIHR BioResource project for whom full blood count data are available to investigate whether a genetic predisposition to high or low blood cell counts may predict disease status in patients for whom no causal variants have been reported. Furthermore, we curated a list of new candidate variants that show statistic evidence of potential pathogenicity. We would like to check for the presence of these variants in the above patients, in order to validate the findings."
