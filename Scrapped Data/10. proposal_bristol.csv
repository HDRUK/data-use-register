Dietary patterns have been obtained using Principal Components Analysis at the ages of 3, 4, 7 and 9 years in the ASLPAC children (1-3). For each child a continuous score was obtained for each dietary pattern. It is envisaged that there will be children who consistently score highly on individual patterns, e.g. the 'health conscious' or 'processed' patterns over time. On the other hand there are likely to be children whose diets have changed, for example, they may have initially scored highly on the 'processed' pattern and low on the 'health conscious' pattern in early childhood but reversed this trend through mid-childhood. Identifying such groups may be useful for examining the longitudinal associations between diet and a wide variety of health outcomes, by offering an alternative dietary exposure.",null,"Wednesday, 8 October, 2008","Wednesday, 8 October, 2008",Diet

and is known to predict cardiovascular events. Especially in childhood BMI the influence of family environment has attracted considerable interest. Thus previous research has shown that maternal BMI is an excellent predictor for the BMI of the offspring. However, it is unclear to what extent maternal genetic factors contribute to the offspring’s BMI beyond genetic transmission. This effect is also called cultural transmission (CT) and can be defined as the transmission of environmental factors from the parent to the offspring generation. CT can be divided into two components. Environmental influence caused by parental genetic factors

This complex, heterogeneous condition is often characterized by a triad of ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and cardiometabolic dysfunction. Despite extensive physiologic and genetic studies, the treatment of PCOS remains limited by an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder. Identification of the genetic variants and pathways associated with PCOS susceptibility may provide insights into the pathogenesis of the condition and potential targeted treatments.","If associations between a polygenic risk score for PCOS and hyperandrogenic and cardiometabolic phenotypes in children are found, the findings would indicate that biological pathways independent of ovarian function contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS. In contrast, if associations are not identified, it would suggest that ovarian function has a primary causative and/or an essential mediator role in the pathogenesis of PCOS, potentially limited to reproductive-age women. 

Broadly, this study and future studies will provide insight into the role that genetic risk factors for PCOS play in reproductive and cardiometabolic disease, and how these are shared or distinct between men and women.

Earlier age at pubertal start has been associated with earlier age at first vaginal bleeding (menarche) in girls and earlier age at voice change in boys, and with long-term consequences, including shorter adult height and psychosocial adverse effects. Although more frequent in certain ethnicities, the prevalence of precocious puberty in girls is constantly increasing worldwide, following the increase in cases of pediatric obesity. Most children with precocious puberty do not present any endocrine, metabolic, neurologic or neurosurgical condition explaining their earlier pubertal start (these cases are defined as “idiopathic” precocious puberty), but extensive work up  (including specific hormone measurements and radiological exams) is routinely performed to eliminate such conditions. An important portion of children with precocious puberty will be considered for treatment with puberty-blocking pharmacological agents, without clear evidence that these treatments will increase their adult height.

Late puberty is defined as an absence of breast development by age 13 in girls (or absence of menarche by age 15), and an absence of testicular enlargement before age 14 in boys. This phenomenon is more frequent in boys, in most of which no pathological cause is detected, and these children will end up developing a spontaneous puberty and achieve a normal adult height. Nonetheless, these children are often referred for endocrine evaluation and investigated to eliminate an underlying medical condition.

Given that age at pubertal start in the population follows a Gaussian distribution, 2.3% of normal healthy children will start their puberty at and age below 2 SD below the mean for each sex, and another 2.3% will start their puberty above 2SD above this mean. Defining which children with precocious or late puberty correspond to these 2.3% of the general population is important, since this would avoid unnecessary investigations and treatment in these patients.

Pubertal traits (age at breast development and menarche in girls,  testicular enlargement and voice change in boys, age at pubertal growth spurt in both sexes),  have a polygenic nature, and an overlapping genetic architecture in boys and girls. It has been estimated that about 50% of variation in age at menarche can be attributed to genetics. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been demonstrated to have an improving ability to identify individuals at significantly high/low predisposition towards complex diseases. Therefore, it has become possible to identify individuals who will lie at the extreme distribution of a trait, such as age at menarche in girls or age at voice change in boys.

Therefore, we posit that PRS for age at menarche in girls or age at voice change in boys, in combination with clinical risk factors (such as increased body mass index) may be able to effectively predict children diagnosed as having idiopathic precocious puberty and in which no further investigation or treatment would be required to achieve a normal adult height (within their parental target height). Also, the same scores could identify children in the opposite extreme of the normal distribution, ie children with late puberty.","Our study can potentially stratify for risk of IPP or late puberty among children, based on a score derivable at no risk and low cost. Such a stratification is likely to substantially reduce the socioeconomic burden on many families whose children have IPP or late puberty while optimizing allocation of medical resources. Our study may also illustrate whether the genetic factors captured by the PRS are constantly associated with pubertal development stages since early childhood, or when they start to become associated. Finally, by objectifying the portion of the variance in pubertal traits explained by genetic factors, we will draw interesting conclusions on the “nature vs nurture” of precocious puberty- since it is has been shown that lower socio-economic status and exposure to environmental chemicals predispose to earlier pubertal start. This is likely to shed new light upon investigations on puberty, growth and development.","Friday, 27 November, 2020","Wednesday, 2 December, 2020",Genetic epidemiology (including association studies and mendelian randomisation)

If DNA methylation is associated with genetic risk for CL/P in the general population, this would further suggest there is an association between CL/P and DNA methylation. This finding would have important implications for our understanding of the aetiology of CL/P.

In the short term, alcohol is linked to increased risk of injury and fatalities; in the long term it is associated with increased risk of cancers and diseases. Adolescent alcohol use is of particular concern as it is associated with poor mental health, brain damage, and increased risk of dependence in adulthood. Despite strong evidence that reducing the supply of alcohol in the built environment can be used to prevent or reduce consumption at a population level, in England and Australia, the prevalence of environments where alcohol is readily available is increasing yearly, often in low socio-economic urban areas.

The number of alcohol outlets in the built environment is one indicator of supply and availability. For adults, evidence consistently demonstrates an association between the number of outlets in a given area and alcohol-related behaviour. The evidence of increased availability on the health and well-being of adolescents is less clear and under examined. Most research is cross-sectional and USA-focused. The proposed project will address this important evidence gap. Our team will undertake a comprehensive longitudinal cross-national analysis of the links between alcohol availability and child and adolescent alcohol uptake with consumption, health and well-being over the adolescent and young adult years. It will use, high quality longitudinal studies of English and Australian participants followed over 17years (2002 to 2018) to examine links between changes in alcohol availability and alcohol-related behaviour and health from the school years (10-17 years) into early adulthood (27-31 years).

English data will be drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and Australian data will be drawn from the International Youth Development study (IYDS). Data will be merged with retail outlet data. Changes in the density of outlets in a participantâs local area and its link with the age of initiation and consumption will be examined. Limitations of previous study designs will be addressed by employing novel cross-lagged panel analysis techniques, which mimic an RCT and can be used to develop causal evidence with longitudinal data. Multi-level growth, elasticity, and latent class modelling will be used to investigate issues neglected in the international literature relating to development and policy. The core research questions will be: Does density exposure at early ages have a sustained effect on child and adolescent behaviour? How does density exposure affect the severity and breadth of alcohol-related problems of young people? Are there maximum and minimum availability levels associated with adolescent alcohol-related behaviour and health? Cross-national comparisons will be made and socioeconomic sub-group analyses will be undertaken. An economic evaluation of the impact of adolescent consumption on health and services will be completed. To assist with translation and impact an analysis of policy and legal barriers and facilitators associated with opening or opposing of new alcohol outlets will also be undertaken.

The hypotheses guiding this research proposal are:

1.	Exposure to higher density of alcohol sales outlets will predict an earlier age of uptake (initiation of use) of alcohol by adolescents (10-17 years of age) and increases the risk and rate of progressing to greater alcohol use across adolescence and early adulthood.

2.	Over time, changes in alcohol sales outlets will be associated with changes in the extent to which adolescents report illegally purchasing alcohol, and changes in the extent to which they report parents supply alcohol to them.

3.	Increased costs (health and broader societal), lower productivity and poorer health (including mental health) are expected in adolescents who are exposed to higher alcohol outlet densities.","The detrimental and causal impact of alcohol on non-communicable disease is well understood as are the links between alcohol availability, alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms in adults. It is much less clear how increasing alcohol availability in local, and especially urban, built environments is causally linked to the uptake and frequency of consumption by children and adolescents, and the extent to which this may impact on health and well-being and consumption later in life. Thus, for this project, the academic impact of publishing high-quality, definitive evidence identifying these links is critical to the societal and policy impact of the proposed research. Using cross-national, longitudinal datasets and novel analyses, we will generate the best available evidence on how increasing alcohol outlets in cities is affecting children and adolescents’ alcohol use, their health and futures and the costs to local and national governments of trends in alcohol consumption among young people. The planned analyses will also identify what factors facilitate or impede the regulation of alcohol outlets in the community. 

From the first year we will interview stakeholders and policy makers (as part of WP6) to identify key questions that guide current licencing policy and ensure that our analyses addresses these issues. We will use qualitative analyses of interview data, observations of the history of licencing objections and analyses of local legalisation and practices to map out the processes by which policy is translated into licencing practice in Bristol and Melbourne. 

To maximise the impact of the project we are in the process of establishing an Expert Study Advocacy and Advisory Group (SAAG), for which we already have support from Public Health England, Public Health Association of Australia, the Institute of Alcohol Studies and from academia (Letters of Support included), and we aim to include further representation from stakeholders and the general public. The SAAG will be established to help identify how to best facilitate and promote findings. We anticipate that, we will write a series of brief policy and community information sheets targeting policy makers and community leaders. These will outline the main findings and recommendations arising from our research, including recommendations for policy and legislative change. We will also provide a “managing the process” community resource pack. It is easy to find “what-to-do” guidelines if you want to get a new alcohol licence  (e.g., https://impos.com.au/blog/alcohol-licence-guide-australia/) and, for example, the VCGLR, sets out clearly how to object to new licences (https://www.vcglr.vic.gov.au/community-services/objecting-liquor-licence-application). However, it is less clear how community representatives can manage extant processes and advocate for policy and practice change. We will provide evidence-based guidelines to managing these processes that link directly to local policy frameworks. 

In addition, towards the end of the project we will we will run three workshops, one for community leaders in Melbourne and one for legislators in Canberra, while in the UK one workshop will be organised (location to be decided) for policy makers, local councils, NGOs, other stakeholders and the general public. These workshops will allow us to present not only the results of our data analyses but also our recommendations for policy and practice change that are compatible with a harm minimisation approach to the marketing of alcohol products. These workshops will highlight our findings in terms of the health, community and economic impact of current policies. We will present alternative legislative and policy futures and map out their likely health, community and economic consequences, based on our results. We will also identify road maps to harm minimisation policy development.","Tuesday, 29 October, 2019","Thursday, 31 October, 2019","Social Science, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Qualitative study, Statistical methods, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Social science, Statistical methods"

This project aims to combine research from the Bristol Neonatal Gene Study and from ALSPAC. This will represent an interesting opportunity to study in detail the effect of specific genetic and epigenetic variants both in newborns and in childhood. We specifically aim to study the main candidate pathways involved in perinatal brain injuries (glutamate signalling and inflammation) and long-term motor, cognitive and behavioural outcomes. We have produced interesting preliminary findings within the Bristol Neonatal Gene Study, which support the involvement of candidate genetic variants in the glutamate signalling and inflammation pathways. The ALSPAC cohort provides a unique opportunity to validate and add to these findings in a large sample with genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic data collected longitudinally from birth to childhood. With the availability of maternal data, it also offers the opportunity to expand the analysis to maternal-neonatal gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. We have the appropriate expertise in genetic and epigenetic research required for this project.  In addition, we are coupling this approach with in vivo work on animal models of newborn brain injuries, exploring the (dys)regulation of key genes involved in glutamate transport and inflammation during perinatal insults.","Genetic and epigenetic biomarkers may provide invaluable tools to predict the risk of brain injuries at birth and potentially long before the onset of labour. They may also provide a tool to identify babies who are more likely to respond to treatment, both in the short- and long-term. Both glutamate signalling and inflammation are ideal candidates for a pharmacogenomics approach for existing and novel drugs targeting these pathways. The study may also generate hypotheses about manipulating DNA methylation to achieve neuroprotection. We expect that through a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of injury it will be possible to improve early identification, diagnosis and treatment, ultimately providing a better prognosis for these newborns. This is likely to help mothers, families and clinicians making more informed and personalised decisions when planning pregnancy, childbirth and child follow-up, contributing to the push of neonatal care towards prediction and prevention.","Tuesday, 12 June, 2018",null,"Genetics, Neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood, Gene mapping, GWAS, Statistical methods, Cognition - cognitive function, Epigenetics, Genetic epidemiology, Genetics, Genome wide association study, Mendelian randomisation, Neurology, Statistical methods"

Four million of these are children. The level of child poverty is rising, and the rate is projected to accelerate in coming years.  Growing up in a deprived environment can have a profoundly negative effect on a childâs development. Children from deprived backgrounds are more likely to be placed in special education, fail courses, and complete fewer years of schooling. But the adversities children encounter extend well beyond economic hardship and incorporate multiple familial factors like chaotic home life, poor parental mental and physical health, lack of community support, poor schooling and communication difficulties. These factors have a well-documented impact on multiple child outcomes including educational attainment, mental health, and behaviour. This is a global problem. Up to 50% of children and adolescents growing up worldwide experience at least one episode of childhood adversity in early life: 30% of all mental health problems are attributable to such adversity. The effects are also persistent â early adversity can set a life-long trajectory associated with poor physical and mental well-being and significantly worse occupational and economic outcomes. This results in an inter-generational cycle of disadvantage where deprivation impacts each subsequent generation. Supporting young people who face adversity is one of the major modern challenges for educators, practitioners and policy-makers, as they work to reduce educational under-attainment, poor economic outcomes and address the burgeoning mental health crisis.","The research will benefit national policy-makers, practitioners working in educational and clinical practice, those responsible for child welfare in other institutions, and ultimately children and families who are at risk.","Tuesday, 7 January, 2020","Friday, 10 January, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Cognitive impairment, Statistical methods, Development"

Individuals who suffer stressful experiences early in life tend to show faster physiological development, an effect known as ‘psychosocial age acceleration’. Evolutionary theories predict that individuals who experience accelerated ageing are more likely to become risk-takers, as their likelihood of morbidity and mortality later in life is increased, and they therefore have less to lose and more to gain by taking risks. This predicts a ‘pace-of-life’ syndrome in which individuals exposed to early stress adopt a “live fast, die young” attitude, whereas those under less stress are more risk averse (Ellis et al. 2009; DOI: 10.1007/s12110-009-9063-7). Alternatively, the causality could be reversed – increased risk-taking could increase stress, and thereby accelerate ageing. As of yet, there are hardly any tests of these predictions in humans, and none that investigate causality. In this project, we will test whether groups of people who have inherited different genetic variants for epigenetic age acceleration differ in their risk-taking behaviour; or, conversely, whether those who have inherited different genetic variants for risk-taking behaviour differ in epigenetic markers of ageing.","This project will be the first to investigate the causal relationship between biological aging and risk-taking behaviours.

Several studies have indicated that age at menarche is associated with father absence, in that females who do not live with their father in childhood reach reproductive age faster (Moffitt et al., 1992). These findings present an evolutionary puzzle as decreased parental investment, such as resulting from an absent father, ought to negatively impact offspring fitness, resulting in delayed reproduction.  One set of adaptive explanations (Belsky et al., 1991) suggests that individuals alter their reproductive decision-making based on early-life adversity, such as father absence, as this is a cue for a high-mortality environment, in which case earlier reproduction may increase reproductive success.  However, a recent alternative adaptive theory based on inclusive fitness considerations suggests that these father absence effects reflect the conflict between investing in one’s own reproduction (for direct fitness benefits) and investing in their mother’s reproduction (i.e., investing in siblings for indirect fitness benefits). Children are more likely to forego reproduction and invest in siblings if these are full siblings, due to higher relatedness coefficients, while with half- or step-siblings, which would be associated with father absence, children are more likely to invest in their own reproduction (Moya & Sear, 2014).  To date, no tests of these competing hypotheses have been conducted. I therefore aim to explore the relative merits of each of these adaptive theories for the observed accelerated reproductive timing associated with father absence.",null,"Tuesday, 25 April, 2017","Wednesday, 26 April, 2017","Anthropology, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Development, Fathers, Puberty, Siblings, Inclusive fitness, Evolution, Ecology, Reproductive decision-making"

Schools can provide an environment that encourages positive mental health at an early age and prevents poor mental health in later years. Positive relationships with peers and positive perceptions of school connectedness (that is, adolescentsâ sense of belonging and attachment to school) are associated with increases in adolescentsâ psychosocial wellbeing and decreases in the number of mental health issues. School absenteeism is also associated with an increased risk of self-harm. Levels of school absenteeism may be reduced if early school experiences are of a positive nature. There is also an association of suicidal and non-suicidal self-harm with adverse experiences at school and even minor events like not enjoying school or class work and the feeling about teachers being unclear with respect to their behaviour.

However, the sample size was relatively limited (only 20 subjects were term and low birthweight). ALSPAC offers an excellent opportunity to examine this hypothesis in more depth and in a much larger sample (approximately 7,500 subjects).",null,"Thursday, 11 April, 2013","Thursday, 11 April, 2013","Growth, Genetics"

People with DCD find tasks such as throwing a ball, writing, or brushing their teeth extremely difficult, and are more likely to struggle academically even though they are just as smart. Despite being extremely common, we understand little of why some children get DCD.

We know that sometimes DCD can run in families but we don't understand the causes of this. This study will be the first to look for these inherited causes. We will use genetic data from the ALSPAC cohort to find genes that are underlying DCD. This will help us to understand how these genes affect the pathways that are required in a developing brain.

We will also use this genetic information to help us understand why some children go on to develop other difficulties like ADHD or language problems, whereas other children do not. We can look into how these behaviours interact with the movement and planning difficulties seen in DCD, and whether they are important in the development of these behaviours in typically developing children.","The primary outcome of this study is to generate pilot data to identify the first genes involved in DCD. The discovery of the first DCD gene will generate substantial interest. This will place PI Dr Hayley Mountford at the centre of a new and exciting field of study, and form the basis for future, larger research endeavours. 
 
Academic outputs will be shared in the form of research articles, with the potential for two to three high impact papers from this study (novel genes, subgroup genetic findings, and GWAS). As this project is of interest to both a human genetics audience and a psychology/ DCD audience, it is important to present to both these subject areas. Findings will be shared by PI Mountford presenting at Europe’s preeminent genetics conference (European Societs of Human Genetics) and attending a DCD specialist meeting in the second year of the project. Similarly, presence at international meetings will build her presence in the field, leading to wider patient cohorts with the ultimate aim to lead the study of DCD genetics, globally. 

CI Professor Anna Barnett is a world leader in DCD research and will facilitate connections to patient groups such as the Dyspraxia Foundation. PI Mountford will write an accessible article on key findings for the Dyspraxia Foundation, to engage with the public particularly those affected by DCD. Plus, PI Mountford will further develop her public engagement to interact with DCD groups, building a reputation as a geneticist.","Tuesday, 25 June, 2019","Tuesday, 25 June, 2019","Genetics, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Cognitive impairment, Learning difficulty, Speech/language problem, Developmental coordination disorder

Psychosocial stressors in early childhood, such as experiencing parental substance use or depression, violence, household chaos, or negative life events, have been linked to health problems such as CVD and obesity in adulthood. Changes in biology and behavior have both been proposed to link early stress and later health problems. One proposed mechanism between early stress and later CVD risk is dysregulation in cortisol, a hormone responsible for responding to stress and regulating daily processes like metabolism. It is currently unknown whether cortisol dysregulation mediates the association between early psychosocial stress and adolescent biological and behavioral risk for CVD and obesity.

(1-12)  Metabolic health has been defined according to the presence or absence of a minimum number of cardiometabolic risk factors defined according to clinical cut-points (i.e. elevated waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, low HDL-cholesterol, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP), or pharmacological treatment for these parameters). Obesity is associated with poor metabolic health, but metabolically unhealthy individuals may be at high risk of metabolic diseases, independent of BMI (metabolically unhealthy normal-weight phenotype, MUHNW)  and obese individuals that are metabolically healthy may have similar disease risk to their lean counterparts (metabolically healthy obese phenotype, MHO). (1) Analysis of data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that a substantial proportion of overweight or obese individuals are metabolically healthy and over 30% of normal weight individuals are cardiometabolically unhealthy. (13)  The etiologies of the associations between these phenotypes and cardiometabolic disease risk are unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of using a metabolomics approach to explore the concepts of MUHNW and MHO in relation to cardiometabolic disease endpoints. For example, an 'obese metabolome' (metabolites related to insulin resistance, branched chain and aromatic amino acids, nucleotide metabolites, and several lipid classes) associated with a 2 to 5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular events, independent of BMI, in the TwinsUK cohort. (14) Matched for BMI, MUHNW individuals had higher visceral adiposity, higher blood pressure and were also more likely to become obese over time compared with their metabolically healthy lean counterparts. Such findings point towards the potential of metabolomics for disease risk stratification, where BMI alone can fail to identify a significant proportion of individuals that may be at risk for cardiometabolic disease. We propose to leverage the unique resources of COMETS to determine metabolites associated with metabolic health, how this profile associates with obesity-relevant diseases (i.e. obesity-related cancers and cardiovascular disease), and the extent to which metabolites mediate the association of body mass index with these outcomes.","We propose to leverage the unique resources of COMETS to determine metabolites associated with metabolic health, how this profile associates with obesity-relevant diseases (i.e. obesity-related cancers and cardiovascular disease), and the extent to which metabolites mediate the association of body mass index with these outcomes.","Thursday, 5 November, 2020","Friday, 13 November, 2020","Epidemiology, Diabetes, Obesity, Ageing, Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., BMI, Metabolic - metabolism"

We've previously found that a combination of factors is more important for health compared with single factors alone. We also plan to use a new, reproducible laboratory technique, known as metabolomics, to record over 220 measures of blood that indicate a range of metabolic processes. This will help us find out in much more detail than ever before how behaviour leads to better cardiovascular health via metabolic pathways. When we know more about the pathway that leads from lifestyle to disease we will be better able to predict who will stay healthy and who will not from their behaviours. We also plan to explore how excess body weight (BMI) is related to cardiovascular health via metabolic pathways, which could help to find new ways of breaking the link between high BMI and poor health by developing new medications to target specific bits of metabolism that go wrong when body weight increases.

We'll be using information from diet diaries, activity monitors and blood samples that have already been provided by Children of the 90s participants when they were teenagers. We'll be combining this with information from another group of teenagers that live in Malaysia, using an approach called cross-cultural analysis, which will enable us to be more certain that any associations we see between behaviour and metabolism or metabolism and cardiovascular health are really true and not just coincidental.","Cross-cultural analyses of MyHearts and ALSPAC will enable improved causal inferences to be made on associations between health behaviours and metabolite profile changes during adolescence. Identifying the metabolic intermediates between poor health behaviours and long-term metabolic risk has the potential to offer objective methods for monitoring health, looking at responses to intervention and preventing long-term risk of cardiometabolic disease.","Wednesday, 14 February, 2018","Wednesday, 14 February, 2018","Epidemiology, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, Metabolomics, Biological samples -e.g. blood, cell lines, saliva, etc., Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Puberty, Sex differences, Blood pressure, BMI, Cardiovascular, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Metabolic - metabolism, Methods - e.g. cross cohort analysis, data mining, mendelian randomisation, etc., Nutrition - breast feeding, diet, Physical - activity, fitness, function"

However, why some individuals with ADHD show higher levels of resilience and better outcomes compared to others is not yet well understood. One way of defining resilience is better-than-expected long-term mental health outcome than predicted by initial severity of childhood ADHD.

Fetal neurodevelopment is solely dependent on maternal thyroid hormone in the first trimester of pregnancy, and though fetal production of thyroid hormone begins during the second trimester, the developing fetus remains partially reliant on maternally supplied thyroid hormone for the remainder of the pregnancy (1).

Thyroid hormone disorders are major determinants of maternal pregnancy related complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes (2, 3). Maternal hypothyroxinemia has been found to be associated with preterm birth,  low birth weight, the head growth of young child, placental abruption, cognitive delay and many other abnormal neurobehavioral development of affected offspring (4-9). Maternal hyperthyroidism is also highly associated with maternal and fetal adverse events, such as pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction (5). All these adverse events can in turn disrupt the development of the nervous system resulting in offspring poor neurodevelopment.

Exposures during pregnancy may  also result in permanent negative health outcomes among exposed offspring and we aim to investigate the impact of maternal thyroid function on offspring’s neurobehavioral and other health outcomes in early childhood and adolescence. Several studies reported that both maternal and neonatal thyroid function status affects the neurophysiology of the offspring prior to adolescence. However, there is a dearth of information regarding its effect on behavioural and psychiatric disorders.

Compared with their later onset counterparts, individuals with an onset of conduct problems in early childhood are at high risk for persistent criminal behaviors and the development of antisocial personality disorder (2); these youth are often also impaired in multiple settings (social, educational and interpersonal) and are at increased risk for developing mental and physical health problems in adulthood (3). Research has highlighted that childhood onset individuals can present impaired cognitive (e.g., IQ, attention, inhibition) and emotional (e.g., callousness, anxiety, depression) function (4-6), and the role of neurobiological factors in explaining persistent offending in the early onset group has attracted attention. However, only a handful of neuroimaging studies to date have focused on children with conduct problems and these have often identified structural and functional atypicalities in affect processing and affect regulation areas of the brain (e.g. amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) (7). Most brain imaging studies, however, have either not assessed the timing of onset of conduct problems (8, 9), or are based on cross-sectional designs with retrospective reporting used to establish childhood onset (10). Moreover, few published neuroimaging studies have taken into account the risk environments (e.g., poverty, stressful life events, poor parenting) that associate with abnormal brain structure and/or function, and potential biological mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) that could at least partially explain brain differences for those exposed to chronic risk. These two limitations are important to redress, for at least three reasons. First, childhood onset children are shown to be exposed to a high incidence of prenatal and early postnatal risks that also associate with impaired (long-term) brain function and structure (11). Second, in certain studies, risk exposures explain differences in the cognitive functioning of delinquents (12). Third, a potential biological mechanism that can affect both the structure and function of the brain, on the experience of chronic risk, is epigenetics (13, 14).

Improvement in the management of risk pregnancies and neonatal care procedures in the last four decades have increased survival rates of all preterm born neonates and particularly those born very preterm. However, preterm birth has been linked to many long-term sequels related to cognitive function and mental health which are associated with gestational age at birth. Negative consequences are more likely among those born very preterm (<32nd week gestation), compared to moderate preterm (32nd-33rd weeks gestation) and late preterm children (34th-36th weeks gestation) but the latter two groups have less frequently been studied. In this project we study positive and negative aspects of wellbeing in preterm children, adolescents, and young adults and the role of protective factors for wellbeing potentially leading to resilience. Positive wellbeing involves high self-esteem and mental wellbeing, while negative wellbeing is defined by emotional and behavioural problems. We are studying protective factors on the individual level (academic skills, personality factors) and micro-system factors (family climate, parental mental health, peer relations). To answer these questions we analyse simultaneously data from six cohort studies (ALSPAC, British Cohort Study, Bavarian Longitudinal Study, Basel Study of Preterm Children, Millennium Cohort Study, and National Child Development Study) from UK, Germany, and Switzerland. Comparisons between the cohorts allow investigating differences between countries and epochs with different neonatal care procedures.","The research will inform whether preterm children, adolescents, and adults differ regarding positive and negative wellbeing from term born peers. Gaps in previous research that this project is going to fill are in particular regarding 
-positive aspects of wellbeing (while there is more research on negative aspects),
-differences in MPT and LPT (while there is more research on VPT),
-changes across preterm cohorts born in 1958, 1970, 1991, and 2000,
-potential effects of protective and resilience factors for preterms.
Studying protective and resilience factors is particularly important as it may help to identify potential targets for interventions improving the long-term development of those born preterm.","Tuesday, 6 November, 2018","Tuesday, 6 November, 2018","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Questionnaires, Surveys, Birth outcomes, Cognition - cognitive function, Development, Parenting, Psychology - personality"

Additional mental health problems add burden to those with ASD, their carers and their wider family. Research highlighting the elevated rates of suicide and self-harm among those with ASD make clear the extent and possible effects of mental health difficulties for this group, with research by both Cassidy et al. (2014) and Culpin et al. (2018) identifying depression as a key factor in the suicidal ideation and self-harm shown by those on the autism spectrum.","The proposed study's focus on mental health is currently one of the key research priorities in the field of ASD research, and the study will have a number of areas of impact. Firstly, the study will benefit researchers in the fields of ASD and mental health by providing much needed synthesis of information from population-based sources, academic and research impact will be via dissemination in open-access peer reviewed journal articles and presentations at both national and international conferences. Secondly, the study will benefit clinicians working with individuals with ASD and their families, by providing clarity of information about mental health problems experienced by this group. Again, dissemination of information will be via peer reviewed journal articles and presentations at clinically attended conferences, this will facilitate societal and economic impact, in terms of informing about mental health and the possible need for targeted services for this group. Finally, the study will benefit those with ASD themselves and their families/carers. By examining types and factors related to mental health problems the study will add much needed quantitative population-based information to add to the debate about recognition and treatment of problems for this group, with the aim of improving the targeting of services and enhancing quality of life. The findings will have impact for this group via dissemination at talks open to the general public, via parent groups, schools, colleges and open lectures about our work (a model we have used with great success for the SR Study). Additionally, the research findings and their implications will be publicised through websites and social media (e.g. the Twitter account@Happelab>7,000 followers). We will also share information through the National Autistic Society, Autistica and the NAHT National Forum for Neuroscience and Special Education (of which Prof Happé is a co-founder) to reach stakeholders.","Wednesday, 12 June, 2019","Thursday, 13 June, 2019","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Statistical methods, Autism

Howard | Department of Health Services and Population Research (United Kingdom),"Vishal Bhavsar, Professor Dieter Wolke","Is mental illness related to the subsequent experience of violence, and is this mediated by substance use or social networks?","Violence, towards both men and women, is an important public health problem and results in reduced wellbeing, worse quality of life and greater use of care and allied services. People with mental illness often report greater experience of violence and crimes, as victims, than those without mental illness. However, this research area is limited by challenges in routinely enquiring about and measuring violence and crimes using self-report, a lack of follow-up studies, and differences between those who choose to participate in studies, or report violence, and those who do not. Evidence on a possible relationship between mental illness and later exposure to violence and crime is inconclusive. My ALSPAC proposal will examine whether mental disorders increase risk of later exposure to physical and sexual violence and whether this relationship is explained(mediated) by changes in social behaviour which occur as a result of mental illness, but which also increase risk for later experience of violence.  This proposal forms part of a funding application to study this question across different types of data to arrive at stronger conclusions - observational data from a birth cohort study(ALSPAC, the present proposal), electronic health record data from London, and national data from Sweden. Identifying the reasons for association between mental disorder and subsequent experience of physical and sexual violence could be important in prediction, and in improving safety and quality of life in people with mental illness.","Results of analyses wil be reported in the scientific literature, open access where possible. 
Findings will be integrated into lay reports for mental health interest groups, charities, and policy makers, focusing on drawing attention to the higher frequency of violent experiences among those with mental illness, and potential explanations.","Thursday, 16 November, 2017","Thursday, 16 November, 2017","Epidemiology, Violence, bullying, victimisation., Computer simulations/modelling/algorithms, Statistical methods, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution, Injury (including accidents), Sex differences, Social science, Statistical methods"

Concomitantly, the use of vegetable oils and grain feeding of livestock has resulted in an increase in the intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and a decrease in n-3 PUFA, especially the long chain PUFA (LCPUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) particularly found in fish and this has been hypothesized to be a potential cause of childhood asthma. LCPUFA influence immune regulation and some observational studies have reported an association between n-3 LCPUFA deprived diet during pregnancy and increased risk of asthma and related disorders in the offspring. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation to pregnant women have generally been under-powered and shown ambiguous results. We recently conducted a double-blind RCT of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during third trimester of pregnancy in an unselected group of 743 pregnant Danish women from the COPSAC2010 cohort showing that n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in pregnancy was associated with reduced risk of asthma in the offspring (Bisgaard et al. NEJM 2016). Specifically, the preventive effect of supplementation was highest in children of mothers with intake and blood-levels of EPA+DHA prior to the intervention and with FADS gene risk variants (minor allele at rs1535). A similar tendency was seen for allergic rhinitis.

Variants in the maternal fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene region (rs1535 and closely correlated SNPs) have been reported to be associated with EPA and DHA levels during pregnancy. Child genotype has been shown to have smaller but independent effect on cord blood levels of EPA and DHA. This gene variation therefore provide an opportunity to study genetically the hypothesis that prenatal n-3 LCPUFA levels affect the risk of asthma in the offspring. This would support that supplementation with n-3 LCPUFA during pregnancy could prevent asthma in the offspring and therefore could have large importance for asthma prevention.",null,"Thursday, 19 January, 2017","Wednesday, 25 January, 2017","Genetics, Allergy, Eczema, Respiratory - asthma, Simple association study between a candidate gene variant (rs1535) and clinical outcomes., Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution, Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc., Mothers - maternal age, menopause, obstetrics, Methods - e.g. cross cohort analysis, data mining, mendelian randomisation, etc."

Sexual orientation is an important feature of human nature and diversity. While most people identify as heterosexual (attracted to the opposite sex), a substantial number of the population identify as non-heterosexual. This includes lesbian, gay, and bisexual identification as well as a range of emerging sexualities (such as asexual). Scholars from across medicine, behavioural and social sciences have also found that nonheterosexual people are at greater risk of common mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and suicide compared to heterosexual people. These problems tend to start early in adolescence among nonheterosexual people. It is important to understand the social, psychological, and biological factors that might be involved in contributing to this mental health disparity. This will help researchers to identify the most important risk factors and develop interventions (e.g., psychological interventions) to reduce the burden of these problems on nonheterosexual people. Studies using data from ALSPAC have already helped to identify some of these risk factors and thus continued measurement of sexual orientation in the cohort will prove invaluable to future researchers. In general, future basic and applied scientific research on sexual orientation will provide greater social and cultural understanding of the diversity in human sexuality.",N/A,"Wednesday, 27 March, 2019","Monday, 1 April, 2019","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Birth outcomes"

However, what specific aspects of maternal behaviour are important or how to change them through interventions is less clear. Research into the causes and consequences of variations in parenting is important for determining how parenting might be modified to improve long-term health and wellbeing in children.

We propose to include novel measures into the next generation of ALSPAC in order to understand more about how maternal behaviour develops during pregnancy and the impact that it has on the development of the child.

We propose to measure how mothers respond to pictures of baby faces during pregnancy to further understand how women prepare to respond to their babies when they are born. Once the babies are born we propose to use ‘wearable’ cameras in mothers and babies (worn on headbands) to capture naturalistic behaviours. We can then see how mothers reactions in pregnancy relate to how they behaviour after birth. This might help us to understand how to help mothers (who might be struggling, for example depressed mothers) better prepare for motherhood. Finally we plan to measures the child’s ability on a number of important cognitive tasks at age 3 years old, to investigate how different maternal behaviours can promote the development of these skills.",null,"Wednesday, 28 October, 2015","Wednesday, 28 October, 2015","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Offspring, Parenting, Psychology - personality"

In this work a range of circulating metabolites were measured and a genome-wide association study conducted to find genetic variants associated with those metabolites.  The unique aspect of this discovery analysis was the kind of genetic data that was used.  Researchers made use of a brand new resource which provides a more detailed genetic profile than has previously been available in large cohort studies - that is, genetic data imputed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC). By combining together multiple cohorts, the reference panels produced by the HRC project increase the accuracy of the genotype imputation, especially at low-frequency variants, and the number of imputable variants, thus increasing the power of association studies.  Ultimately, this means researchers can probe areas of the genome which have up until now been inaccessible.  Through this approach, researchers at the University of Exeter have identified what they believe to be novel genetic associations and are now seeking to validate those associations.

Common complications of human pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, often have unknown etiology but feature contributions from genetic and non-genetic causes.  DNA exists in the cell bound by proteins and other molecules, forming a structure known as chromatin.  The structural conformation of chromatin is just as important as the DNA code itself, since chromatin structure dictates which components of DNA are active, and therefore able to regulate the cell.  Formalin-fixed placentas maintain the structural conformation of their chromatin, making them a uniquely valuable resource to identify the location and activity of regulatory DNA.  My proposal seeks to investigate the causes of preeclampsia by comparing the chromatin structure in formalin-fixed placentas from control pregnancies and those complicated with preeclampsia.  I will focus on regions of non-coding DNA that regulate gene activity, so-called gene promoters and enhancers, including a special subset of these regions known as transposons.  Placental chromatin exhibits a unique structure compared to other tissues, featuring an open conformation around transposons, indicative of their activity in placenta. The activity of gene-regulatory DNA provides the basis of tissue and organ-specific developmental programs. As such, the development and function of the placenta is dictated by the activity of regulatory DNA, and structural variation at these regions can cause disease. I will test the hypothesis that chromatin structure variation of DNA regulatory sequences contributes to the causes of preeclampsia.","This research will provide proof-of-principal that archived placental samples can provide information on the gene regulatory status of the genome of the sample. Further, there will be a direct impact of the data provided from the samples in this study, in the identification of non-coding regulatory regions that are potentially involved in preeclampsia. This would lead to future expansion of the study into related pregnancy complications such as fetal growth restriction, pre-term birth, and recurrent miscarriage. 

This study will provide candidate genomic sequences for future research, as well as genetic screening and therapy in two ways: Most disease associated sequence variation is found in non-coding regions, and our data will be an important resource, revealing non-coding candidate regulatory regions impacted by epigenetic variation, which indicates that their genetic variation may also be disease-causing. In the future it will be key to investigate the presence of SNPs in candidate regulatory regions that we identify, which may alter transcription factor binding sites, for example, affecting gene expression. Secondly, the proposal investigates epigenetic variation between preeclampsia and controls, variation that is potentially impacted by environmental conditions and uniquely amenable to therapeutic intervention. Finally, by focusing our analysis on transposons, which are highly repetitive regions and poorly understood, this project will elucidate novel candidate genes and regulatory pathways that may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.","Thursday, 23 July, 2020","Thursday, 23 July, 2020","Developmental biology, Fertility/infertility, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., DNA sequencing, Chromatin immunoprecipitation, Biological samples -e.g. blood, cell lines, saliva, etc., Birth outcomes, Development, Epigenetics, Expression, Genetic epidemiology, Genomics, Growth, Mothers - maternal age, menopause, obstetrics"

But in the UK, where changes to welfare policy have been accompanied by an explosion in foodbank use, social differences in underweight must be reassessed. This project will be the first comprehensive investigation of present-day inequalities in low body weight in Britain. Considering adults, children and adolescents, we will describe the extent of inequalities, and identify the most vulnerable groups. We will shed light on causes, by comparing inequalities in present-day UK with inequalities in other policy contexts: the UK in the 1990s and 2000s, and Norway from the 1980s to the present day.

Starkly raised risk of underweight was recently found among British adult jobseekers, and higher risk of thinness among younger disadvantaged children. Reported after substantial changes to welfare policy, it is not clear if such inequalities existed before those changes, if similar patterns are seen in other countries, or which other disadvantaged groups are affected. We will find out when these patterns first emerged in the UK, by comparing data from the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. To see if they only occur in certain policy contexts â strongly suggesting they are avoidable - we will also use data from Norway, which in the same period had different welfare policies and a lower poverty rate. To identify other vulnerable groups, we will look at underweight among adults in low-income employment, and children and adolescents in households affected by unemployment and low-income employment.

The project therefore fills three urgent needs: to describe the extent of inequalities in low body weight, to identify groups of vulnerable adults and children, and to understand the causes of these inequalities. Policymakers currently do not have the knowledge required to consider inequalities across the full body weight range, and this project will fill that gap.","1.	Unlike with obesity, we simply do not know enough about inequalities in low body weight for decision-makers to consider them in policy. This project will provide that knowledge.
2.	By providing the first large-scale evidence of social inequalities in body weight across the entire range, results can be used by non-profit groups aiming to reduce the impact of poverty on nutrition and health.
3.	Through both routes, the people who ultimately stand to benefit most will be individuals and families affected by low income, unemployment, and changes to welfare policy.","Friday, 10 January, 2020","Tuesday, 14 January, 2020","Epidemiology, Obesity, Statistical methods, BMI, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Social science"

Our prior proposal (approved and ongoing) investigates AUDITORY sensitivities (hyperacusis and misophonia; where sounds cause pain, or distress/anger respectively). However, sound-difficulties are just one branch of a broader profile which can affect multiple senses, and cause considerable negative impact in day to day life. For example, broad sensory sensitivities play a significant role in anxiety disorder (sometimes via neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism). With poor well-being and anxiety placing substantial financial burden on society (e.g., £12 billion invested annually by the NHS), our study aims to better understand sensory sensitivities and aversions with a questionnaire that identifies those ALSPAC participants who have such difficulties across multiple senses. The wealth of ALSPAC back-data will then allow us to “reach back” into their childhood, to explore their early development in terms of wellbeing, mental health, mood and feelings (DAWBA, Strengths and difficulties, mood and feelings, PANAS, Locus of control, anxiety) as well as their cognitive skills (eg., attention tasks), and schooling attainment (school key stage linked data). We predict that adults with sensory sensitivities/aversions were likely already expressing poorer mental well-being at a younger age, and may have heightened scores on tasks such as attention-to-detail and obsessive control, and potentially lower scores on school attendance and attainment.","The impact of our research is likely to be considerable, both in terms of developments in the field, and also on the lives of people who struggle with sensory difficulties. For the field, our work aims to make the first distinction between sensory SENSITIVITIES (caused by over-stimulation; i.e., sensory bombardment) and sensory AVERSIONS (caused by an affective or emotional dysregulation; e.g., anger-responses). And within this latter we aim to provide a grand theory of sensory aversions where these had been studied previously only in the auditory domain (as misophonia). In other words, we hope to show for the first time that misophonia may be a sub-category of a wider family of aversions we term misesthesia (hatred of sensations), and that these differ in quality and aetiology to sensory sensitivities.","Tuesday, 2 February, 2021","Thursday, 4 February, 2021","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Developmental disorders - autism, Eating disorders - anorexia, bulimia, Mental health, Sensory differences; sensory sensitivities ; sensory aversions, Statistical methods, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Development, Intelligence - memory, Mothers - maternal age, menopause, obstetrics, Parenting, Psychology - personality"

The first part of the study will focus on the detailed information on respiratory health and socio-economic factors in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to determine the association of socio-economic deprivation and respiratory outcomes during childhood. We will further investigate these associations by attempting to identify explanatory variables, including lifestyle (smoking, diet) and environmental exposures. Observed associations will then be examined using a lifecourse epidemiological approach to investigate whether associations that we observe in a contemporary population of children (ALSPAC) are reproducible across previous generations in the United Kingdom and whether deprivation in childhood is associated with adult respiratory outcomes, independently of adult socio-economic status. In turn, this will allow us to explore the possible effects of social mobility on adult respiratory health. The project brings together expertise on the analysis of inequalities in health from an economics perspective, with a focus on measures of access to resources, and the exploitation of dynamics in data and the use of GIS tools to map local features to individuals (in the Department of Economics), childhood respiratory epidemiology, including assessment of asthma and lung function in a longitudinal birth cohort sample (Department of Community-based Medicine) and the multidisciplinary specialty of lifecourse epidemiology, including access to archived information on other existing cohorts (Department of Social Medicine).

epidemiology: methodological innovation and application to studies of obesity and card","Aim:Life course epidemiology is the study of how exposures during gestation, childhood, adolescence and adulthood influence later health and wellbeing. Analysis of data from across the life course enables us to examine the dynamic ways in which variables of interest change and interact across a person's life span, determinants of these changes, and how the pattern of change relates to later health. A key focus within life course studies is analysis of mediation, i.e. the chain of intermediate processes that links an exposure to an outcome. Well-executed mediation studies are a crucial next step for the field of life course epidemiology. They represent an opportunity to increase understanding of pathways and mechanisms by studying the causal chains that explain exposure-outcome associations. Mediation analysis can therefore provide aetiological insight and identify potential intervention targets. In recent years, the epidemiological literature has given much more consideration to some of the statistical issues in mediation analysis than was the case previously; epidemiologists are now much more likely to give careful thought to mediator-outcome confounding and the potential resultant collider bias, and methods are now available that allow for exposure-mediator interactions or for situations where a confounder of the mediation-outcome association is caused by the exposure. Counterfactual theory has been used to show that the 'total' effect of an exposure on an outcome can be decomposed into the 'natural' direct and indirect effects, and methods for identifying these effects have been developed. However, several challenges remain. In this proposal, I will address 2 key issues in mediation analysis: 1) mediation analysis with repeated measures data, and 2) causal mediation analysis using Mendelian Randomization (MR), and will apply appropriate methods to address the following 2 questions of public health importance in the field of adiposity and cardiometabolic health:i) Whether the trajectory of growth and development affects cardiometabolic health independently of final attained adiposity.",null,"Tuesday, 9 September, 2014","Wednesday, 10 September, 2014","Cardiovascular , Obesity"

Clearly, we would not expect these various aspects of externalizing behavior to act independently, but rather to operate on AU and AUPs through a dynamic system of influences, both within and across time. For example, early temperament has been shown to influence later conduct problems, for which there are also known associations with aspects of personality, impulsivity, and sensation seeking. There is little clarity, however, regarding how mechanistic associations between these facets ultimately influence AU and AUPs in adolescence and adulthood. Prior to examining the structural nature of these relationships, we must first establish the factor structures within each of the dimensions, independently. So, for example, ALSPAC has collected information on conduct problems assessed across several points in time, and with multiple instruments (e.g., the Revised Rutter Parent Scale for Preschool Children at 42 months and repeated assessments of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at ages 6.5, 9.5, and 11.5 years). In order to assess development within conduct problems, we must first confirm that the two scales tap into the same underlying construct. Toward this end, one strategy that we propose is to identify a set of ""anchor"" items/behaviors that are assessed within both measures (e.g., is inconsiderate of others, steals, destroys/damages property, fights, bullies, lies/cheats). We can then subject this common set of variables to within-wave confirmatory factor analysis, allowing us to differentiate between items that yield consistent parameter estimates across time (equivalent factor loadings across assessments) and those for which associations with the underlying construct vary across time (i.e., some items may reflect behavior that is more or less indicative of conduct problems at different stages of development). Time-specific factor score estimates (FSEs) can then be derived by specifying a model which equates factor loadings across time for those items displaying factorial invariance, while freely estimating loadings at each wave of assessment for those items displaying developmental inconsistency. Moreover, we propose to implement these procedures across the different dimensions of externalizing behavior that have been conducted in ALSPAC. The resulting FSEs, which capitalize on consistency while also recognizing the potential for specific behaviors to increase/decrease in relevance across development, can then be used as the unit of measurement in models addressing the complex structural relationships between individual dimensions of behavior, general domains of risk, and alcohol-related outcomes. Accordingly, the broad goal of this set of analyses will be to characterize the measurement of, and inter-relationships between, different domains of externalizing behavior that have been assessed in ALSPAC, in order to use this information to study how different facets of externalizing behavior relate to alcohol use. We have previously had a conference call with Barbara Maughan (and Glyn Lewis) and discussed her interesting work on trajectories of conduct problems and externalizing behavior in the ALSPAC sample, so we would plan to work with her (and other interested ALSPAC collaborators) on these efforts, so as to ensure there is no duplication of effort across the projects. Since our primary interest is in understanding how externalizing behavior relates to alcohol use (with the latter being our primary outcome of interest), and her interest is in the nature of externalizing behavior itself (her primary outcome of interest), we believe that our projects will be synergistic rather than overlapping in scope.",null,"Tuesday, 22 September, 2009","Tuesday, 22 September, 2009",Alcohol

Research has established maternal tobacco and alcohol use as having the most profound effect on children and adolescents, although the use of other substances such as cannabis (Fried, 2002) and cocaine has also been studied (Huizink & Mulder, 2006). Up to this point, the focus of research on maternal smoking and drinking during pregnancy has primarily been on externalizing and conduct/behavioral outcomes in the child (Fried et al., 1997; Streissguth et al., 1984; Millberger et al., 1996; Fergusson et al., 1993; Knopik, 2009; Knopik et al., 2005; Wakschlag et al., 1997; Weitzman et al., 1992; Rantakallio et al., 1992), including ADHD (Huizink & Mulder, 2006), oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder (Fergusson et al., 1998), and later substance abuse. However, findings from recent research have suggested a potential relationship between prenatal nicotine and alcohol exposure and internalizing problems caused by disruptions in neurobehavioral and cognitive development, potentially resulting in depression, generalized anxiety, impaired memory function, lower scores on arithmetic tasks (Batstra et al., 2003) deficits in verbal learning (Richardson et al., 2002; Cornelius et al., 2001), auditory, and visual-perceptual processing (Fried, 2002), as well as IQ decrements (Streissguth et al., 1998, 1990) and slower information processing speeds (Huizink & Mulder, 2006). Evidence also indicates that these adverse effects may persist into early and late adolescence (Wakschlag et al., 1997), resulting in subsequent impaired executive functioning (Huizink & Mulder, 2006), increased incidence of substance abuse (particularly smoking) (Ernst et al., 2001) or a predisposition to early onset of smoking in offspring (after intrauterine exposure to heavy smoking) (Huizink & Mulder, 2006; Ernst et al., 2001; Kandler et al., 1994; Cornelius et al., 2000; Buka et al., 2003).

Placental dysfunction increases the risk of pregnancy  loss (stillbirth or miscarriage), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, babies who are born too small or too large, death in the first year of life and cerebral palsy. We do not know how the placenta works. There are methods that can be used on placental tissue (collected after birth) to measure how the placenta works at a molecular level. However, it is not known how well these methods perform in large scale cohort studies like ALSPAC. The advantages of using these methods in cohorts like ALSPAC are that those studies have lots of information on the pregnancy and mother and child's health(which most studies that have used these methods do not). However, it is not easy in cohorts to collect placental tissue with the same rigour that has been used in placental research focused studies. In particular the time between delivery of the placenta and processing is suggested to ideally be 30 minutes, but this is not possible when placenta are being retrieved from hospitals and brought to a University laboratory like BBL. Whether longer time intervals make the measurements unreliable is not known. In this  'proof of concept' grant we will measure placental function at a molecular level by assessing gene expression, DNA methylation, and metabolites in detail using placenta from the ALSPAC-G2 cohort. We will assess how these measures relate to time interval between delivery and initial processing and undertake some preliminary research analyses.",The immediate impact will be related to knowing the reliability of the data we can obtain from placental tissue and being able to use the results from this PoC to support further large scale funding applications (including from collaborators),"Thursday, 30 August, 2018","Tuesday, 4 September, 2018","Epidemiology, Placenta

The survival rates after 5 years of diagnosis is only 50%, even after a gradual improvement over the last 30 years. This indicates a need to try and find effective prevention, diagnosis and treatments for this disease.

One such approach has been to look at commonly used drugs that were not usually considered for cancer use such as aspirin. Aspirin has been shown to be useful for CRC prevention and as an adjuvant to chemotherapy. However, current data suggests that not everyone benefits from aspirin use and this is seen in people who continuously take aspirin but still get colorectal cancer indicating that personalised medicine may be an important aspect of future cancer prevention and treatment.

A summary of the aspirin metabolism pathway has been constructed as well as the metabolites and enzymes involved in the breakdown of aspirin. We have identified candidate SNPs from the GWAS catalogue in the enzymes involved in this pathway and want to verify whether these are associated with levels of different aspirin metabolites.

Further research on mechanisms occurring early in life that underlie the development of both self-harm and eating disorders in adolescence are required to inform potential preventative measures and treatment interventions.

Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are robustly associated with both eating disorders and self-harm and may act as a common risk factor for both. However, not everyone who has a stressful experience in childhood goes on to develop psychopathology, and it is unclear what factors may predispose an individual to develop self-harm or eating disorders following an ACE.","This project will lead to a greater understanding of the processes involved in the development of self-harm and disordered eating in adolescents and young adults.

This manifests as poor chromatic discrimination (Heaton, Ludlow, & Roberson, 2008)(Franklin, Sowden, Burley, Notman, & Alder, 2008)(Franklin et al., 2010) but good colour memory (Heaton et al., 2008). Although originally outlined as test of executive functioning, autistic children, children with autism also show less interference effects for colour naming compared with typically developing children on the classic Stroop test e.g. (Simmons et al., 2009), which is probably related to verbal information processing. Some theories suggest that there is an association between verbal ability and perceptual discrimination (Heaton et al., 2008) such that normally developing children apply verbal labels to colours, and are therefore distracted when presented with colours carrying non-typical labels. Children with language difficulties, as typically expressed in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), however are thought to remember colours perceptionally, in other words they do not encode colour verbally, and may therefore have less interference effects compared to typically developing children (Simmons et al., 2009). A considerable body of research reports that children with autism have also impairments in facial recognition and in the understanding of facial emotional expressions (Simmons et al., 2009). This might be related to the finding that ASD children appear to process and/or attend the eye region of faces less effectively than typically developing children e.g. (Rutherford, Clements, & Sekuler, 2007)(Spezio, Adolphs, Hurley, & Joseph Piven, 2007)(Simmons et al., 2009) and more likely fail to form view-invariant face representations (Wolf et al., 2008). In addition, the ability to perform face-eye region special discriminations might be coupled to verbal intelligence (Rutherford et al., 2007). Furthermore, several studies have observed an enhanced ability to perform visual search tasks in autistic patients such as the ability to disembed a target figures from a complex background in the ""Embedded Figures Test"". Likewise, autistic children show an superior performance in perceptional grouping as well as mental rotation tasks (e.g. Block-Design subtest of the WISC-III; (Shah & Frith, 1993)(Venter, Lord, & Schopler, 1992)(Goldstein, Beers, Siegel, & Minshew, 2001).

Prof Abdullah A Mamun, Dr. Kim Betts",Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and mental and behavioural disorders in offspring,"There has been increasing research attention to the impact of in utero exposures to specific perinatal risk factors and their potential impact on diseases later in life. One of these is hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), a perinatal condition which affects up to 10% of pregnancies globally. Current evidence shows that HDP are associated with an increased risk of offspring cardiovascular, immune, metabolic disorders in later life. HDP are also responsible for various adverse perinatal outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight and intrauterine growth restriction, which are known risk factors for numerous mental health morbidities. In addition, HDP may also affect brain development via utero-placental vascular insufficiency and fetal malnutrition and lead to subsequent neurobehavioral difficulties.  A lot of research has been conducted on the associations between HDP and cognitive functioning in offspring, however, evidence on the effect of intrauterine exposure to HDP on offspring mental and behavioural disorders is not well-established.

Two systematic reviews conducted by this team, one currently under review and the other one accepted by the British Journal of Psychiatry have shown that HDP had a negative impact for a range mental or behavioural disorders. Our finding showed that preeclampsia was associated with increased risk of offspring schizophrenia. The risk of Autism spectrum disorder was also 32% higher in offspring who had intrauterine exposure to preeclampsia as compared to those non-exposed. However, we found inconclusive finding on the effect of HDP and other mental and behavioural disorders, suggesting the need of further studies to progress this area of research. Following on from these findings, this PhD project aims to add to the existing evidence in a meaningful way by conducting a high quality, large sample, birth cohort study.","This research has a potential to provide accurate information on whether there is a direct link between HDP and a range of mental and behavioural disorders in offspring. This will have potential benefits in terms of advancing the existing knowledge and help clinical decision making for interventions during pregnancy, thereby improving near and long term offspring mental health outcomes.","Wednesday, 29 November, 2017",null,"Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Statistical methods, Epidemiology, Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, mental disorders, behavioural disorders, offspring"

The commissioning of this research follows two recent literature reviews (Staley 2009; Brett et al. 2010) which demonstrates gaps in the evidence base for the impact of public involvement in research. The aim of this project is to assess the impact of public involvement in research through a 'realist evaluation' (Pawson & Tilley 2008) which emphasises the importance of hypothesising regularities of context, mechanism and outcome (CMO). We will examine the implementation of public involvement by asking what context factors (e.g. institutional support) enable which mechanisms (e.g. training) to lead to what outcomes (e.g. improved research design). We will then compare CMO regularities in eight case studies with a diverse range of research projects (e.g. different research subjects, methods, stages of the research process, scale of the research, approaches to involvement). The Research will be undertaken by academic researchers from the University of the West of England and Coventry University in partnership with members of the public working as 'research partners'. Each case study will be undertaken jointly by an academic researcher and a research partner.

This is more likely for those who have had symptoms of anxiety or depression during their teenage years. A common form of support for anxiety or depression at this age is through the GP - who might offer either psychological therapy (like counselling sessions, or cognitive behavioural therapy), or drug treatment (such as anti-depressants), to try to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms. This might also reduce likelihood of intimate partner violence later on, but there so far this has not been studied.","Recent qualitative interviews with young survivors of IPVA, aged 18-25, found that the large majority had experienced mental health problems such as anxiety or depressive symptoms since adolescence, and though almost all received some form of referral, they also perceived access to or the form of support as either insufficient or inconsistent. Findings should go some way to addressing the uncertainty around mechanisms and the potential impact of mental health and other services on service users.

In other disorders, such as schizophrenia, there is an earlier age of onset and worse prognosis for men (Ober et al, 2008). The Y chromosome is potentially an important influence on male susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. Animal models have indicated a role for Y chromosome in aggression and impaired parental behaviour (Gatewood et al, 2006). However, due to difficulties arising from the lack of recombination, the Y chromosome has been largely excluded from genetic studies of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the Y chromosome has been investigated in relation to autistic traits (Jamain et al, 2002) and aggression (Shah et al, 2009) in humans, these studies have not used Y chromosome haplogroups appropriately.

This presents a significant problem as there are a range of chronic conditions that require ongoing treatment, such as epilepsy, hypertension, auto-immune disorders or psychiatric disorders that may precede or develop during the pregnancy. This can mean women are deprived of medication due to clinical reservations  or are prescribed medications that cause potential harm to the offspring. Given the inability to perform RCTs, the harmonisation of pharmacoepidemiological and genetic data is an alternative way to evaluate the potential risks currently associated with continuing medications to provide reliable information for clinicians and patients.

SubstanceIllicit substance use of  drugs use is taken to be illegal substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and synthetic stimulants . Use of these illegal substances is associated with an increased risks of addiction, overdose and long-term health effects, and therefore presents a significant public health concern. The link between substance use and poor mental health, educational attainment and subsequent employment is well documented [3]. Harms may be increased if use is during adolescence, a period of development is characterised by extensive cognitive and emotional development, which can be inhibited by substance use, and have a negative impact of future life outcomes [1]. A recent study suggested that in terms of brain development, adolescence should be considered up to age 25 [2]. Focussing on adolescence is important, as this is when most people start engaging in substance use, and therefore this period of life is important for the timing of preventative interventions [4]. Of interest is the substance use that persists throughout adolescence and into adulthood, which could progress to dependent use and be damaging to health.

However, there is marked global variation in prevalence of use of these substances, which indicates that contextual and individual factors influence this behaviour. As Mmuch of this data comes from self-reported questionnaires, and aspects of data collection may also affect differences in prevalence of reported use. Substance use is taken to be illegal substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and synthetic stimulants. Use of these illegal substances is associated with an increased risk of addiction, overdose and long-term health effects, and therefore presents a significant public health concern. Of interest is the substance use that persists throughout adolescence and into adulthood, which could progress to dependent use and be damaging to health. This period of adolescence is characterised by extensive cognitive and emotional development, which can be inhibited by substance use, and have a negative impact of future life outcomes [1]. A recent study suggested that in terms of brain development, adolescence should be considered up to age 25 [2]. The link between substance use and poor mental health, educational attainment and subsequent employment is well documented [3]. However, it is less clear why geographical variations in substance use occur, and the factors that predict drug use during young adulthood. Focussing on young adulthood is important as this is when most people start engaging in substance use, and therefore this period of life is important for the timing of preventative interventions [4]. To fully characterise the problem of substance use in this age group, more work is needed to understand the extent of substance use and identify risk factors that predict drug use.",,"Tuesday, 9 April, 2019","Thursday, 18 April, 2019","Epidemiology, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Statistical methods, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics"

Worldwide, the rise in the prevalence of these diseases cannot be explained by genetics only. These multifactorial diseases are associated with individual, lifestyle-related behaviours and environmental factors.

Physical activity is a modifiable lifestyle-related behaviour of particular interest that could limit the global burden of respiratory diseases. Physical activity has decreased over the past few decades, and time spent in sedentary behaviours has become more common, especially in children. The World Health Organization recommends that children and youth should do at least 60 minutes or more of physical activity daily (including vigorous-intensity physical activities at least three times a week). More than half of European children and 80.3% adolescents worldwide failed to achieve these recommendations.

While there is evidence that children need to be active to promote their healthy growth, and development (e.g. preventing obesity), few studies have examined the association between physical activity and respiratory health, in particular lung function growth, and results are inconsistent. The mixed results may be explained by different study populations, heterogeneity in approaches for assessing physical activity (questionnaire, accelerometer), insufficient (or inconsistent) adjustment for potential confounders (social, biological, behavioural, and environmental factors). Moreover, prospective studies that do exist generally lack repeated measures of physical activity and lung function.

Within the literature there are several schools of thought for the causal inference between substance use and education variables. These are a direct cause between substance abuse and education, either as the use of substances effects education or that academic underachievers are more likely to use substances15. The other school of thought is that there is an indirect cause, perhaps academic underachievement and substance abuse is a common syndrome of problem behaviours4. The main problem the literature has with defining causal inferences between substances and academics is the problems with uncontrolled confounding1.

This paradigm translates directly to public health messages aimed at persuading individuals to make small lifestyle changes in order to prevent obesity (""eat a little less, do a little more"")1.

In spite of this, rates of smoking (even during pregnancy) remain high, typically above 10% in most countries. This rate is even higher among certain subgroups of the population, and appears to be increasing in low and middle-income countries.

Smoking status is therefore of great importance in most epidemiological studies. Although questionnaires are the simplest and least invasive way to interrogate smoking status, the result is often unreliable and may be biased, particularly if based on self-report during pregnancy. Furthermore, questions about the number of cigarettes smoked may not capture exposure differences resulting from personal variation related to cigarette brands, smoking patterns such as depth of inhalation, metabolism rates and exposure to second-hand smoke.

Serum cotinine, a metabolite of cigarette smoke, can be measured but is limited by its short biological half-life of 17 hours for the average person. This half-life is even shorter (8 hours) for pregnant women, due to markedly accelerated metabolic clearance of cotinine during pregnancy. Cotinine measurements taken after even a single day of smoking cessation could result in false negatives. It certainly could not be used to estimate smoking intensity or pack-years.

DNA methylation, by contrast, appears to provide reliable and long-term biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure. In fact, it is possible to use linear combinations of methylation levels at smoking-associated CpG sites to not only differentiate among current, former and never smokers but to also detect smoking intensity and number of smoking years.

We will use ARIES DNA methylation data to develop predictors of smoking behaviour which we will then test by comparing against self-reported smoking behaviour from questionnaires and ALSPAC cotinine data.

It is unclear if lighter and more sporadic MJ exposure (i.e. recreational MJ use), a pattern more typical of most adolescent users, has similar deleterious effects especially when more potent forms of MJ have become the norm during the past 2 decades. In a recently completed 3-year longitudinal study, we found that unaffected adolescent first-degree biological relatives of schizophrenia patients with recreational MJ use failed to show age-expected maturation in processing speed and executive functioning and in pruning of gray matter cortical thickness within dorsolateral prefrontal and parieto-temporal brain regions. The overall objective of this ALSPAC proposal are to understand the nature of the association between adolescent recreational MJ use and schizophrenia susceptibility. The specific aims are to delineate the impact of adolescent recreational MJ use on cognitive maturation, brain cortical development and its specificity on risks for developing schizophrenia and other common psychiatric disorders in later life.","If exposure to low levels of high potency forms of marijuana during adolescence heightens the risk for schizophrenia later in life, such a finding will have important public health implications. Counseling adolescents against heavy adolescent marijuana use may no longer be sufficient if recreational use is no longer “safe”. New public health policies to reduce marijuana use among adolescents may therefore be necessary. Reduced adolescent exposure to high potency MJ may also lead to lower SZ incidence. Another likely impact of this research is advancing understanding regarding the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie how adolescent marijuana use may increase susceptibility for schizophrenia through disruptions in adolescent brain maturation. Such novel findings from this proposal will bolster vital foundational knowledge for the development of new therapeutic measures to help reduce the severe disease burden of schizophrenia.","Wednesday, 20 November, 2019","Friday, 22 November, 2019","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Mental health, Cognitive assessments, questionnaires, brain MRI scans, data linkage to healthcare records of psychiatric diagnoses, Cognition - cognitive function, Development"

Mounting concern about the potentially toxic effects of anaesthetic drugs on the young brain has led to 76 studies since 1990 which have attempted to measure the brain development and functioning of humans who were given general anaesthetics for surgery or procedures in early childhood. Aspects of brain development which have been examined include measures of intelligence, movement and co-ordination, behaviour, language and speech, literacy and numeracy. Other measures have included academic achievement in school and diagnoses of learning disability, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Unfortunately, these human studies are frequently of limited quality, with: too few children (on average 130 cases), no method to account for other causes of adverse brain development which could bias the results, no information on the duration and type of general anaesthetic drugs given and not specifically designed to assess children's brain development. Their results are conflicting and somewhat difficult to interpret. At present, it remains uncertain whether anaesthetic drugs are harming young childrens' brains. The definitive results of a single clinical trial specifically designed to address this important question are not due for several years. In the meantime, the number of published review articles, commentaries, consensus statements and statements by regulatory bodies continues to grow. The United States Food and Drug Association  urges careful consideration of the risks and benefits of a general anaesthetic in young children and pregnant women undergoing anaesthesia which may last longer than three hours or require multiple procedures.","The outcome of our study, whether positive or negative, will be of significant international interest to the anaesthesia and child health communities and as such will be disseminated through publication and presentation on an international stage. The study will add a large, high quality finding to the building body of evidence into the neurotoxic effects of anaesthetic drugs in children. This work is timely and is likely to inform an escalating number of reviews and commentaries in the literature, as well as recommendations by clinical and regulatory bodies.","Sunday, 29 April, 2018","Tuesday, 1 May, 2018","Paediatric anaesthesia, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Developmental disorders - autism, Cognitive impairment, Learning difficulty, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Speech/language problem, Computer simulations/modelling/algorithms, Statistical methods, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Communication (including non-verbal), Development, Intelligence - memory, Speech and language, Neurotoxicity, anaesthesia, paediatric anaesthesia, paediatric surgery"

At the same time, an increasing gender gap in education has developed in favour of women (OECD, 2015). The gender gap in education now represents a societal challenge in many industrialised countries. The causes are not known and under-researched, and there has been limited attention to potential policies for decreasing the gap.

Girls enter puberty earlier than boys, and by age 15 to 16 the gender difference in maturity reaches a peak (Mustanski et al, 2004). At this age, adolescents graduate from lower secondary education and in many European countries (including the UK and in the Nordic region), it coincides with important decisions regarding their future. The opportunities available to individuals depend heavily on their grade scores from lower secondary school. An important question to ask is therefore whether and to what extent the âbiological head startâ of girls explains their educational outperformance of boys.","A better understanding of the relationship between pubertal development and academic achievement is likely to be of importance for policymakers in both the education and health sectors. In terms of the education system, the insight will inform debates about the optimal age for testing and tracking of students, and measures that could possibly improve the performance of boys and other disadvantaged groups.

As suggested by the ""Barker"" hypothesis this mechanism might prepare the foetus for optimal functioning in the specific environment. Maternal nutrition is particularly relevant in affecting methylation. Animal studies have highlighted epigenetic changes following under-nutrition or altered dietary intake. Dietary manipulation of pregnant female rodents alters coat colour phenotype and is associated with epigenetic modifications in the agouti gene . Folate and choline deficiencies in maternal diet in rodents have also been shown to be associated with altered methylation patterns , . Maternal exposure to a high-fat diet in mice has been associated with increased body length and higher insulin sensitivity and it has been suggested this effect might too be mediated via epigenetic changes .In humans, studies on the effects of the Dutch Famine have found specific methylation (either hypo- or hyper-) patterns of different genes following peri-conceptional exposure to famine (but not exposure later in gestation). Maternal stress in utero can also affect methylation patterns, and epigenetic mechanisms have been suggested as mediators of the transgenerational effect of stress in animal models .",null,"Thursday, 24 November, 2011","Thursday, 24 November, 2011","Eating Disorder, Epigenetics"

It plays multiple key roles in human biology, acting for example as a mechanism for allowing cells to differentiate into specific types (e.g. skin cells) and to maintain their differentiated identities. It was recently discovered that DNA methylation patterns in the genome change with age and can be used to accurately estimate the age of a person. Although many studies have investigated these estimates in great detail, particularly the cases where there is a discrepancy between actual and estimated age, few studies have more broadly considered the ways that DNA methylation changes throughout the lifecourse and how those changes relate to development and aging. The few that have either consider only aging in adulthood or short periods such as puberty in childhood. We propose to comprehensively investigate DNA methylation change from birth to adolescence using DNA methylation profiles from ALSPAC measured at birth, age 7y and age 15-17y (as part of ARIES: Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies) and from the  Generation R cohort study in Rotterdam (http://www.generationr.nl/) measured at birth, age 6y and age 9y.

The prevalence varies within populations, sex, dentitions and tooth-type. The prevalence in Europe is approximately 5%. Excluding third molars, mandibular second premolars and maxillary lateral incisors are most likely to be absent, with a prevalence of 2.5-4% and 2% respectively. The aetiology of hypodontia is multifactorial. Genetic syndromes found to be associated with hypodontia include ectodermal dysplasia, Downâs syndrome and cleft lip/palate. Examples of environmental factors are early childhood trauma to the alveolar process, and chemotherapy and radiotherapy in infancy. Intrauterine exposure of toxins, such as thalidomide, and maternal infections, rubella. Currently, there is limited research on maternal smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption during pregnancy and its effect on hypodontia. The only study to investigate this was a case-control study in New Zealand with 89 patients. It found strong evidence that consumption of 10 or more cigarettes per day during pregnancy was associated with greater odds of the child having hypodontia (adjusted OR, 4.18; 95% CI, 1.48-11.8; P=0.007) . The conclusion from the paper is vague regarding mechanisms but suggests that oxidative stress from smoking affects foetal neural crest cells, which could explain the causal relationship between smoking and hypodontia.  This interesting finding requires replication with a larger sample size, ideally using methods to pinpoint specific intrauterine effects. ALSPAC provides an opportunity to replicate this and use paternal smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption as negative controls for the causal relationship between hypodontia and maternal smoking during pregnancy.",null,"Wednesday, 8 November, 2017","Tuesday, 5 December, 2017","Dentistry, Hypodontia- congenitally missing teeth, Statistical methods, Dental"

However, this breadth of data creates a risk of fragmentation, inconsistent structure and access processes, severely limiting utility, timeliness and impact.

Our vision is to transform UK COVID-19 diagnostic datasets to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) and couple this with expert data engineering, enabled by Health Data Research (HDR) UK, to catalyse responsible and trustworthy use of the data for research and innovation.

We propose to support PIs and data custodians to link COVID-19 cohort, serology and other health and non-health datasets. This longitudinal linkage is vital to derive new scientific insights and deliver informed decisions about how best to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. At present there are >30 independent studies with no streamlined approach to linkage to other health and non-health related datasets, lack of data standardisation, and no strategic approach to synthesise analyses across studies.

SAGE (9th June) requested HDR to work with partners to develop the UK-wide serology and testing data research asset that is linkable to other data sources.

This proposal has been prepared in response to this request. We have bought together 41 leaders from 29 different organisations and 44 data sources to address a major data engineering challenge by building upon existing UKRI investments, including the HDR BREATHE Hub, to create a ‘one-stop’ service for trustworthy, multi-stakeholder utilisation of curated COVID-19 data for public, private and third sector benefit.","Importance: The UK has >30 relevant research funded datasets (Table 1). Currently, these are held by multiple data controllers with different governance models. A key ambition is the standardised capture of granular data within NHS laboratory systems, permitting uniform analysis that adds value. Common data asset structures are vital if we are to deliver maximum research and innovation potency.
Deliverables: We will deliver four new capabilities: (i) a platform for discoverability and feasibility analyses to understand if the required data and/or populations can answer research questions; (ii) the ability for researchers to perform meta-analysis and exploratory analysis UK-wide; (iii) the ability to link COVID-19 UK cohorts to multi- dimensional health and non-health related datasets UK-wide; (iv) development of the robust UK health data infrastructure to enable long-term impact beyond COVID-19.
Expertise: We have brought together the PIs of research cohorts, NHS system leaders in diagnostic testing. the expertise and infrastructure of the HDR BREATHE Hub (Director Sheikh) and the HDR Gateway, the scalable global software of BC Platforms, the UKCRC Tissue Directory (200 tissue banks) and the four NHS national trusted research environments (TREs).
Resources: We will develop the ability to discover, request access and analyse data from 44 data sources through: (i) improving access to new serology cohorts, including SIREN; (ii) existing cohorts that have been augmented with serology and other COVID-19 related data; and, (iii) NHS serology resources, to drive new insights into COVID-19.

The development of ADHD (symptoms) is partially genetic, and can also be influenced by factors in someone’s surrounding, for example prenatal nicotine exposure. Genetics and surrounding factors can interplay and this can be reflected in DNA methylation. Knowing which DNA methylation patterns are associated with ADHD symptoms, can teach us more about the molecular mechanisms underlying ADHD (symptoms). These DNA methylation profiles are cell type-specific. Up to now, most methylome-wide association studies have been performed in whole blood, in which multiple blood cells are present. Because the different blood cells have distinct DNA methylation profiles, it is possible that meaningful signal is cancelled out in whole blood measures. Therefore, we think there might be valuable signal in cell type-specific DNA methylation, done by a statistical method called epigenomic deconvolution. This could give us more insight in the molecular mechanisms of ADHD symptoms.","We hope to find robust and specific DNA methylation associations to ADHD symptoms, in the different domains in a cell type-specific manner.

Availability of clinical and genetic screening will pave way to early diagnosis and more holistic treatment approaches to improve health and quality of life in these patients.","The research is aimed for identifying the genetic basis of a common heritable connective tissue disorder (hEDS). The impact of knowing a genetic cause to a heritable disease has huge scope in diagnostic, prognostic and management strategies. This will help in establishing a genetic testing service for hEDS patients. Providing a definite diagnosis to a category of patients hitherto either often categorized as unexplained medical disorders will be a major step in legitimizing their complaints, leading to earlier diagnosis and better management strategies leading to improved patient outcomes and quality of life and health care savings for the NHS.","Monday, 12 November, 2018","Tuesday, 13 November, 2018","Molecular genetics and genomics, Congenital abnormalities, Gastrointestinal, GWAS, Microarrays, Epigenetics, Genetics, Genomics, Genome wide association study, Whole genome sequencing"

Second, we aim to integrate these association results with genome-wide expression data to identify a set of candidate genes having associated genetic and/or epigenetic variants and showing altered expression as related to food sensitization.

For many of these lifestyle factors there are currently no methods to accurately measure the accumulation of these exposures over an individual’s lifetime. We believe that we have identified a method to accurately measure accumulated exposures in a blood sample, to quantify breast cancer risk associated with these exposures over their lifetime. We will start by developing a molecular measure of hormonal oestrogen exposures based on DNA methylation data from 2500 women from several international cohorts and including nested breast cancer case control studies. We hope to validate this measure of cumulative oestrogen exposure associated with DNA methylation in additional cohort studies such as ALSPAC. We will validate these measurements associated with cumulative oestrogen exposure in blood samples from 1200 women using an alternative methodology. We will also investigate how other lifestyle factors, which are known breast cancer risk factors, might influence this oestrogen exposure measurement.

Most research has identified fetal development as a sensitive period for this transmission of stress from mother to child, with considerably less research on the postnatal period. Maternal postnatal stress has been found to shape infant stress response development, potentially creating a pathway by which maternal stress can become embodied in the next generation and influence how the next generation responds to and handles stressors. However, it is not clear how these effects on the stress response become embodied and whether these changes persist through childhood.

However while biological, epidemiological and quantitative social science approaches are often used, incorporating lived social realities into a âlife course approachâ remains a neglected, yet vital resource for increasing knowledge about how health is shaped by biosocial processes. This 12 month pilot study  will work with two high profile regional birth cohort studies in the UK and Brazil (ALSPAC and the Pelotas Birth Cohort) to explore how one in-depth method, ethnography, can be used to provide a richer understanding of social realities in life course approaches. It will focus on how ethnography can be used to examine a particular period in the life course, âmotherhoodâ and experiences of social adversity among birth cohort participants.  Contributing innovatively to the development of a âmixed methodâ approach the pilot study will be a first step in making ethnography an essential tool in biosocial life course research by widening a discussion between disciplines about how  understanding lived social realities and experiences can be more productively linked to biology or epidemiology.","Outputs from the pilot study will include (a) free to download report from the final workshop including best practice suggestions for increasing the use of ethnography in longitudinal cohort studies (b) an article in Social Science and Medicine presenting the findings and discussing the theoretical/methodological opportunities in using  ethnography  in longitudinal birth cohort studies and developing ‘mixed methods’ approaches.

The pilot study will lay the foundation for a larger comparative and cross disciplinary research initiative to further explore how the tool of ethnography can better integrated into life course approaches. 

The PI currently works with others developing ethnographic expertise with and/or about birth cohorts. This includes Liz Roberts (University of Michigan) who is combining ethnography with a birth cohort methodology; a planned workshop at the Brocher Foundation 2019 and a panel at the American Anthropological Association in 2018 on birth cohorts as a ‘technology’ of biosocial research.  As the programme director of the MSc Biosocial Medical Anthropology, starting at UCL in 2018, and a board member of the ESRC ‘Socio-B’ DTC at UCL the PI is ideally placed to develop this project and a vision for more fully incorporating ethnographic research as part of a biosocial approach to the life course and longitudinal cohort studies.  Students from both these programmes will be encouraged (as part of their dissertation and project work) to participate in data analysis  and planned future research.","Tuesday, 24 April, 2018","Wednesday, 25 April, 2018","Anthropology, Qualitative study, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics"

Joint hypermobility is a widespread, poorly recognized, connective tissue condition that affects about 20% of the population.  There is growing evidence linking joint hypermobility with problems not just related to bones and muscles (e.g asthma, migraine, dyspraxia).  Individuals with hypermobility are (up to 16 times) overrepresented among those with panic or anxiety disorders.  Hypermobility is also linked to stress-sensitive medical disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue.  We have shown that healthy people with hypermobile joints have structural differences in key emotion processing regions in the brain including an area called the amygdala (this is involved in the processing of fear).   Although there is considerable evidence to support the link between joint hypermobility and anxiety relatively little is known about how joint hypermobility is related to other psychiatric disorders and stress sensitive symptoms in large population data sets and especially in children and adolescents.

Life history strategies are defined by key decisions that trade off finite resources against competing demands to achieve reproductive goals. Both across and within species, the trade-off between the allocation of resources to growth and to reproductive efforts results in organisms employing varying strategies that can be characterised, loosely, as ‘slow’ or ‘fast’. A ‘slow’ life history strategy is characterized by later maturity and proportionally greater investment of resources in a smaller number of offspring. In contrast, a ‘fast’ life history strategy involves more effort directed towards reproduction, such as earlier puberty and sexual activity.

Long-term drug users often have problems with social cognition. Users of cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs have difficulties recognising others’ emotional expressions, and have difficulty understanding with Theory of Mind. However, it’s not clear if using drugs results in these problems, or if people who have poor social cognition to begin with are more prone to use drugs. For example, people with poor social cognition may use drugs to improve their interactions with others. The use of drugs to help with a psychological problem is known as ‘self-medication’, and there is some evidence for this. For example, heavy smokers only seem to have difficulty with social cognition when they stop smoking. Additionally, many individuals’ suffering from mental health problems believe that their drug use helps to alleviate their symptoms (for example, by reducing their anxiety). Many mental health disorders also include problems with social cognition and are linked to high rates of drug dependence. For this reason, we previously studied the relationship of poor social cognition in childhood (age 7) with teenage drug use (age 17). Interestingly, we found that poor social cognition in childhood (particularly recognising emotional expression) was related to decreased teenage drug use. The current study aims to explore the relationship between childhood mental health problems (age 7) and teenage drug use (age 17). By examining childhood mental health problems separately from social cognition, we can explore if these two are related to teenage drug use in similar or different ways. Our results may be useful for identification of targets for early intervention.",null,"Tuesday, 2 February, 2016","Wednesday, 9 March, 2016","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Statistical methods, Birth outcomes, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Psychology - personality, substance use"

Not all individuals with ADHD have the same profile of problems and long term outcome. For example, some have additional problems such as antisocial behaviour, autistic traits and anxiety or depression. Some individuals grow out of their ADHD, whilst others continue to have problems in adolescence and adulthood. Identifying those individuals who have additional problems is important for monitoring and potential intervention. Sleep problems are known to be common in children with ADHD traits and diagnoses and can be especially impairing for individuals and their families. Whilst there is some evidence to suggest that sleep problems are associated with increased risk of additional problems in ADHD, much more work is needed to understand the relationship between sleep problems and these problems, especially as children grow into adolescence.

However, the risks are heterogeneous, with some obese pregnancies leading to preterm birth and reduced fetal growth, and others complicated by high birth weight. Some women who are obese may alternatively have uncomplicated, healthy pregnancies. There is an urgent need to identify those women and babies most at risk of specific outcomes and thus better target healthcare management and interventions. To do this, we first need to better understand the mechanisms underlying how maternal risk factors combine with the fetal response to influence risk. To date, our work using ALSPAC (project B2388) and other studies has identified genetic variation in both mother and baby that is associated with birth weight. We have used these genetic variants to investigate causal associations between maternal modifiable risk factors (e.g. blood pressure, glucose levels) and birth weight of the baby. However, many questions remain unanswered, including whether maternal blood pressure or glucose also influence the timing of birth, the weight of the placenta and the levels of insulin (a key growth factor) produced by the fetus. In addition, the role of the fetal response to the maternal environment is not well defined, and it is not known whether this fetal response influences maternal metabolism.

While many aspects of depression trajectories from adolescence to adulthood are well understood, depression is still among the most unreliable diagnoses of all categorical mental disorders. Additionally, changes in symptom levels across adolescence and young adulthood are as yet poorly understood. This may result from nosological conceptualizations of mental disorders that do not vary for children as compared to adolescents or adults. Only the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders describes irritability rather than depressed mood as an additional core symptom for children and adolescents. In this vein, researchers and practitioners often apply sum score models that reflect these considerations. However, these models rely on strong assumptions and we therefore aim to use Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children data to investigate depressive symptoms in more depth.","This research will provide new insights into the course of depressive symptoms during adolescenc, providing useful information for both clinical research and practice about how the reporting of symptoms and their developments change, or not, over time.

Recently, this concern has been sharpened with a UNICEF 'report card' ranking the UK in the bottom-third for child well-being (United Nations Children's Fund, 2007). The Government's recent agenda reflects this concern, with the Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme of reforms placing a duty on local authorities and key partners to cooperate in order to improve the well-being of children. More information, however, concerning the factors mediating the development of wider well-being in young people is needed. This project proposes to provide an initial investigation into the development of wider well-being in young people through the childhood life course from infancy, through middle childhood to early adolescence. The maturation of the ALSPAC dataset, making available longitudinal detail of psychological and behavioural trajectories of children from birth to 14, offers the opportunity to study a broader spectrum of childhood life course well-being while taking into account socio-economic background, aspects of parenting and the home environment, and the school through a number of developmental dimensions.   This work will first attempt to develop indices of well being based primarily on the Development and Well-being Assessment (DAWBA) from 8 and 14 years combining these with other measures collected from parent report, child report and clinical assessments. The indices will consist of separate dimensions of well being: emotional, social, behaviour, and school. For example, for the emotional component, scores will be used for DAWBA Particular Fears, Separation Anxiety 8 to 14, the parent report of Mood and Feelings questionnaire from 8 to 14, as well as items of Strength and Difficulties over the same period. The component for social competences is expected to include DAWBA Social Fears 8 to 14, Skuse Social Cognition 7, 11 and 14, Peer Relations 8 to 14, Bullying and Victimisation age 8 and 11. Measures for earlier childhood will be mapped onto these component areas.  The second step in this study will involve modelling predictors of these component scores. This is intended to simultaneously control and test for the relative contribution of factors established in the literature that determine well-being from childhood to early adolescence. We will first examine how children's earlier components of well-being predict their later well-being. This stems from our earlier research (Gutman and Brown, 2008) indicating that children's social competence at age 4 predicted their later involvement in bullying and/or victimisation. We wish to expand this previous research by examining the processes that may mediate the relationship between earlier and later well-being, particularly in the social realm. Previous research suggests that children who have more social difficulties also have lower emotional well-being, which, in turn may contribute to greater problems with their peers and in school (Gutman and Brown, 2008; Gutman and Feinstein, 2008). We expect, therefore, that emotional well-being may mediate the relationship between social competence in early childhood and later social competence in primary school.   We are also interested in the role of parenting behaviours in this process. Waylen (2008) found that health changes in ALSPAC affected parents' feelings and attitudes regarding their children and child rearing at 61 months, but socio-economic status was not an influence. Our recent work (Gutman and Brown, in progress) shows that parents' feelings and attitudes used by Waylen (2008) were one of the leading predictors of quality of parent-child interaction at 61 months (Thorpe) in addition to breast feeding and parental social competence. We are interested in testing a model wherein parental health predicts parents' feelings and attitudes, which, in turn, influences parenting and lastly predicts later child well-being, controlling for earlier well-being.   We are also interested in examining whether specific developmental periods are more important in determining well-being than others. We expect, for example, that well-being is particularly vulnerable during the transition from primary to secondary school. Protective factors, such as teacher and friend support, may buffer the impact of such transition. We expect, therefore, that those pupils who have better relationships with their peers and teachers may experience fewer negative changes in their well-being during such transitions than other pupils.   Lastly, we are interested in how such pathways may be moderated by gender and socioeconomic status. Our research has found that low socioeconomic boys are more likely to experience a trajectory of low and declining well-being compared to other primary school children (Gutman and Feinstein, 2008). Boys are also more likely to engage in bullying behaviours (Gutman and Brown, 2008). Therefore, we might expect that earlier factors such as child social competence are more important for boys than for girls in determining later well-being.    This proposal mirrors elements of the ESRC large grant on adolescent development especially the components led by Anna Vignoles and Paul Greg on peer effects and socio-economic impacts. This study complements the larger studies by offering an initial examination of the predictors influencing the developmental trajectory from childhood to early adolescence. This study will be carried out in 6 months and therefore only offer baseline findings to will inform the larger scale investigations. Owing to the different time constraints and different client readership, the methodologies of this proposed study are very different from the exhaustive approach possible in the ESRC study. This proposal therefore aims to control for the primary background factors using regression analyses rather than refine large models using advanced statistical techniques. Our study offers a further benefit from a more constrained study to identify the main effects with publication in a shorter time frame, by spring 2009. Additionally, the DCSF have expressed great interest in less methodological-based description of the main findings of well being trajectories from childhood to adolescence in a format appropriate for a non-specialist policy-based readership and feel that it would make a significant contribution to the development of debate on how the state my intervene most effectively to improve life chances.",null,"Tuesday, 14 October, 2008","Tuesday, 14 October, 2008",Mental Health

Identifying risk factors that influence adolescent alcohol use is important to appropriately target prevention programs. One area of research that has received considerable attention is the role cognitive functioning (e.g., working memory and inhibition) play as risk for involvement in adolescent alcohol use. There is also a large literature showing a relationship between substance use and self-harm. It is possible that alcohol may increase the risk of self-harm by lowering inhibitions and impairing working memory, which is central to decision making. There is also evidence to suggest that there may be a bi-directional relationship, as several longitudinal studies have reported an association between adolescent self-harm and alcohol problems in adulthood. Although previous prospective studies have examined this association, they are often limited by the use of small sample size, different alcohol use phenotype (i.e. bingeing vs frequency), different follow-up periods, or lack of control for relevant confounders.",This research project has the potential to inform the development of cognitive training as intervention/prevention strategies aimed at reducing alcohol initiation and self-harm.,"Wednesday, 8 January, 2020","Friday, 10 January, 2020","Epidemiology, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Cognitive impairment, Mental health, Statistical methods, Cognition - cognitive function, Statistical methods, Alcohol use, self-harm"

There is sparse epidemiological evidence that early life events, including antenatal influences on lung growth, program a child to be at increased risk for future COPD.COPD may not only have its origins, but also its first symptoms in early childhood. In a report based on the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study, Martinez et al. proposed three patterns of wheezing during the first six years of life, i.e. transient early wheezing in the first three years of life, non-atopic wheezing in preschool years and IgE-mediated wheeze or asthma. Children with transient early wheezing who do not develop asthma, usually wheeze in the first years in response to environmental exposures such as maternal smoking or viral infections. We put forward the hypothesis that these symptoms constitute the first signs of disturbed early lung development and lung growth and as a corollary hypothesis that this may reflect later development of COPD. This is supported by the replicated findings that transient early wheeze is associated with lower lung function levels up to age 16, even when the symptoms of wheeze have disappeared. Since the level of lung function, expressed as FEV1, has been shown to track over time, it is plausible that infants with lower lung function levels have an increased risk to develop COPD later in life. A limiting factor in research on this hypothesis is the huge logistic difficulty of studying the effect of early life events with respect to a disorder that only becomes apparent 50-60 years later. Therefore research must rely on indirect evidence and one such a feasible type of research is the investigation of common underlying genes.  The aim of our study is to investigate whether replicated genes of COPD are associated with transient early wheeze and the level of lung function in children. The current birth cohorts under study (PIAMA and KOALA) allow us to analyze data from 2500 children and take into account important environmental stimuli like in utero and early childhood smoke exposure and air pollution. Moreover, a birth cohort in England will provide data to replicate our positive findings.There is increasing evidence from studies in adults that genes involved in the response to oxidative stress are associated with COPD development. The strongest and most consistent effects on COPD have been found in the genes of glutamate-cysteine ligases (GCL), glutathione S-tranferases M1 (GSTM1) and P1 (GSTP1), and superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3). Other replicated genes of COPD are involved in the balance between proteases and antiproteases in the lungs, such as alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AAT), Tissue Inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP)-1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and Serpine2. In addition, we aim to use the positive findings of a currently performed genome wide association study (GWA) on COPD in adults (COPACETIC). This allows us to verify if genes that are found by GWA in a COPD cohort and replicated in other cohorts of adults are also associated with low lung function and wheezing phenotypes in childhood.This study aims to provide more insight in the natural history and pathogenesis of COPD. In addition, it may offer opportunities to identify susceptible individuals at the earliest stages of the disease, when preventive strategies are most effective.",null,"Tuesday, 27 January, 2009","Tuesday, 27 January, 2009",Cardiovascular

One such pre-existing phenotype is low Level of Response (LR) to alcohol, where individuals who require higher doses of alcohol to achieve an effect are more likely to develop AUDs than those who react more intensely to ethanol. This trait can be measured as less alcohol-related change in positive (e.g., feeling high) and negative (e.g., feeling dizzy) subjective feelings of intoxication, hormones, and EEG measures at a given blood alcohol concentration (BAC), or as less effect per drink on a retrospective questionnaire. Low LR is seen in ~40% of the children of alcoholics, but only ~10% of controls, and the heritability of this trait measured by questionnaire is 40%-60%. Critically, LR predicts later heavy drinking and the negative impact of alcohol abuse and has been demonstrated to be an effective target for directed alcohol management intervention, yet despite its clear translational importance, the biological underpinnings of this trait have yet to be fully characterised and replicated.

McGowan",Investigating maternal cannabis exposure during pregnancy and epigenetic alterations in offspring,"Cannabis is widely used for recreational and medical purposes with usage increasing rapidly following its legalization in parts of the world[1].  While there are well-documented effects of cannabis on the users themselves, the impact of its consumption during pregnancy on offspring is much less clear. Previous studies have reported that maternal cannabis usage during pregnancy is associated with lower birth weight and there is the suggestion of impaired neurodevelopment in both observational cohorts in humans and experimental studies in animal models[2-7]. However, how maternal cannabis exposure leads to these adverse health outcomes in offspring remains unclear.

Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in regulating gene expression and cell homeostasis. Previous experimental studies showed that DNA methylation in offspring could be modified by maternal cannabis exposure[8-10]. In some cases this leads to dysregulation of the immune system of the fetus[11-13].  However, no human studies have yet been conducted, and no specific epigenetic signatures have been identified related to cannabis exposures.  We hypothesize that maternal cannabis exposure during pregnancy alters the epigenetic profiles and leads to a specific epigenetic signature of the fetus through in utero exposure, and the epigenetic alterations can then lead to impaired neurodevelopment in the offspring. Therefore, we propose to investigate the association of maternal cannabis exposure around the time of pregnancy with DNA methylation profiles in offspring at birth in the ALSPC cohort.","With increasing prevalence of cannabis consumption in young adults, it is paramount to understand how cannabis exposures during pregnancy may affect fetal health, particularly neurodevelopment. In this study we focus on epigenetic alterations related to cannabis, which can provide insights on how cannabis exposure may impact the health outcome of next generation.","Friday, 7 February, 2020","Wednesday, 12 February, 2020","Genetic epidemiology (including association studies and mendelian randomisation), Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Cognitive impairment, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., epigenetics, Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Epigenetics, Offspring"

In the third stage, these 43 SNPs were individually genotyped in a sample which spanned the entire spectrum of ability. 10 SNP associations remained significant. Though effect sizes were extremely small, when a composite SNP-score was created for subjects in the final sample by summing the number of 'mathemtics score increasing alleles', these 10 SNPs accounted for 2.9% of the phenotypic variation in the sample. Interestingly, when the remaining 33 SNPs were added to this score, they did not mask this effect on mathematical performance, but rather increased it.

Because the total number of eggs she will ever have is established while forming in her motherâs womb, it is important to know if there are any factors in that prenatal environment that may affect the development of the eggs within the ovaries.  Women with fewer eggs may suffer later in life from infertility or early menopause.  Several studies have shown through experiments with animals that paracetamol taken by the mother while pregnant may have harmful effects on the reproductive function of the resulting female offspring.  However, no studies have examined this in humans.  In animal models, there are three proposed mechanisms for the effects seen in the female offspring:  1) disruption of the chemical signaling from the brain to the ovaries to induce puberty, resulting in earlier age of the onset of periods (which in human studies may be associated with earlier onset of menopause), 2) disruption of the natural menstrual cycle, resulting in shorter menstrual periods (which in human studies may be associated with earlier onset of menopause), and 3) formation of fewer follicles (eggs) in the ovaries, which can be approximated by measurement of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) in the blood.  Given that paracetamol is used worldwide as the analgesic of choice during pregnancy it is of critical importance that large-scale studies of humans be performed to investigate this association.  This study will look at children of mothers who did and did not use paracetamol during their pregnancies and compare 1) the age of their first period, 2) how regular their periods are, and 3) their AMH levels.","This will be the first epidemiologic investigation of in utero paracetamol exposure on female reproductive dysfunction.  While there have been several animal studies demonstrating deleterious effects of paracetamol in therapeutic doses to female offspring reproductive function, this has not been demonstrated in humans.  If this study does show an association of paracetamol exposure with earlier onset if menarche, increased incidence of menstrual irregularity, or lower AMH levels this will suggest that there may be an effect in humans and may indicate a possible mechanism.  This would have major public health implications as paracetamol is currently the analgesic of choice for women in pregnancy.  If there are no findings from this investigation associating paracetamol use with reproductive outcomes then this is reassuring for the population of pregnant women who rely on paracetamol to treat pain in pregnancy.","Monday, 10 December, 2018","Wednesday, 12 December, 2018","Epidemiology, Fertility/infertility, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Statistical methods, Biological samples -e.g. blood, cell lines, saliva, etc., Endocrine - endocrine disrupters, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution, Puberty"

Because the defects occur during early embryonic development, maternal factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, folate deficiency and hypothyroidism, acting both before and during pregnancy have been suggested as risk factors in epidemiological studies. However, maternal behaviours during pregnancy are strongly socially patterned and this could mean that genetic risk factors for cleft are also associated with educational and socioeconomic factors.

Across human populations, smoking during pregnancy remains above 10%. To better discover and apply effective interventions, it is important to determine the exposure of each child. Unfortunately, simply asking mothers about their smoking behaviour is not sufficient due to lapses in memory, reluctance to admit smoking or failure to accurately define smoking behaviour. Measurement of cotinine in maternal blood, urine or saliva can improve detection but may miss cases of intermittent smoking because cotinine is cleared quickly during pregnancy. Fortunately, children retain evidence of prenatal tobacco exposure in the DNA methylation of their blood even beyond the age of 17. However, since blood collections are a precious and finite resource many cohort studies have derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from blood samples. LCLs are B cells that have been transformed to spontaneously replicate, thereby providing a constant supply of new biological material. Although the transformation process is known to disrupt DNA methylation marks, a recent study has reported associations between LCL DNA methylation and present tobacco smoking. We would like to test associations of prenatal tobacco exposure in LCL DNA methylation and determine the extent to which the transformation process has modified these associations by comparing them to associations in B cells isolated from matching blood samples.

However, despite compelling evidence to support foetal programming of physical health, neurodevelopment has remained understudied. Recently, autism has gained increased attention within this field of research. Although largely caused by genetic factors, it is now estimated that approximately 20% of the risk of developing autism relates to environmental factors, of which nutrition is a main focus. Preliminary evidence indicates that the risk of developing autism may be reduced through consumption of a nutritionally adequate diet or nutritional supplements. Furthermore, the presence of social patterning is unknown. Health inequities are observed in numerous health outcomes as low socioeconomic position groups experience more adversity including poorer diet quality. Thus, it is possible that, where an association existed between maternal diet and their childâs risk of autism, it may also be socially patterned.","This project will inform prevention strategies by addressing three main research gaps; estimating causality, identifying critical periods and exploring health inequalities. Firstly, this research will estimate the causal association between nutritional status in pregnancy and the risk of autism in offspring. In doing so, it will address the lack of evidence supporting a healthy diet in pregnancy. Furthermore, it is well recognised that misinformation in pregnancy is common and that dietary information may be more affected than information regarding general health. Yet at present, there is limited evidence on the impact of obesity, weight gain and diet in pregnancy on outcomes in offspring.

Secondly, by identifying critical periods we can target prevention strategies more effectively. This project measures the impact of nutritional status in pregnancy, breast or formula feeding and infant dietary intake. All of which may have independent or accumulative effects on autism. Through contributing to the evidence base on a healthy diet in pregnancy this project will feed into a larger pool of evidence that informs national guidelines such as NICE: Maternal and Child Nutrition (PH11).  

Thirdly, exploring health inequalities may also help to target prevention strategies to those most in need. The UK Government stipulated that proportional universalism should be incorporated into prevention strategies however, few studies measure health inequalities. By evidencing health inequalities this project may indicate where to target resources and it may promote confidence in dietitians to open-up discussion on health inequalities. Through contributing to the evidence base on a healthy diet in pregnancy this project will feed into a larger pool of evidence that informs national guidelines such as NICE: Maternal and Child Nutrition (PH11).","Friday, 6 September, 2019","Friday, 6 September, 2019","Epidemiology, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Developmental disorders - autism, Cognitive impairment, Speech/language problem, Statistical methods, Birth outcomes, BMI, Nutrition - breast feeding, diet, Offspring, Speech and language, Statistical methods, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Communication (including non-verbal), Development, Epigenetics, Genetic epidemiology, Mothers - maternal age, menopause, obstetrics"

Maternal life-style related factors during this critical period affects the health and wellbeing of the developing fetus. Specifically, prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke via maternal smoking during pregnancy, increases the risk for respiratory illnesses [1, 2], asthma [3], cleft lip and palate [4] as well as inflammatory polyarthropathies [5] and childhood obesity [6]. Similar to maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal overweight and obesity is associated with adverse birth outcomes and has been reported in at least one study to exceed smoking as a risk factor with the greatest risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [7]. While maternal overweight likely affects caries development in the child, the mechanism by which this happens is yet to be elucidated [8].

Development of the primary tooth germ commences at the end of the 5th week of gestation with mineralization starting during the 13th week and continuing on throughout pregnancy to the end of the first year of life for primary teeth and up to 6 years of age for permanent teeth [10]. During this period of tooth development, prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke can negatively affect the quality (i.e. tooth calcification and mineralization) [11] and subsequent timing of tooth eruption [12, 13]. Ntani and colleagues reported that children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had more teeth erupted at ages 1 and 2 compared to similarly aged children whose mothers did not smoke during pregnancy [13] and suggested that premature tooth eruption likely lie on the causal pathway between maternal smoking during pregnancy and subsequent caries development. In addition, smoking during pregnancy [14], and pregnancy adiposity [9] are associated with low-birth weight and prematurity, factors reported to increase the risk of developmental enamel defects like hypo-mineralization and hypo-calcification [11, 15]. These developmental tooth defects increases tooth susceptibility to cariogenic bacteria [16, 17] in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates [11].

Maternal smoking during pregnancy, exposes the growing fetus to chemical toxins including nicotine through its direct metabolite cotinine which cross the placenta to accumulate in fetal tissues [18]. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke alters fetal blood flow and protein metabolism, resulting in the accumulation of chemical toxins in the mother and developing fetus [1]. While smoking throughout pregnancy likely increases offspring caries experience, the critical exposure period appears to be the first trimester of pregnancy. Indeed, maternal smoking and weight [8] in the first trimester, were independently associated with increases in subsequent dental caries risk in children [19] and teenagers [8] more so than exposures occurring during other periods of pregnancy. This finding has not been independently replicated in other population groups and there are methodologic limitations on how timing during pregnancy was assessed.",null,"Friday, 15 September, 2017","Wednesday, 20 September, 2017","Epidemiology, Obesity, Dental caries, BMI, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Dental, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution, Offspring, Statistical methods"

This initiative has been facilitated by the availability of low-cost hi-resolution three-dimensional systems which have the ability to capture the facial details of thousands of individuals quickly and accurately. Simultaneous advances in genotyping technology have enabled the exploration of genetic influences on facial phenotypes, both in the present day and across human history. There are several important reasons for exploring the genetics of normal-range variation in facial morphology.

- Disentangling the environmental factors and relative parental biological contributions to heritable traits can help to answer the age-old question âwhy we look the way that we do?â

- Understanding the aetiology of craniofacial anomalies; e.g., unaffected family members of individuals with non-syndromic cleft lip/palate (nsCL/P) have been shown to differ in terms of normal-range facial variation to the general population suggesting an etiological link between facial morphology and nsCL/P.

- Many factors such as ancestry, sex, eye/hair colour as well as distinctive facial features (such as, shape of the chin, cheeks, eyes, forehead, lips, and nose) can be identified or estimated using an individualâs genetic data, with potential applications in healthcare and forensics.

- Improved understanding of historical selection and adaptation relating to facial phenotypes, for example, skin pigmentation and geographical latitude.

- Highlighting what is known about shared facial traits, medical conditions and genes.

This project will be an advancement on a previous studies undertaken at 15 years of age which has yielded a series of landmark articles. The 15 year old cohort will be recalled at 30 and 3D facial images will be collected for as many of the original 4747 15 year old faces as well as their mothers/fathers and their own offspring.

The computer generated 3D facial images/shells will be important in exploring:

- the link between normal variation and craniofacial anomalies

- heritability of facial features (e.g. overall face size/shape and local features nose, lips chin etc)

- Environmental and shared genetic influences on facial shape and reported medical conditions

- Facial ageing from 15 to 30 years of age

- Forensic science relating to identification of facial types from genetic data

- Engagement of the ALSPAC family in deriving relatedness in parents and offspring

- Enable the research team to lead and collaborate with other international cohort studies/cleft lip and palate/craniofacial anomalies/normal facial variation and shared genetic consortia.","Will provide easy visual understanding/presentations to help answer ""why we look the way we do"".

One example is sensitivity to sounds, and there are several ways this can present. For people with MISOPHONIA, certain sounds such as chewing cause an extreme emotional response such as anger, disgust or anxiety; and for people with HYPERACUSIS, loud sounds cause the ears to physically hurt. Sensory sensitivity can have a negative impact on mental well-being, and also plays a role in a number of conditions including autism spectrum conditions, anxiety disorders, and synaesthesia. In turn, poor well-being can have significant financial costs with over Â£12 billion invested annually by the NHS. Our study has become all the more relevant given the COVID crisis because we are interested in a condition that triggers anxiety/anger/distress, and has particular resonance for family relationships in confined spaces.","The impact of our research will be considerable, both in the field of auditory sensitivities, but also sensory sensitivities more widely, as well as in related conditions (autism) and more broadly in the field of education. Misophonia was first identified as recently as 2001 (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001). As a new area of research, there is still much to learn. We will come to understand how/when misophonia initially presents, how it impacts school life, education, mental health, and overall well-being. Our findings will have important implications for developing targeted diagnostics and treatments for childhood populations. We will better understand schooling (Do children with misophonia have poorer attendance? Lower attainment? Difficulties paying attention in class?). And we will also better understand the prevalence of these conditions.

The main health effect specific to domestic violence during pregnancy is the threat to health and risk of death of the mother, foetus, or both, from trauma (El Kady et al, 2005; Pearlman et al, 1990). Domestic violence is also associated with depression, anxiety, insomnia, alcohol and drug abuse, and suicide attempts (Campbell 2002). However, the impact of domestic violence during pregnancy on the risk ofchild development has not been previously investigated to our knowledge. A recent study has reported, though, on the significant impact of postnatal domestic violence on child development, which, with postnatal depression, had a cumulative effect, leading to worse child outcome (Whitaker et al, 2006). There is increasing evidence that prenatal stress and major depression during pregnancy are associated with increased concentrations of corticotrophin releasing hormone (O'Keane et al, submitted); this increase in pituitary-adrenal activity may explain the association of domestic violence during pregnancy with poor obstetric outcomes (low birthweight and preterm pregnancy) . Domestic violence may therefore adversely affect child development independent of the effect of antenatal psychiatric morbidity or subsequent psychiatric morbidity, but any effects on child development may also be partly mediated by antenatal psychiatric morbidity.",null,"Wednesday, 30 May, 2007","Wednesday, 30 May, 2007",

Further, there is growing evidence that adverse effects, for example on mental and physical health, persist in to adulthood.  But not all children exposed to ACEs have poor outcomes.  A better understanding of protective factors, particularly those amenable to change, could identify suitable targets for intervention.  Little previous research on consequences of exposure to ACEs has considered the context in which the child lives beyond their family.  Schools are a dominate context in the lives of children and adolescents, and the neighbourhood environment of their home and school becomes of increasing importance as children grow older and have more autonomy.  Amongst children who experience adversity in childhood, characteristics of their school and neighbourhood may influence their likelihood of positive outcomes over and above individual and family characteristics.  If this is true, interventions at a school and neighbourhood level could be beneficial.  In this study, the outcomes considered will include school attendance, educational attainment, and entrance to higher education, mental health, and criminal involvement.","We hope our research will provide evidence to guide interventions aimed at improving the life chances of children who experience substantial adversity.

Tan,Causal relationship between circulating low density lipoprotein C (LDL-C) and the IGF pathway: A Recall by Genotype study in ALS,"Population-based studies examining the relationship between IGF-I and IGFBP-3 with lipids have yielded conflicting results [1-3]. However, most of the studies are limited by their cross-sectional design and suffer from problems such as reverse causality and confounding. Several epidemiological studies have shown that statin use is associated with decreased levels of circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 [4-6].  These findings suggest that changes in the IGF pathway can be affected by metabolic changes. Further studies are needed to elucidate the direction of the causal relationship between lipids and the IGF pathway. One approach to investigate causality is Mendelian randomization (MR) which uses genetic variants as proxies for an observational exposure to assess and quantify the causal relationship between exposures of interest and outcomes or intermediate phenotypes [7]. Using summary level Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) results from two large-scale GWAS for IGF pathway (IGF-I and IGFBP-3) [8] and lipids traits (low density lipoprotein C (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein C (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG)) [9], our recent MR analysis found evidence that increased LDL-C levels was associated with increased IGFBP-3 levels (unpublished results). To replicate these findings and to investigate the causal relationship between circulating LDL-C levels and members of the IGF pathway (IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3), we are proposing to carry out a sample-based Recall by Genotype (RbG) study using a rare genetic variant in PCSK9 (rs11591147) that is associated with circulating LDL-C levels [10].",null,"Thursday, 26 October, 2017","Tuesday, 31 October, 2017","Epidemiology, Cancer, Radioimmunoassay and ELISA, Biological samples -e.g. blood, cell lines, saliva, etc., Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc., Hormones - cortisol, IGF, thyroid"

We will do this using secure technologies and protecting patientsâ confidentiality.

By combining and analysing data, we will be able to work with public services to help identify people at higher risk of a condition or disease, and deliver better, more joined up care that is both more effective and offers better value.","This application is centred on an existing partnership across NHS organisations, local government, and academia, brought together through the BNSSG Population Health Management (PHM) Steering group to support “Healthier Together” the regional ICS that will succeed the BNSSG Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) over the next two years. As emphasised in the NHS Long-term Plan, the viability and value of an ICS will depend on the availability of a readily analysable person level view of the population and its interactions with the health and care system(5). The BNSSG Systemwide dataset was established for this purpose. The proposed data platform would extend available BNSSG Systemwide dataset linkages beyond the health care system, to include a view of wider determinants of health, such as social care and criminal justice, as well as research data, broadening the application of the resource.  Such an integrated data resource would support: 
a)	mapping of patients’ pathways across multiple services
b)	evaluation and improvement of service delivery across multiple organisations
c)	understanding of the efficiencies and effectiveness of a whole care system
d)	understanding public need across the whole system
e)	the effective rapid response to emerging threats
f)	understanding wider influences on well-being

Perinatal usually refers to the period immediately before and after birth, starting at the 20th to 28th week of gestation and ending 1 to 4 weeks after birth; while the postnatal period can be defined as the first 6-8 weeks after birth. Although knowledge is increasing, more research is needed to clarify the associations between parental and offspring mental illness.

The theory behind the potential associations between perinatal and postnatal risk factors and subsequent offspring mental health problems proposes that environmental stress, during pregnancy, such as life event exposure, may affect the neurodevelopment of the foetus and lead to an increased risk of psychopathology.

Among the perinatal and postnatal risk factors that have been investigated in the last years, maternal postnatal depression is one of the most relevant and studied risk factors, and thus most of the existing research is solely focused on this specific risk factor. Further, maternal postnatal depression is known to have an adverse effect on several aspects of child and adolescent development, including social, emotional, and cognitive function, and is associated with offspring depressive symptoms in adolescence and adulthood. Maternal postnatal depression might negatively affect bonding and parenting during infancy, which might affect offspring attachment style and increase the risk of psychotic experiences, among others.

In addition to postnatal depression, there are some other perinatal and postnatal risk factors that could be considered a form of psychological distress and that might reflect chronic maternal stress, which could affect the neurodevelopment of offspring. Among these risk factors, perinatal and postnatal maternal sleeping problems, family adversity, substance abuse, gestational age, or maternal age when birth could also play an important role in the development of subsequent mental health problems in adolescence, such as depressive and psychotic symptoms. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating a range of relevant perinatal and postnatal risk factors for subsequent psychopathology in adolescence.",This research will provide novel information about the role of perinatal and postnatal risk factors for the development of offsprings depressive and psychotic symptoms in adolescence.,"Thursday, 11 March, 2021","Monday, 15 March, 2021","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health"

Yet there is much to learn about how becoming a parent for the first time influences underlying biology. Researchers have begun to study changes in brain structure and function, as well as functioning of the heart, and pattern of fat and muscle in the body. These changes may help to prepare for the transition to parenthood, but also may have positive and negative consequences for future health. This project aims to study these changes in more detail using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by studying adults before and after having their first child. ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) is a long-term health project that has studied parents and their children since the early 1990s. The âChildren of the 90sâ are now having their own children; these births represent an unparalleled time limited opportunity to study the health consequences of pregnancy and parenthood. We will use records collected since birth from the Children of the 90s to predict how their bodies might cope with the challenge of parenthood. There is also much to understand about infant development. By collecting MRI data on the brain and body early in lives of the Children of the Children of the 90s, we will gain greater understanding of how the body develops. By comparing the data from parents with their children, this project will provide a unique opportunity to study the influence of parental biology on their childâs development.","Novel and important findings will be made possible through this project by further understanding the changes in body composition and the structure and functioning of the brain and heart during the perinatal period. Thus far, this has been understudied in the literature using small sample sizes. This project has the potential for high impact in this field due to the retrospective analyses made possible by the three generational nature of the dataset and existing detailed phenotypic and genetic records on participants therein. Such analyses will allow us to predict who may be at risk of negative outcomes and to give the possibility of early intervention. Beyond the specific hypotheses specified here, the newly acquired imaging data has huge potential for impact in numerous subject areas through prospective analyses.

However, our understanding of the impact of CNVs on psychiatric symptomatology, RDoC domains and neurocognitive ability (termed âdimensional neuropsychiatric phenotypesâ) is limited in at least three ways. First, the effects sizes of the vast majority of CNVs on neuropsychiatric phenotypes remain poorly understood and their rarity will likely to prevent individual association studies. Prior studies concentrated on the most recurrent CNVs, leaving more than 90% of these variants undocumented. Second, for CNVs frequent enough to be studied individually, the full spectrum of phenotypic variation is unknown because ascertainment has been performed through neurodevelopmental and specialty clinics, which presumably represent the severe end of the phenotypic spectrum. Only a few studies have been conducted in unselected populations. Finally, many CNVs seem to impact the same neuropsychiatric domains, suggesting a poly/omnigenic model for psychiatric symptomatology, RDoC domains and neurocognitive ability. Based on this hypothesis, our previous work has shown that genetic scores and functional annotations can accurately predict the effect of any CNV on IQ but these approaches have not yet been extended beyond IQ to other dimensional neuropsychiatric phenotypes. We will fill these knowledge gaps with a novel, multidisciplinary, collaborative project that leverages existing archival data (n=255,303) to estimate and predict the effect sizes of CNVs (duplications and deletions) on dimensional neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Our aims include 1) phenotypic harmonization; 2) characterizing previously identified risk CNVs for mental illness in a large in general population cohorts and in samples ascertained for mental illnesses; 3) examine the contribution of common variants to variable expressivity of rare CNVs via polygenic risk scores (PRS) in the domains of mood, psychosis, developmental disability, and general cognitive ability; and 4) develop novel models to explain the effect size of any rare CNVs on dimensional neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Finally, we will develop tools for data sharing.","The scientific premise of our application is that rare CNVs, which are strongly associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, provide a unique window into the genetic architecture of mental disorders that can be exploited to better understand idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders. There are currently several knowledge gaps that limit the insights that CNVs provide for understanding the pathobiology of mental illness. Our application is designed to address three of these gaps. 

As we are using only existing data and previously collected DNA samples, there are no direct therapeutic benefits for subjects in this study. However, increased knowledge about genetic architecture of mental illness provides significant potential benefits to society in general, and to patients with mental illnesses and their families in particular. Since the risks of participating in this study only minimally exceed those of routine clinical review, we believe the potential benefits, though primarily indirect, exceed the minimal risks.

Characterizing the effect of rare CNVs on a host of neuropsychiatric phenotypes should provide invaluable clues to the elusive pathophysiology of mental illnesses, which are common, debilitating, and costly diseases. Furthermore, if we detect the means to identify individuals with genotypes that predispose to such disorders, either with genetic signatures or with neurocognitive measures, this information could be used for a primary prevention strategy and possibly suggesting new approaches to treatment. Any novel insights into biological mechanisms that predispose individuals to mental illnesses could contribute to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","Thursday, 29 August, 2019","Monday, 2 September, 2019","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Developmental disorders - autism, Cognitive impairment, Mental health, Obesity, Computer simulations/modelling/algorithms, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics"

Atopic eczema, hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and atopic asthma often co-exist. Early diagnosis and appropriate management can reduce progression and severity of these diseases.

The Born in Bradford (BiB) birth cohort includes over 13,500 children born between 2007 and 2011, with around half born to women of Pakistani ethnicity. Linked primary care and hospital admission data are available for 97% of BiB children. Two sub-studies within BiB, the Allergy and Infection Study (ALL IN, n=2559) and Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL, n=1814), have collected detailed parental questionnaire data at age 1 and 2 years (ALL IN) and at 4 years (MeDALL). The current data collection phase for the whole BiB cohort, Growing Up, at ages 7-11 years is ongoing and also includes questions on these outcomes.

The BiB data provide an opportunity to investigate trajectories of allergic disease and asthma through childhood, by ethnic group. The linked primary care and hospital electronic health records (EHR) will contribute a wealth of data which can be analysed with machine learning methods. There is uncertainty over the validity of routine data but the extensive BiB questionnaire data at different ages provide a rare opportunity to test this.

The aims of this proposed study are:

1) to link research and routine data to explore early life and childhood longitudinal trajectories and describe clinical phenotypes of asthma, eczema and hay fever;

2) to investigate ethnic inequalities in access to care and presentation of these diseases

3) to investigate early life risk factors for these diseases

Questionnaire data are available from the BiB ALL IN sub-study at age 1 year, including questions on pets, family history of asthma/eczema/hay fever, housing conditions (damp, heating, flooring, bedding etc.), and at 2 years (as for age 1 plus eczema, hay fever, food allergy). Detailed data relevant to asthma, eczema and hay fever are available for the MeDALL sub-study participants at 4 years, including skin prick testing for 2269.

BiB receive regular extracts of primary care EHR data on diagnoses and prescriptions for BiB children, which will be linked to the BiB maternal baseline questionnaire data, including socio-demographic and household characteristics. Linked hospital admissions data are available from the Bradford Royal Infirmary. We will also compare EHR data and questionnaire data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).

Latent class analysis or other cluster methods, such as k-means clustering, will be used to identify clinical phenotypes of asthma, eczema and hay fever. Longitudinal extensions of these cluster methods will be used to describe trajectories over age.

This study will provide important data on the validity of routine primary care EHR for asthma and allergic diseases, which is relevant as EHR are increasingly used for research studies. The comparison of questionnaire and EHR data will indicate whether there are ethnic differences in access to primary care for these diseases. Identification of clinical phenotypes of asthma, eczema and hay fever will inform appropriate treatment and management and the identification of factors associated with disease progression or severity could indicate potential prevention strategies.","This study will provide important data on the validity of routine primary care EHR for asthma and allergic diseases, which is relevant as EHR are increasingly used for research studies.

A plethora of methods exist for modelling such data, with mixed or multi-level models being at the forefront. However there is a lack of approaches capable of estimating features of trajectories borne out of such data. To accurately estimate a feature (such as the minimum or maximum of a trajectory) requires a descriptive approach not restricted by parametric assumptions.

Using a variety of experimental paradigms research is now beginning to unravel the brain’s mechanisms for social skills. Moreover, twin and family studies have demonstrated that a number of these mechanisms are heritable, pointing to an underlying genetic contribution; however, the specific genes involved are not known. We therefore plan to undertake a study to map the genes involved in one aspect of interpersonal interaction termed ‘theory of mind’ (or ToM). We will use a method called genomewide association.  This method looks for relationships between many genetic markers and variation in ToM skills as measured using an established experimental paradigm called the ‘triangles task’. Any markers that demonstrate a significant relationship with ToM indicate that a gene important in this skill is located nearby.

For many such studies, there are valid scientific reasons why involvement of the child's father or male caregiver is also important. For cohort studies, which follow families over time, early recruitment and ongoing engagement of fathers can be particularly important. However, recruiting and engaging fathers to such studies can be challenging, especially if fathers and mothers do not live together. As a result fathers are widely under-represented in such research. A scoping review of recruitment and engagement methods suggests that involving fathers may require a different approach to that used for mothers. This study seeks to review how fathers are recruited and engaged in the ALSPAC G2 cohort, to propose tailored recommendations to improve recruitment and engagement and test the feasibility and acceptability of the revised, tailored approach with participants and research staff. The general learning from this process is expected to be relevant to many similar research projects.","As well as potentially offering a set of tailored recommendations which may improve the participation of fathers in ALSPAC G2, this research will also be relevant for other cohort studies and related projects which are seeking to better involve and engage fathers in research about their children.

However, unlike obesity and type 2 diabetes, the prenatal and perinatal risk factors associated with eating disorders have not been analysed through the lens of health inequalities. This is an important gap. While eating disorders are commonly depicted as conditions that afflict middle-class women, recent studies have found that adults who experience economic precarity are more likely to endorse disordered eating attitudes and practices, suggesting that low socioeconomic status may be associated with the development of eating disorders. The proposed project will develop the first prospective analysis of the influence of parental socioeconomic status on children's disordered eating in adolescence. The project will use data collected as part of ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children).

Notably, ALSPAC collects detailed longitudinal data on parental socioeconomic status, maternal eating disorders, and children's disordered eating, allowing for an analysis of the influence of parental socioeconomic status on children's disordered eating.

Furthermore, evidence suggests that there is a dose-response relationship between birth weight and child behavioral problems (van Os et al., 2001; Wichers et al., 2002; see Wilens et al., 2006 for null findings), including ADHD (Boulet et al., 2009). Given the association between fetal growth and ADHD has been examined primarily in prospective case-control studies, it is necessary to utilize population birth cohorts to further understand the nature of the relationship across the full spectrum of fetal growth and ADHD symptom severity.",null,"Thursday, 14 March, 2013","Thursday, 14 March, 2013","Fetal Growth, Growth, Epigenetics"

For example, children exposed to abuse, neglect, and dysfunctional home environments have an elevated risk of several later psychiatric conditions. However, as highlighted by a new report  by the UK Science and Technology Select Committee (November 2018), it is unclear whether  ACEs cause psychopathology, or whether the associations reflect confounding by genetic and environmental factors. For instance, children exposed to some ACEs (e.g., family psychopathology or substance abuse) might inherit genetic risk of psychopathology from their parents. ACEs also often co-occur with other environmental risks for psychopathology, such as prenatal exposures (e.g., smoking, alcoholism, stress) and postnatal exposures (e.g., poverty). This study will use genetically-informative methods and statistical innovation to disentangle the effects of ACEs from these confounds, and in turn strengthen understanding about the potential causal effects of ACEs in psychopathology.","The findings from this study will inform understanding about the potential causal effects of ACEs on psychopathology, by using stringent causal inference methods (genetically-informative analyses and propensity score techniques) to account for confounders. This will in turn inform understanding about the expected impact of interventions targeting ACEs on the development of mental health problems. For example, if certain ACEs are not associated with psychopathology after accounting for confounders, then interventions targeting those ACEs would not affect rates of mental heath problems among young people. In contrast, if other ACEs have large effects on psychopathology after accounting for confounders, then preventing those ACEs could help prevent children from developing mental health problems. Although preventing all ACEs is a worthy goal in its own right, these findings can inform expectations about the impact of ACE interventions on mental health.","Wednesday, 5 December, 2018","Thursday, 6 December, 2018","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Statistical methods, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Genetics, Genomics, Methods - e.g. cross cohort analysis, data mining, mendelian randomisation, etc., Parenting, Statistical methods"

We propose to compare the ALSPAC cohort members' performance in the contour card test at 11 with their visuoperceptual skills (as elicited in these questions), and their reading abilities, as theory and previous research predict that these might be linked with performance in the contour test.

We believe that the continuum of gestation is influenced both by environmental and genetic factors, and thus we are interested in discovering new genetic factors that are linked to birth timing.","This study has the potential to identify and find new knowledge about predicting and preventing gestations that are bound to go too short or too long, a major and growing health concern Worldwide. Understanding the genetics of gestation is critical to better identify and alleviate the causes of abnormal gestation length, reducing the need for costly and risky obstetric management. For example, low risk interventions such as membrane sweeping reduce the duration of pregnancy while aspirin intake can increase the length of gestation. Therefore, if intervention was indicated as needed earlier in pregnancy, these low risk strategies could modify gestation length, preventing the need for riskier procedures later in the pregnancy.","Tuesday, 31 July, 2018","Tuesday, 7 August, 2018","Bioinformatics, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Computer simulations/modelling/algorithms, DNA sequencing, GWAS, Birth outcomes, Genetic epidemiology, Genome wide association study, Mothers - maternal age, menopause, obstetrics"

On this basis, we will be able to give an answer to the question posed above: that is, by comparing, for each cohort, the subsequent educational attainment of children who at around age 10 were of similar ability and by ascertaining how far differences in their attainment are associated with their social origins.

It will do so with a view to making an impact on the actins of key stakeholders involved in addressing the problem. In particular, the study will rely on two national cohort studies reflecting the lives of individuals born in 1958 and 1970, and on a local cohort study of children born in 1991-92 providing a unique set of information based on biomarkers, anthropometric measures, linkages with rich administrative data, along with more traditional survey questions. The study will leverage biomarkers in the latter cohort and genetic information in all three cohorts in a detailed investigation of the causal pathways that link children early life exposures and background socioeconomic status to their likelihood of developing obesity in young age, to the social and economic outcomes associated with childhood obesity. In particular, the study will focus on dimensions of human capital (education and cognitive skills) and returns to human capital, in the form of employment and earnings, as well as forms of civic participation and social engagement.","This project aims at establishing evidence of causal impacts of childhood obesity on social and economic outcomes for the children concerned. This would significantly strengthen the case for action to tackle the current childhood obesity epidemic, because the long time frame in which the health impacts of childhood obesity typically materialise, and the relatively small (health) effect size of the interventions available to address obesity mean that a case for government action made purely on health grounds will provide weak support to interventions. Although most social and economic benefits from addressing childhood obesity (and generally poor health outcomes) accrue to the individuals concerned rather than the public purse or society at large, these benefits must be accounted for in order to capture the full welfare effects of interventions, particularly those arising from government policies aimed at improving population health. The effective tackling of childhood obesity and its social and economic consequences will improve the long-term sustainability of the NHS by containing the future demand for medical care, particularly in connection with early-onset chronic non-communicable diseases, and by protecting revenue inflows through a healthier a more productive workforce.
Additional impacts of the research will derive from a more detailed knowledge than it is available at present of the pathways and mechanisms through which the social and economic impacts of childhood obesity are generated, which will give policy makers and other stakeholders the means to intervene more effectively in mitigating those impacts in obese children and their families. Mitigating actions may include interventions to prevent the occurrence of detrimental social and economic outcomes in obese children, or compensate then for such detrimental consequences through appropriate redistribution or welfare measures. While assessing the impacts of these actions is not within the scope of this project, the findings generated by the project will provide important inputs into any future assessments.","Sunday, 25 March, 2018","Thursday, 29 March, 2018","Health Economics, Obesity, Mendelian randomisation"

People who experience ACEs are less likely to do well in school, more likely to become unemployed, and more likely to have poor health. Furthermore, since people who live in socioeconomic deprivation are more at risk of experiencing ACEs, and also more at risk of poor health, ACEs are one mechanism that could drive socioeconomic inequalities in health. However, most of the research to date has looked at ACEs as a whole, and not asked whether experiencing ACEs at different points during infancy, childhood and adolescence might have different impacts. This is important, because it affects decisions about how we best support people who experience ACEs. If ACEs in infancy have the biggest effect on later outcomes, then focusing support on the early years will be most beneficial. Whereas if ACEs at older ages also cause problems, potentially ‘derailing’ people from their previous educational level for example, that would imply that continued support across the whole of childhood and adolescence is important. At a time when local government budgets are severely stretched, generating evidence to help support the justification and prioritisation of interventions is crucial. At present, our ability to carry out high-quality cost-effectiveness analysis of interventions to mitigate the effects of ACEs is limited by a lack of good evidence on the effects of ACEs on key economic outcomes, and how these effects differ across the life course. In this project, we will plug this gap, using extremely detailed data about experiences of ACEs across the life course, linked with detailed family and socioeconomic data, and repeated measures of educational attainment, employment, and health. We will explore the links between ACEs and education and employment, whether these are affected by the timing, duration and recency of ACE exposure, and the mechanisms underlying the associations.

The 2020 SARS-Cov-2 pandemic is likely to have severe implications for children experiencing ACEs and adults who have experienced ACEs. The ‘lockdown’ measures are likely to lead to increased occurrence of ACEs. Missed schooling is likely to be more detrimental for already vulnerable children, and many children who were entitled to continue attending school during lockdown did not do so. Job losses and reductions in income have been concentrated in the already disadvantaged, and the uncertain job market going forwards will pose a greater risk to young adults without the cushioning of a stable family environment and educational success. Using new data collected during the pandemic, we will assess whether young adults who have experienced ACEs are more vulnerable to the economic consequences of the pandemic, e.g. reduced income, furlough, or job loss. This evidence could provide support to the continued and increased need for the provision of services for people experiencing ACEs at this time.

We will work with key academic and non-academic collaborators to ensure that the results from this project are used to support the case for services designed to support people who have experienced ACEs, including with our results being used directly to improve the quality of cost-effectiveness analyses for interventions.","A key route for non-academic dissemination will be via the local government teams in the West of England (Bristol, North Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Swindon) with whom the team already have strong links. The local teams have expressed an interest in modelling the cost-effectiveness of interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of ACEs, in order to support the ‘business case’ for their planned initiatives, at a time when local government budgets are under severe pressure. The results from this project will be used to directly feed in to the modelling of specific interventions of interest to local teams by the team at the NIHR Applied Research Collaboration (ARC) West.","Thursday, 24 September, 2020","Tuesday, 29 September, 2020","Social Science, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Social science"

There is also evidence of long-term breastfeeding effects, including lower blood pressure and total cholesterol, reduced risk of obesity and type-2 diabetes, and higher performance in intelligence tests.

To have long-term effects, it is necessary that having been breastfed or not (as well as other aspects, such as quality and duration) gets “imprinted” in the body and such imprinting lasts until later life periods. In this regard, epigenetics (the study of specific regulators of where, when and how much genes – regions of the DNA that contain information to generate proteins and other products by the cell – are on or off) is of potential interest. Importantly, epigenetic modifications normally pass from one cell to another after cell division, so epigenetic modifications are not easily erased throughout cell cycles over time.

Previous studies using ALSPAC data reported that maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with methylation (a type of epigenetic marker, consisting of a chemical modification in specific regions of the DNA) patterns in the offspring that sustained until later life stages. Regarding breastfeeding, a few studies looking at specific regions of the methylome (set of all regions of the DNA where methylation can occur) provide some evidence that epigenetic factors might be involved with breastfeeding effects. However, no study to date scanned the entire methylome in relation to breastfeeding or evaluated the maintenance of one or more breastfeeding-associated methylation patterns over time.

Regarding intelligence, an additional potential mechanism relates to breast milk being a source of long-chain polyunsaturared fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which have been implicated in brain development. Indeed, many milk substitutes currently include DHA and other LC-PUFAs. One possibility to test this hypothesis is to evaluate if the association between breastfeeding and intelligence differs according to the individual’s capacity to synthetize DHA from metabolic precursors. Special attention has been given to genetic variation in the FADS2 gene, which encodes a protein involved in desaturation processes required for endogenous synthesis of LC-PUFAS from shorter chain fatty acids. However, two published studies (including one study using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children – ALSPAC) in this regarding successfully detected a FADS2-breastfeeding interaction, but the coefficients were in inconsistent. Three additional twin studies did not detect any strong interaction. Therefore, there is no firm conclusion regarding a potential FADS2-breastfeeding interaction to date. Such potential interaction also suggests that other metabolic processes might play important roles in the health effects of breastfeeding, although a comprehensive evaluation (eg, using metabolimic data) has not been performed to date. We will also analyse the rs66698963 polymorphism, which is a 22 bp insert-deletion within FADS2. This polymorphism has recently been associated with LC-PUFA levels. Moreover, signs of positive selection have also been detected, suggesting that this SNP may be functional.

In general, genetic aspects of breastfeeding have been poorly studied. However, narrow-sense heritability estimates of breastfeeding behaviour (ever vs. never) 44%-85% that have been reported in different populations. This suggests that genetic variants account for a substantial proportion of variability in breastfeeding behaviour in these populations and are, therefore, important aspects of breastfeeding. It also raises the possibility that genetic factors underlie at least some of the association of breastfeeding with health outcomes through pleiotropic effects (either mediated by or independent on breastfeeding). Moreover, exploring breastfeeding genetics might also lead to the identification of genetic variants robustly associated with breastfeeding, which could be used as instrumental variables to strengthen causal inferences through the Mendelian randomization design.

The present project aims at investigating biological mechanisms underlying breastfeeding health effects by studying the FADS2-breastfeeding interaction and additional genetic, epigenetic and metabolic aspects of breastfeeding.",null,"Tuesday, 19 April, 2016","Wednesday, 20 April, 2016",Genetics

Firstly, as a proof of principle, we will compare the predictive power of different PGS using single and repeated measure phenotypes including mood (depression), substance use (cannabis use) and anthropometric measures (blood pressure and height). Secondly, we will extend upon previous Mendelian Randomisation analyses to determine the statistical benefits of modelling an exposure and/or an outcome in a repeat measure framework. Finally, we will investigate the potential for increasing power in GWAS’ by using a repeated measures framework to determine if power can be maximised by using repeated measures rather than increased sample size. To meet these ends, we require phenotypic and genomic data at multiple occasions for mood, substance use and anthropometric measures. ALSPAC is the perfect resource for conducting this research given its impressive archive of data and sample.",null,"Friday, 4 August, 2017","Tuesday, 8 August, 2017","Genetics, Statistical methods, Blood pressure, Psychology - personality, Statistical methods"

Farrington",The intergenerational continuity of intimate partner violence: an exploration of possible mechanisms,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is closely associated with the more commonly used term âdomestic violenceâ but is often considered to include a wider range of contexts and behaviours specifically with regard to partners in dating, cohabiting and marital relationships. IPV can be conceptualised as a continuum of abuse, including homicide, minor and severe physical assault, sexual assault, psychological abuse, including threats, harassment, coercion and intimidation. Various studies have demonstrated that both men and women can act as perpetrators and victims. IPV is increasingly reported and is thus a huge burden for public health as it occurs regardless of age, socio-economic status, gender and sexuality and it can result in a number of negative outcomes. These can include but are not limited to substance misuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and suicidal ideation. Not least, and perhaps of greatest concern, is the possibility of intergenerational transmission of IPV. The relationships, particularly those between parents and children, are highly influential and life course events, drug and alcohol abuse and IPV can have a huge impact on their lives. This intergenerational transmission is a widely studied explanation of how family characteristics can impact on the development of aggression and violence in adult relationships. Children raised in households where they are exposed to acts of violence may in turn learn that violence is an appropriate reaction in interpersonal conflictual situations and act accordingly in their own relationships in adulthood. There is currently robust evidence to support this proposition, but there are inconsistencies. Children may have differential responses to this experience, and this may be explained by whether a child experiences abuse directly or only witnesses parental violence. There is currently a dearth of studies that use multiple waves of data garnered from prospective longitudinal studies that address the limitations of prior research. These limitations are the use of cross-sectional or short-term follow-ups, male only studies, female only studies and measurement anomalies. Further exploration of the intergenerational transmission of IPV is therefore warranted taking into consideration the limitations of prior research. A birth cohort provides ideal data to investigate this alongside the possibility of developing further knowledge of the underlying mechanisms involved. There are a number of factors that are known to increase the vulnerabilities for being involved as either victims or perpetrators of IPV. Some psychosocial factors such as family breakdown, maltreatment, mental and physical health, drug and alcohol abuse, personality traits and socio-economic disadvantage have all been shown to be associated with individual variations in IPV. Whether there is a direct relationship between any one of these factors and IPV is unclear, and it is likely that these factors and others may have interactive or sequential effects.","This project will provide deeper aetiological knowledge and provide an insight into the behavioural profiles of those exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV). It will be of interest to academics as it will add to knowledge with regard to the continuity of IPV from one generation to the next and explore possible underlying pathways. It will be of relevance to public health practitioners and policy makers as IPV is robustly associated with negative health outcomes . Furthermore, through the identification of mediators, findings from this project could be used to inform interventions aimed at supporting and reducing the impact of IPV.","Tuesday, 7 July, 2020","Tuesday, 7 July, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Statistical methods, Social science"

Moral behavior is a fundamental issue for human societies. We often make choices on the basis of the subjective value (utility) of the available options. Examples include animal foraging and human value-based decision-making. Utility comes in two flavours. Economic utility captures the personal value consequences of one's decisions whereas moral utility captures value consequences for others. Microeconomic theories of economic utility provide formal models of how economic utility relates to the objective properties of choice options such as their reward magnitude, probability, risk and delay. Crucially, the same economic models also capture moral utility, suggesting that economic and moral utility can be calculated similarly. For example, the expected economic and moral utility of an option can be calculated with: EU=sigma(u(m)*p), where p corresponds to objective reward probability, m to objective reward magnitude, and utility u to a subjective, monotonically increasing function of m. Despite the common formalism, it is an open question whether the behavioural and neural mechanisms underlying economic and moral utility calculations are the same. I have elaborated the framework for the present project more fully elsewhere (Tobler et al., 2008). My previous work revealed neural correlates of economic utility components, particularly in the dopamine system (Tobler et al., 2005, 2007, 2009).",null,"Monday, 21 December, 2009","Monday, 21 December, 2009",Genetics

The various changes associated with puberty have been implicated in the development of these behaviours (Senia 2018). The link between timing of menarche, as a proxy for pubertal development, and psychological distress more generally has been previously established (Mendle 2007, Joinson 2013). However, many questions remain about the relationship between eating disordered behaviours and pubertal development during adolescence. Previous studies have not adequately assessed the age of menarche due to recall bias. This study examines if early menarche could be relevant in the development of eating disordered behaviour using prospective measures from ALSPAC. Furthermore, this study interrogates if the link between early menarche and disordered eating behaviour holds through late adolescence, when early developersâ peers have caught up. In other words, does the association between early pubertal development and disordered eating result from the discord between a child and their peers or does it have more to do with the actual development itself?","This project will lead to a greater understanding of the development of eating disorders in young adolescent girls.

Some  autistic children  for  example  are overwhelmed  by  sounds  or  touch.  This  can  make  everyday  situations  such  as  visiting  a  busy  supermarket  a challenging  task  for  families.  Being  overly  sensitive  has  also  been  linked  to  anxiety.  This  project  will  explore  if sensory  reactivity,  such  as  being  oversensitive  to  sounds,  can  predict  later  anxiety  and  related  mental  health symptoms.  To do  so  we  would analyse already collected ALSPAC data on sensory reactivity and mental health symptoms from 6 months of age onwards.  This includes already collected caregivers questionnaires  about  how  their  child  reacts  to  the  sensory  world  around  them,  such  as  sounds  and  lights, and questions about anxiety.  That  way  we can  test  if  the  relationship  between  sensory  reactivity  and  anxiety  and  related  mental  health  issues  is  stable over  time.  Also  we  can  test  if  early  sensory  reactivity  can  predict  later  mental  health  symptoms.  Identifying whether  sensory  reactivity  predicts  mental  health  symptoms  over  time  could  lead  to  a  clinical  impact.  If  sensory reactivity  symptoms  such  as  being  oversensitive  to  sounds  are  identified  and  treated  earlier,  it  might  be possible  to  reduce  the  impact  of  subsequent  mental  health  problems,  such  as  anxiety.  Last, this project will allow us to investigate genetic underpinnings of sensory reactivity and identify potential biomarkers for sensory reactivity issues, such as hyper-and-hypo reactivity.","Anxiety  and  related  mental  health  symptoms  is  at  the core  of  this  project.  Anxiety  ranks  very  high  amongst  the  factors  that  influence  mental  health  and  quality  of  life, and  is  therefore  one  of  the  key  dependent  variables  of  this  project.  The  proposed  research  will  investigate  the role  of  sensory  reactivity  in  the  co-evolution  of  mental  health  symptoms,  focusing  particularly  on  anxiety.  If  evidence  in  support  of  a  causal  role  for  sensory  reactivity  is  found  by  the  project,  it  can potentially  lead  to  long-term  clinical  impact.  Early identification  of  sensory  reactivity  symptoms  such  as
hyperreactivity  can  in  turn  be  used  to  make  modifications  to  lifestyle  and  environment,  thereby  reducing  the probability  of  development  of  anxiety.  Moreover,  if  sensory  reactivity  symptoms  such  as  hyperreactivity  are identified  and  treated  earlier,  it  might  be  possible  to  reduce  the  impact  of  subsequent  mental  health  problems,
such  as  anxiety.  Elucidating  the  critical  co-evolution  of  sensory  reactivity,  anxiety  and  related  mental  health symptoms ,  can  lead  to  clinical  impact  by  identifying  sensitive  time  points for  intervention  and  to  the  development  of  personalizing  treatments  according  to  sensory  subtype  and  related mental  health  outcome.","Tuesday, 25 September, 2018","Tuesday, 25 September, 2018","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Developmental disorders - autism, Statistical methods, Development"

Evidence has emerged from cohort studies and animal models of disease of a link between viruses and many autoimmune conditions. The development of several promising vaccines and therapies targeting viral infection affords the tantalising possibility that new agents and existing antiviral treatments could be used to treat or even prevent autoimmune disease, and indeed some are already in Phase 1 clinical trials. However before embarking on large and expensive trials evaluating the effectiveness of such agents, the issue of whether viral pathogens trigger autoimmune disease needs to be established convincingly. The overall aim of this project is to investigate a possible causal link between six ubiquitous human viruses and the development of four autoimmune diseases using a statistical genetics methodology that is robust to confounding and reverse causality, and will be able to provide evidence in favour or against a role of viral infection in disease aetiology. Our approach involves finding genetic variants associated with antibody response to viral infection and determining whether the same variants also affect risk of autoimmune disease using a technique called Mendelian randomization. Should our results be consistent with a causal relationship, we expect that approaches aimed at controlling viral infection through vaccination, antiviral drugs or treatment with virus-specific T cell

infusions may become effective treatments or preventative strategies against autoimmune diseases in the future. Equally important, should we find no evidence for a causal relationship, then our results would suggest that expensive clinical trials involving anti-viral agents and/or vaccines to these pathogens are unlikely to succeed and shouldn’t be conducted- potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars by avoiding costly studies likely to fail.",null,"Tuesday, 22 August, 2017","Wednesday, 23 August, 2017","Genetics, Autoimmunity, GWAS, Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc."

Stress can initiate biological processes that increase risk for both types of problems in children but no study has yet examined inflammation as the stress-induced biological process that can increase this risk. Inflammation is typically thought of as the body’s primary response to physical injury or infection. However, there is now substantial evidence that stress can also trigger significant increases in inflammatory activity which may account for how external stressors ‘get under the skin’. Increases in inflammation can in turn elicit profound changes in behaviour, which include the initiation of symptoms such as sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue and social and behavioural withdrawal. This project will examine, for the first time, the role of stress-induced inflammation in childhood in the aetiology and maintenance of emotional and behavioural problems from childhood to adolescence. This is the main aim of this project, which we will meet using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a UK study of more than 14,000 pregnant women in 1991-2, the children arising from the pregnancy, and their partners. Adverse life events will be measured at both the prenatal and the childhood period, in view of the evidence that prenatal and childhood adversity can affect children through different mechanisms. We will also explore the complex ways in which events may interact to predict child outcomes, investigate the importance of distinguishing events by type (e.g., dependent vs independent; chronic vs episodic), and examine the role of their perceived impact. Emotional and behavioural problems will be measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at ages around 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 16 years.

Dental fear can result from negative experiences, but different individuals also have differing genetic susceptibility to dental fear and the condition is around 30% heritable. Despite this, there is limited understanding of the genetics of dental fear, probably because few large studies have measured dental fear using a validated index. Within ALSPAC dental fear was measured using the Corah anxiety scale at age 17.5 years.

ALSPAC has been invited to join a new consortium investigating the genetics of dental fear, which may shed new light on the biology of dental fear or novel ways to identify individuals at risk.

A better understanding of the development of aggressive behavior and the underlying neural circuits will allow for the development of interventions and targeted treatments for excessive aggression found in psychiatric disorders. From recent basic science research, using a novel transgenic mouse model we recently identified a developmental sensitive period for the effect of 5-HT1BR on aggression. Specifically, alterations in 5-HT1BR signaling during the peri-pubertal period lead to increased impulsive aggression in mice throughout life.

There is very little knowledge on what could explain the high comorbidity between PTSD and psychosis, and more specifically the mechanisms/pathways that may explain why trauma may lead to psychotic symptoms, PTSD or to a combination of both. To date, the literature has focused on two main hypotheses: a) PTSD stands as a mediator of the relationship between childhood trauma and psychotic symptom severity. A model of continuity has also been suggested, implying that psychotic symptoms would be an exacerbation of the PTSD symptoms and b) PTSD and psychosis are both part of a broader spectrum of reactions to trauma with similar explanatory mechanisms at the level of cognitive schemas (e.g. beliefs about self and others), attributional styles and dissociative processes. There is a paucity of empirical evidence evaluating either of these hypotheses. Examining clinical and cognitive profiles of adults with psychotic experiences, with and without preceding PTSD (after childhood trauma) would be the first step towards disentangling complex relationship between the two disorders.","The course of the illness, prognosis and treatment for psychosis (i.e. schizophrenia) and PTSD are very different, therefore, advancing knowledge on this complex relationship between psychosis and PTSD after childhood trauma is crucial in guiding targeted clinical interventions.","Friday, 24 May, 2019","Tuesday, 28 May, 2019","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, PTSD, psychosis, cognition"

Indoor tanning, defined as the use of an ultraviolet emission device to produce a cosmetic tan1, has been associated with increased risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and thus has been classified as a group I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer2. Despite the risk posed by this activity, indoor tanning is common practice among young people in developed countries. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies of indoor tanning and NMSC showed that ever exposure to indoor tanning was associated with a higher risk of both, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, and that exposure at a young age (< 25 years of age) increased these risks considerably1. Since indoor tanning is a potentially modifiable exposure to UVR it would be relevant to examine its frequency and the characteristics of its users in the ALSPAC cohort. For the most part ALSPAC has not included questions regarding indoor tanning. The exceptions are the mother’s ‘Your environment’ questionnaire administered in early gestation asking how often they had used a sun bed or lamp during their pregnancy, and the child-based KN questionnaire at 69 months old asking about ever use of sun bed or lamp and its frequency.

Left untreated both can result in delays in learning, social isolation, poor self-esteem, communication difficulties and problems performing daily living activities.

No literature exists to suggest whether a link exists between these two common childhood problems. However, literature does confirm and reinforce the role of vision in speech perception and auditory visual speech perception, both of which are precursors for speech development. It is therefore hypothesized that children with a vision impairment in early life would be more likely to have speech impairment and/or delay in the development of speech.

This research aims to investigate this hypothesis. This will be done through review of the ALSPAC data relating to speech and vision, assessment of the speech of a cohort of children with known vision impairment and the vision of those children referred to speech and language therapy.

If a link exists between vision impairment and speech then evaluation of the type of speech impairment can be made, thus assisting in understanding the nature of speech development in children with a vision impairment.

Identifying the presence of a link between vision impairment and speech impairment would enable practitioners to more readily identify each.

It is the most common form of violence in women which constitutes a major public health problem worldwide. The current explanatory theories of IPV perpetration can be summarized as feminist/sociocultural, social learning theory-based intergenerational transmission and psychological/psychosocial. According to the feminist/sociocultural theory, domestic violence is a consequence of âpatriarchyâ. From this view, violence is used as a form of power and control of women by men. The intergenerational transmission theory asserts that domestic violence is based on the exposure to, or observation of, violence in the family of origin. Psychological theories propose that there are psychological, psychiatric, behavioural and neurological risk factors for domestic violence perpetration. In the study of IPV perpetration, it is important to consider the variables addressed by such theories as a whole and from a developmental perspective and there is no study that simultaneously considers all the variables of these explanatory theories. The general aim of our study is to identify those etiological mechanisms linking risk factors for IPV perpetration across development. This study will be the first one that sheds light on which the origins of IPV perpetration are by knowing how IPV perpetration develops. Implications in terms of prevention and treatment will be of a great relevance for public health.","Considering the high prevalence and negative consequences of IPV, its prevention is of great importance to public health. Moreover, there is a scarcity of studies that address IPV perpetration from a prospective approach and using large samples. In this line, it is the first study that simultaneously considers all the variables of the current explanatory theories of IPV perpetration (e.g., feminist/sociocultural, social learning theory-based intergenerational transmission and psychological/psychosocial) from a prospective perspective. The further investigation of the current explanatory theories of IPV perpetration using a fully prospective design would benefit in the comprehension of IPV perpetration. Regarding the public health significance of the present research, we expect to identify which variables differentiate IPV perpetrators from those who do not show IPV perpetration. Such investigation will be useful in the treatment and prevention of IPV since we will determine for the first time, the etiological mechanisms involved in IPV perpetration.","Wednesday, 21 March, 2018",null,"Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Statistical methods, Psychology - personality"

Of concern is a possible role of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) in dysregulating the number of follicles or in promoting depletion of the follicle pool.  EDCs have been detected in human ovarian follicular fluid.  In addition, concentrations of certain EDCs detected in cord blood and amniotic fluid from pregnant women suggest human fetal exposure and the possibility of follicular alterations beginning at an early developmental stage.  To date, the literature assessing potential human effects of exposure to environmental EDCs on markers of ovarian reserve, such as anti-mÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH), is sparse.  Our goal is to contribute to current knowledge by conducting secondary analysis of data collected in female adolescents participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to assess the association of prenatal exposure to PFAS and organochlorine pesticides with AMH concentrations.  We will also assess temporal changes in AMH concentrations in relation to these exposures.

The covid-19 pandemic potentially threatens to worsen these health inequalities. The âlockdownâ changed peopleâs behaviour radically, but the socioeconomic differences in these experiences are not well understood. Some groups of society may have increased health-promoting behaviours â for example, engaging in more physical activity and preparing more food within the home. Other groups may have experienced adverse changes in health-related behaviours â for example, smoking more or consuming more alcohol in response to the stress and anxiety induced by the pandemic. It is possible these differences are socioeconomically patterned, and could therefore worsen pre-existing inequalities. Another key factor likely to influence patterns of behaviour change during the pandemic is household/family structure.

Such novel integrated research can inform us on health strategies to prevent obesity.

Although linked more-variables-than-samples (called high-dimensional) multi-source data form an extremely rich resource for research, extracting meaningful and integrated information is challenging and not appropriately addressed by current statistical methods: A first problem is that relevant information is hidden in a bulk of irrelevant variables. Second, the sources are often very heterogeneous, which may obscure apparent links between the shared mechanisms. A statistical framework is needed to select the relevant groups of variables within each source and link them throughout data sources. In this project we develop a new framework by extending principal component analysis to common components defined by relevant clusters of variables. We use it both for exploration and outcome modelling of linked high-dimensional social sciences and (epi)genetic data.

The advanced component analysis method will be a widely applicable and novel method for knowledge extraction also allowing for more accurate predictions in many social science contexts with big data.

Eating disorders are also common, affecting over one-in-twenty adolescent girls. Both self-harm and eating disorders are linked to early death.

Up to half of those with an eating disorder also self-harm. However, we know little about why these mental health conditions often occur together.

One reason might be that some risk factors for eating disorders and self-harm are the same.  One characteristic, seen in both conditions, is difficulty managing emotions. However, we do not know whether individuals with an eating disorder find managing emotions difficult because they have an eating disorder, or whether difficulty managing emotions is one of the reasons they develop an eating disorder. Similar gaps in our knowledge exist in relation to people who engage in self-harm; we do not know for certain whether difficulties managing emotions occur before self-harming behaviour starts.  One study in adolescents in China suggests difficulty in managing emotions leads to later self-harm, however, little else is known about this area. It is also likely that a number of other factors link difficulties in managing emotions with later self-harm and eating disorders.  These factors include difficulties in understanding social situations, difficulties in reading facial expressions, and the experience of being bullied.

To enhance our understanding about the development of self-harm and eating disorders, we have assembled a team of outstanding scientists from two universities.

We will conduct an analysis of existing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). ALSPAC is a study of over 13,000 children born in and around Bristol in 1991-1992 and followed up since birth with regular questionnaires and clinics. Very few studies have such a large number of people, with such detailed questions collected over time. We will use ALSPAC data to study whether early childhood difficulties in managing emotions is associated with later self-harm and eating disorders. We will also use it to investigate whether ability to understand social situations, to recognise emotions, or the experience of being bullied, are involved in the relationship between difficulties in managing emotions and later self-harm and eating disorders","1) Scientific advancement and impact upon the research community:
The aim of this research is to enhance understanding about the aetiology of eating disorders and self-harm, and particularly how they relate to a common precursor of emotional dysregulation. Given that the personal and economic burden of eating disorders and self-harm is substantial, there is a pressing need for more effective strategies for treatment and prevention. We envisage that the research will assist in the identification of novel treatment targets, as well as potential prognostic markers.  
2) Service users and families:
Ultimately, we hope that the research will contribute to better prevention and treatment strategies for people who self-harm and also those with eating disorders.  In doing so, we hope that it will help to reduce the suffering and accelerate the recovery of people with these common and burdensome mental health conditions. Increasing understanding of the aetiology of these conditions will, we think, also help to reduce the stigma associated with them. 
3) Clinical community:
Our findings could lead to the identification of early markers of self-harm and eating disorders risk. This would aid the early identification of young people who are at increased risk of self-harm and eating disorders and enable more efficient targeting of resources to those who are most in need, and most likely to benefit from early intervention. In addition, a better understanding of underlying mediators such as bullying, social cognition and emotion recognition will enable the development of successful novel treatment strategies. 
4) Development of capacity and capability:
The project will support the career development of a talented new PI in the field of eating disorder research (HB), also enabling her to broaden her research experience into the area of self-harm. Our proposal brings together an outstanding multidisciplinary team of academic experts who will be supporting HB throughout the project. Such a partnership is extremely rare, and the infrastructural funding underpinning this partnership will potentially allow our team to develop further competitive proposals tackling the issue of self-harm and eating disorders.
In addition, the two researchers employed on the study will develop new skills through the analysis, write-up and presentation of study findings.  These skills will be invaluable in terms of their future career development.","Tuesday, 15 October, 2019","Tuesday, 15 October, 2019","Clinical research/clinical practice, Eating disorders - anorexia, bulimia, Statistical methods, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics"

The prevalence of acne in adolescents has been reported as being between 35% and 90%, depending on the method of classification, with peak incidence occurring at between 14 and 17 years in females, and 16 and 19 years in males (Stathakis et al, 1997; Kilkenny et al. 1998). As well as the physical pain and discomfort that acne produces, it is well documented that acne sufferers experience higher levels of psychological distress, are more self-conscious and have a poorer self-image than age-matched controls. A possible role for genetic factors in the development of acne is based on the observation that relatives of affected individuals are at increased risk of developing acne compared with unrelated individuals. However, related individuals share similar environments as well as genes. By using the classical twin design which compares the similarity of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs with that of dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs I was able to show previously that acne is a highly heritable trait (Evans et al. 2005).",null,"Wednesday, 23 June, 2010","Wednesday, 23 June, 2010","Genetics, Skin"

One possible mechanism is that a caesarean as opposed to a vaginal birth, results in differences in the nature of bacteria in the intestines, as passing through the birth canal offers an important source of bacteria to populate the gut. There is increasing evidence that the central and the enteric nervous system (controls the gastrointestinal system), communicate in a bidirectional manner by neural, endocrine and immune mechanisms to the extent that the enteric nervous system has been described as the ""second brain"". As the nature of the diet also plays a major role in the defining the bacterial composition of the gut, the objective is to consider whether it is possible to use diet to either potentiate or reduce the consequences of the type of birth?  A related question is whether taking an anti-biotic, that inevitably influences the bacteria in the gut, has long-term consequences?  It is known, for example, that the taking of anti-biotics increases the rate of growth.  Similarly the interaction between taking anti-biotics and diet will be examined.   Several aspects of diet will be considered, for example it is known that the fibre content of the diet and the consumption of high levels of fat and protein, amongst other dimensions of diet, have implications for the number and nature of the bacteria in the gut with consequences for inflammation.",null,"Tuesday, 20 December, 2016","Thursday, 19 January, 2017","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Allergy, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Obesity, Birth outcomes, BMI, Breast feeding, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Development, Intelligence - memory, Nutrition - breast feeding, diet"

the symptoms of depression improve overall after long term antidepressant use, but this is reported

in tandem with adverse psychological and physical health outcomes like weight gain, sexual

impoverished understanding of depression causality, with multiple competing hypotheses

Poor quality diet is the top contributor to mortality globally, and is estimated to cost the NHS Â£6billion per year.

The period of adolescence to early adulthood is the time when prevalence of overweight and obesity develops most rapidly, making this an important time to understand the contribution of diet to these developing risk factors. Adolescence and early adulthood is a time of rapid personal development and changing lifestyles. It also is the time when adult behaviours, including adult dietary patterns, are developed and established.  Understanding the factors that influence development of adult diet is an important first step in developing strategies to change behaviour.

However, there has been little assessment of diet in young adults.  Online tools (INTAKE24) are now available that make reporting on nutritional intake easier, allowing online completion of recalls of daily intake, and automated data processing. These validated tools make the collection of diet data in large samples more feasible, and are now being implemented in large-scale dietary surveys across many countries by researchers at the MRC Epidemiology Unit.

This application focusses on assessing the diet of young adults (age 28-30) in the ALSPAC cohort. This data will then be used together with other data collected within ALSPAC, or from linked datasets, to understand (1) the changes in environment and lifestyle which help to explain why individuals have adopted their current diets, and (2) the relationships between diet and measures of heart and blood health. The data will also be available for further research studying associations between diet at age 30 years and longer term measures of health and disease.","There is limited robust data available on dietary intake during early adulthood, both globally and in the UK. Collection of this data will allow research which helps us to understand the role of diet within pathways which lead from socioeconomic determinants to cardiovascular and metabolic disease. In particular this research will provide information on the populations at risk for development of poor diet during early adulthood, and suggest opportunities for public health intervention. For example research based on this data could identify particular population groups or particular early adulthood life transitions that increase risk of a poor quality diet, suggesting a particular target for intervention.  In the future this data will allow for further research addressing associations between diet in early adulthood and later health and disease, for example to understand whether diet in early adulthood plays an independent role in future disease risk.","Tuesday, 17 September, 2019","Tuesday, 17 September, 2019","Epidemiology, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, Nutrition - breast feeding, diet"

This comes at enormous personal, societal and economic cost. I and others have previously shown that a decrease in heart function is associated with early cognitive impairment, however the underlying cause is not clear. It is possible that poor heart function may lead to poor blood flow in the brain, which may be the link. Another possible link between the heart and the brain runs in the opposite direction. Instead of heart problems leading to brain problems, it could be that lower cognitive function as a child leads to heart problems later in life. I will investigate the direction of the heart-brain association in 30yr olds from the ALSPAC cohort, that have had data collected since birth, including genetic, cognitive and heart measures. I will collect new detailed data on the heart and the brain during rest and during exercise. The results of this study are important as dementia is a public health priority. The clinical implications of reduced cognition among people with impaired heart function are considerable. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, we can reduce the burden of both of these conditions.","Dementia is the greatest global health and social challenge in current times, there is no cure and its impact is devastating, but it does not have to be an inevitable consequence of aging. If we can understand the mechanisms then we can intervene and prevent/delay its effects. I propose that there is a bidirectional association between cognition and cardiovascular disease and by applying sophisticated methodologies and techniques to assess cardiac and brain function and haemodynamics, and by applying a life-course approach, this investigation will significantly advance our understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying both cardiac and cognitive decline. No previous study has assessed the heart-brain connection during dynamic testing in this age group or with a bi-directional, RbG approach before.

The basic postulation is that very early childhood social interactions with primary caregivers are internalised to create and maintain conscious and unconscious mental representations of the self and others. These form the basis of âattachment stylesâ, which have an impact on close relationships and ability to regulate emotions. There is extensive evidence that attachment style is a predictor of coping strategies, adjustment in response to stressors and therefore a vulnerability to mental health problems (see Mikulincer & Shaver 2012 for a review). Research has widely demonstrated an association between secure attachment style and well-being and positive mental health, whilst both insecure attachment styles (anxious and avoidant) have been associated with poor relationship quality, psychological vulnerability and maladjustment, and mental health difficulties (e.g. Sroufe et al., 1999; Hankin et al., 2005; Mikulincer & Shaver 2007; Groh 2016; Spruit 2019). However, the direction of causality is less well established as most studies rely on cross-sectional design and measure attachment style as a discrete variable at a single point in adulthood.","This research will be able to determine whether there is a prospective relationship between attachment style in childhood and mental health outcomes of depression and self-harm at 18 years of age, helping identify if this is a causal link or what the key confounders are in this relationship. This has significant implications for nature and timing of interventions to target attachment styles or other factors, to inform an effective public health response, including parenting programmes, psychological intervention, or school and social environments.","Friday, 17 July, 2020","Monday, 20 July, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Attachment style, Statistical methods, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Parenting, Psychology - personality"

The aim of this project is to apply this method to data from participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Comparison of these measures with other puberty assessments: age of menarche for girls, and for boys and girls, assessments of puberty based on questionnaires in which the child's parent or guardian was asked to identify which line-drawing most closely resembled the child. This method describes 'Tanner'stages ranging between I and V, with I being least sexually mature.

We hypothesise that there will be more genetic variants associated with fetal growth to be identified if parental origin of the allele is taken into account. Therefore, we would like to carry out a genome-wide search for genetic variants in assocition with fetal growth considering parental origin effects.

Because many individual differences that are important for health are believed to emerge in early childhood, research has focused on identifying individual and environmental variables that may impact basal and stress-reactive HPA axis activity. Elements of the early home environment such as financial strain, family turmoil, exposure to violence, and maternal depression have emerged as reliable predictors of basal cortisol (the primary hormonal product of the HPA axis) in childhood (Essex, Klein, Cho, & Kalin, 2002; Evans 2003; Flinn & England, 1997; Saridjan et al., 2010). However, prior research has primarily used concurrent or retrospective designs and therefore the longitudinal effects of early environmental risk on basal cortisol are relatively unknown. Although some important individual differences in HPA axis activity and development are likely due to genetic differences, studies examining genetic contributions to basal cortisol have found inconsistent results. Some studies suggest that genes such as SLC6A4, COMT, and MAOA may contribute to HPA axis regulation in adults (Brummett et al., 2008; Jabbi et al., 2007, Wust et al., 2009). Developmental research has also found main effects for SLC6A4 on basal cortisol in 9-14 year olds (Chen, Joormann, Hallmayer, & Gotlib, 2009). Interestingly, published work (including papers utilizing ALSPAC data) examining associations among these polymorphisms and mental health in children has often reported null results (Araya et al., 2008; Evans et al., 2008; Haberstick et al., 2005; Munafo, Durrant, Lewis, & Flint, 2009). Both theoretical models and limited prior research suggest that early effects of these polymorphisms on health may occur via a meditational process, such as through differences in HPA axis regulation. Thus genetic and early environmental risk may contribute to HPA axis dysregulation in childhood, which may then contribute to poorer health outcomes. However this meditational model needs to be assessed more thoroughly to extend environmental findings and replicate genetic associations.",null,"Thursday, 9 December, 2010","Thursday, 9 December, 2010","Cortisol, Genetics"

Dysfunction of the maternally inherited mitochondrial genome leads to oxidative stress, and the genome is copy-number variable, with more copies in tissues with higher energy requirements. Damage to both telomeric and mitochondrial DNA contributes to cell signalling via p53-mediated pathways, leading to cellular senescence and apoptosis (programmed cell death). Telomere shortening, and mitochondrial dysfunction are therefore known mechanisms of cellular ageing, and recent studies have suggested that mtDNA copy number and leucocyte telomere length (LTL) may be related (Passos et al., Sahin et al.). Telomere length is related to diseases involving accelerated ageing, including those in which inflammation, oxidative stress and disordered cell turnover have been proposed as important: such diseases are cardiovascular disease (Haycock et al.), respiratory disease (Albrecht et al.), and putatively, psychosis (Nieratschker et al). Whilst classical risk factors related to these diseases may also associate with LTL/mtDNA copy number, inflammation may act as a global risk factor for them all, and LTL/mtDNA copy number may mediate these associations (Masi et al.).",null,"Tuesday, 23 September, 2014","Thursday, 11 December, 2014",Mitochondria

Recently, methods have been introduced to identify the effects of âgenetic nurtureâ - effects of the parentally-provided environment which can be explained by the parentsâ genes through their influences on parental behavior (rather than through genetic transmission to their children). We have developed an extension of these methods which may allow us to find specific genetic factors which make up this effect, for nuclear families with genotype data available on at least 2 members (e.g., sibling pairs or parent-offspring pairs). This method involves imputing missing parental genotypes from the available genotypes of each nuclear family.  Because of its detailed longitudinal phenotype data and genotyped mothers and children, ALSPAC is an ideal dataset to examine these effects across a number of traits important to human health and disease.

A major impetus for conducting this research is the finding from the ALSPAC cohort that compliance with this advisory appears to be associated with greater risks of the specific harms (e.g. suboptimal verbal development) it was designed to prevent. This prior analysis, conducted as a collaboration between LMBB/NIAAA/ NIH and ALSPAC, compared dietary intakes during pregnancy estimated by food frequency questionnaire data, to childhood developmental outcome data. The findings of lower than expected verbal IQ and other suboptimal outcomes such as poor fine motor development and adverse socialization among the cohort, do not appear to be attributable to confounding variables. This increased risk of suboptimal developmental outcomes may be due to deficiencies in nutrients uniquely rich in seafood, potentially the long chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA). Several lines of evidence indicate that insufficient dietary intakes of EPA and DHA increase the risk of neurodevelopmental impairments. Among these are that DHA is selectively concentrated into neuronal tissues and the proliferation of neuronal dendrites and synapses is substantially enhanced by DHA. Since the main source of DHA-EPA for humans comes from the dietary intake of fish & seafood (or fish oil dietary supplements) the evaluation of food frequency data from the ALSPAC cohort indicates that pregnant women need a sufficient intake of DHA-EPA in order to prevent increasing risk of suboptimal outcomes among their offspring. Another nutrient uniquely rich in seafood, selenium has a protective effect against mercury in utero in animal experiments. As selenium is fairly high in most marine fish/seafood, there could be a natural offsetting of the dietary ingestion of methylmercury present in marine fish/seafood versus the selenium present in the marine fish/seafood. Selenium is thought to bind with and detoxify methyl-mercury and a greater ratio of methyl-mercury to selenium is thought to indicate that the primary protective mechanism against methyl-mercury toxicity has been overwhelmed. However, the impact of this relationship in humans needs to be evaluated as previous research on mercury or methylmercury may be inherently flawed as selenium was not simultaneously considered with the mercury.",null,"Tuesday, 1 November, 2005","Tuesday, 1 November, 2005","Nutrition, Cognition"

A scientific hypothesis is that genetic variants influence complex traits via affecting cellular traits, e.g., regulating gene expression and altering protein abundance. Yet, how to systematically examine this hypothesis remains an open problem.

Recently, large genomic consortia are generating a vast volume of genomic data towards comprehensively characterizing the regulatory role of genetic variants. For example, the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) has collected genomic profile of 449 individuals, comprised of measurements of gene expression from multiple tissues and about 12.5 million DNA bases, providing unprecedented opportunities to dissect genetic contributions to complex traits. Statistical methods that effectively harness multilayer data (genetic variants, cellular traits and organismal traits) for mechanistic interpretation are highly demanding. The phenomenon that genetic variants have individually weak effects on complex traits makes statistical modeling very challenging, because it requires that the developed models can efficiently exploit information in low signal-noise-ratio (SNR) regimes.

In the proposed research, we aim at developing statistical methods to advance mechanistic understanding of the role of associated variants in complex traits. The key idea is built upon the emerging scientific evidence that genetic effects at the cellular level are much stronger than those at the organismal level. In our pilot study, we proposed a statistical approach, AUDIS, to accounting for uncertainty in dissecting genetic contributions to complex traits by leveraging regulatory information. We also developed a parameter expanded expectation-maximization (PX-EM) algorithm to ensure that AUDIS can perform stably in low SNR regimes. Interestingly, two popular methods in this field, SKAT and PrediXcan can be connected via a stagewise view of AUDIS, as supported by results from comprehensive simulation studies. Then we applied stagewise AUDIS to analyze 20 complex traits in GERA by incorporating the transcriptome data in the Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) Project. Real data analysis results show that AUDIS can identify more genetically regulated genes that are significantly associated with complex traits, without inflated type I errors. To continue in this promising direction, we propose generalized AUDIS models to allow detection of trait-associated expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), as well as integrative analysis of GWAS data with transcriptome data from multiple tissues. We also propose to investigate theoretical properties of our methods, e.g., why AUDIS can be immune to model mis-specification.

The novelty of this research is that a statistically efficient and computationally feasible framework is developed to dissect genetic contributions to complex traits. Specifically, the proposed methods (AUDIS and its generalizations) can effectively borrow regulatory information at the cellular level and then boost statistical power of identifying genetically-regulated and trait-associated genes, even though in low SNR regimes. The stagewise view of AUDIS not only offers a statistical connection between existing approaches, but also highlights the importance of statistically rigorous design. Unlike conventional engineering approaches that often only consider a point estimate or a maximum a posteriori probability estimate, the stagewise view of AUDIS implies that the posterior distribution obtained in former stage should be naturally incorporated as the prior in the later stage. This gives birth to a modularized design of the whole data analytics system, greatly helping biomedical researchers to gain new scientific insights. The statistical and computational skills developed here are also broadly useful to many other applications in the field of data science.","The impact of our research will lie on two sides. First, we will develop statistically rigorous methods to conduct integrative analysis of multi-platform genetic/genomic data. Second, the results from our analysis will help people better understand the mechanistic link that genetic variants influence complex traits via affecting cellular  traits.","Tuesday, 16 April, 2019","Tuesday, 30 April, 2019","Bioinformatics, Bone disorders - arthritis, osteoporosis, Developmental disorders - autism, Cancer, Diabetes, Eating disorders - anorexia, bulimia, Eczema, Hypertension, Mental health, Obesity, Computer simulations/modelling/algorithms, GWAS, Medical imaging, Statistical methods, Statistical methods"

Vitamin D enables normal bone mineralization and prevents hypocalcemic tetany. It is also necessary for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Vitamin D deficiency is common and typically arises from inadequate intake, inadequate sunlight exposure, and limited absorption or conversion into active metabolites (often due to liver or kidney disorders). Recent studies suggest that vitamin D influences various health conditions (such as diabetes, heart disease and hypertension) and mortality. Accumulating evidence also suggests previously unsuspected roles for vitamin D in brain development and neuroprotection. Recent population-based studies link vitamin D deficiency in old age with cognitive function cross-sectionally (Buell, et al., 2009; Lee, et al., 2009; Llewellyn, et al., 2009) and prospectively (Llewellyn, et al., in review).

Loneliness has a detrimental impact on health and wellbeing, however existing studies largely focus on older adults, meaning the full impact in young adults is unclear. Of particular concern is the likely adoption of negative health behaviours (including addictions), the harmful overuse or underuse of NHS services, and potential for self-harm or suicide in young adults experiencing loneliness. Also, of concern is the negative impact on milestones such as finishing school, further education and getting a first job, which contribute to household wealth and wellbeing. This research aims at using the ALSPAC data to assess the impact and cost of young adult loneliness in the UK with respect to health status, over or under use of health care resources, education attainment and unemployment. Regression analysis will identify correlations between variables, while causal relationships will be investigated through instrumental variable analysis and propensity score matching. Results will be used to update existing costs estimates that have focused only on older adults. Analysis will be conducted on data before, during and after COVID-19 to consider the prevalence and impact of young adult loneliness through COVID-19, given the likely exacerbation of loneliness in the context of social distancing. This research will develop understanding and inspire greater consideration of loneliness in young adults promoting cross-sector involvement and improved support.","This research aims at understanding the impact and cost of young adult loneliness on public health, NHS resources and the wider economy. Given current rates of loneliness in this group of the population and the fact that previous literature has focused mainly exclusively in older population this piece of research will complement what we know about loneliness and fill the gap in the literature. We also hope that the results of this research will help improve our understanding of loneliness in young adults and have the evidence to help building a case for greater awareness of loneliness and for encouraging future research in this age group. It will also promote the need for cross-sector action where effects are observed in health, education and wider economic sectors. In turn this will promote happier and healthier young adults where the negative consequences of loneliness are reduced as a result of greater understanding and attention from policymakers and more targeted support.","Friday, 17 July, 2020","Monday, 20 July, 2020","Health Economics, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Methods - e.g. cross cohort analysis, data mining, mendelian randomisation, etc."

PCOS is a complex genetic trait which arises from a combination of genetic risk and environmental such as obesity. Currently, a conclusive diagnosis of PCOS cannot be made until sexual maturation is complete and the patient develops the characteristic diagnostic features of hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, and/or polycystic ovarian morphology. However, studies in girls with increased risk for PCOS, including daughters of affected women and girls with obesity, have identified early reproductive and metabolic features of the syndrome even prior to the onset of puberty. Investigations into the early origins of PCOS have been limited by small sample size and lack of longitudinal data. The ALSPAC cohort includes critical data needed to investigate PCOS, including maternal reproductive histories, hormone levels, and offspring pubertal development, reproductive hormone levels, and menstrual histories. These proposal seeks to identify early clinical and genetic predictors of PCOS. Data collected in this project will be used for preliminary data in planned future  innovative investigations of the early origins of PCOS.  This study will propose using a translational approach integrating whole genome sequencing, epigenetic, and metabolomics data available in this cohort with clinical predictors of PCOS.  This proposed research will have a sustained and lasting impact on the field as it will inform future efforts toward development of targeted prevention and early treatment approaches in at-risk girls.","The proposed research will generate critical preliminary data required for a planned future extramural application aiming to employ this rich data source for innovative investigations of the early origins of PCOS.

Given that 70% of the worldâs population will live in urban areas by 2050, it is essential that we uncover the pathways linking cities and psychosis so that we can inform intervention efforts.","This research will serve a range of stakeholders, including researchers, industry, policymakers, and the general public. Air pollution is a known cause of physical disease, but very little is known about the impact of air pollution on mental health problems. My research will contribute to the evidence base on air pollution and mental health, which is essential for policymakers to make the economic case for tightening air pollution restrictions. Though a major global challenge, urban expansion nevertheless provides a unique opportunity for promoting healthy urban design. My research will also be useful to industry and policymakers to provide evidence on targets in the urban environment that could be modified to improve mental health. By identifying modifiable targets in the urban environment, this research has the strong potential to improve the mental health of urban residents now and for years to come. My plan for maximising impact of the findings is as follows:

1)	I expect that the research proposed will lead directly to at least four publications in highly regarded journals with a broad readership. 
2)	I will disseminate findings via oral presentations at six international psychiatry/epidemiology conferences that attract a wide audience such as MQ Mental Health Science Meeting.
3)	I will liaise with press teams such as the Science Media Centre to maximise the impact of the findings through press releases and press briefings.
4)	I will ensure that findings are clearly presented to the public by preparing blogs and podcasts, and by participating in interactive open workshops and talks.
5)	I will share my findings with policymakers by holding a policy lab with support from Policy Bristol.","Wednesday, 8 May, 2019","Thursday, 9 May, 2019","Epidemiology, Mental health, Statistical methods, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution"

However, the measurement and analysis of diet in longitudinal epidemiological studies is extremely challenging. An individualâs diet is the result of the current zeitgeist, their social, economic and cultural circumstances and, it varies in relation to age (2, 4, 5).  A personâs dietary intake will also vary according to season, day of week and has considerable random variation (6). The aim in epidemiological studies is to capture an individualâs consistent long-term diet in the context of this variation. Objective measures of dietary intake, such as direct observation, are costly and carry significant participant and researcher burden (7). Therefore self-reported measures of dietary intake have been developed. A number of these are used in the CLOSER cohorts e.g. food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) in ALSPAC, National Child & Development Study (NCDS), 1970 British birth cohort (BCS70), Southampton Women's Survey (SWS), Hertfordshire cohort study (HCS) and diet diaries in National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), ALSPAC and SWS.  However, it remains difficult to accurately capture habitual dietary intake, and there is always the possibility of over- or under-reporting (7).  Validation studies of these instruments in EPIC-Norfolk demonstrated that correlation between dietary biomarkers and a 7-day food diary was better than correlation with an FFQ (8, 9).  However, each of these methods also have specific pros and cons. For example, FFQs can capture foods consumed irregularly but reporting is limited to the items contained in the food list designed for the study (7). In food diaries, all food consumed at the time of consumption is recorded, but it may miss foods not eaten regularly (7). Within-method differences e.g. a 3-day food diary versus a 7-day food diary adds to heterogeneity in dietary measurement. Results from each method can therefore be slightly different. For example, one study found that macronutrient estimates from FFQs are higher compared with estimates from a 7-day or 16-day food diary using data from EPIC-Norfolk (8).  In ALSPAC, slightly different dietary patterns in childhood were produced depending on the dietary assessment used (10).",null,"Friday, 1 September, 2017","Wednesday, 6 September, 2017",Epidemiology

The aim of interactive play is that it encompasses two key elements â a positive interaction between caregiver and infant, and promotion of healthy movement behaviours in the child. From my formative work, I have been able to explore and develop novel methodology for objectively measuring infant movement using 24-hour accelerometry, and have consequently been able to measure and interpret detailed physical activity over a seven-day period in this population. Caregiver-infant interactions have primarily been measured using questionnaires or third party observation; however, these measures are limited by their subjectivity and intrusiveness. First person observation using headcams provide more comprehensive measures of caregiver-infant interaction, and the analysis of these measures has been optimised by Dr Pearson (Bristol, UK). Even with these novel ways of assessing movement and caregiver-infant interaction, I still need to determine relationships between these two behaviours, as well as optimal levels of interactive play. This project proposes to add accelerometry to a subsample of the ALSPAC-G2 cohort, in which headcams are already being used. This will be replicated by the cohort I am establishing in South Africa in order to allow for cross-context comparisons.",Development of an interactive play measure will allow for intervention design and potential improved growth and development trajectories for children.,"Friday, 9 November, 2018","Tuesday, 13 November, 2018","Early childhood development , Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Obesity, Headcam

Furthermore, there is emerging evidence of a possible link between human and companion animal obesity, since overweight owners are more likely to own overweight dogs (Holmes et al, 2007). Given that the prevalence of childhood obesity is greater in families where mothers are heavier (Hawkins & Law 2006), there may be close associations between the causes of obesity in both children and companion animals. This is, perhaps, not surprising since the owner-pet relationship is similar to that between parent and child (Berryman et al., 1985).

Ample evidence suggests that exposure to childhood adversity, such as experiences of violence, parent imprisonment, household mental illness or substance use, has harmful effects on cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases. Experiencing two or more adversities is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease in Europe and North America, respectively, corresponding to US$150 and US$164 billion in associated costs. Whilst there is evidence that adverse childhood experiences are associated with higher cardiovascular risk, whether socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular risk might be explained by childhood adversities. Understanding the extent to which adverse experiences in childhood could potentially explain socioeconomic inequities in CVD risk would help to inform the targeting of resources.","Findings have important practical implications, by informing the extent to which both positive and adverse experiences need to be considered if we are to promote cardiovascular health through childhood. Better understanding of modifiable resilience factors could provide targets for interventions to improve outcomes for children who may face adversity in the future or have experienced past adversities; offer important insights into the mechanisms underlying the relationships between childhood adversity and outcomes, and improve the tailoring of interventions to those who can most benefit from them.

For ethical, practical, or financial reasons, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate such an effect may not be possible and inferences must be drawn from observational data. These may be distorted by reverse causation, measurement errors, or the presence of socioeconomic and behavioural confounding factors that are difficult to measure even if known. Mendelian randomization is an instrumental variable (IV) method that permits estimation of the exposure-outcome causal effect in the presence of confounding. The assumptions required, i.e. all variables are continuous and all relationships between variables are linear, are often violated in epidemiological applications where the outcome (e.g. disease status) is typically binary and hence cannot have a linear relationship with the exposure. This is especially relevant to case-control data where the exposure-outcome relationship is usually logistic. The aim of this project is to develop theoretically sound methods for dealing with non-linear models and to investigate the practical implications of weakening, or even violating, some of the more restrictive conditions, given the type of data that we expect to arise in these settings. Theory must inform practice but applications should drive the theoretical investigation.

However, the field of human genetics is increasingly recognising that genetic variation acquired during life (i.e., post-zygotic changes) (3).  A recent study by Dumanski et al. found that men who smoke are thrice more likely to show post-zygotic loss of Y chromosome (LOY) in their blood cells suggesting that LOY was by far the most common postzygotic mutation (4).

We tested this hypothesis, on 995 infants and their mothers from The North Cumbria Community Genetics Project (NCCGP) and 168 cases with childhood ALL from the Newcastle Haematology Biobank in a comprehensive study of the hereditary hemochromatosis gene HFE and other selected iron-related genes including the transferrin receptor gene TFRC (Dorak et al, MS submitted). We found that certain materno-fetal genotype combinations involving HFE and TFRC that increase fetal iron exposure resulted in higher birth weight in boys only and elevated ALL risk mainly in girls. Maternal effect was evident in mother-child pairs when mothers were positive for HFE variants, presumably increasing the amount of iron available for materno-fetal transfer. Our interpretation was that iron-related gene polymorphisms affected placental iron transport and males were able to use excessive iron by increasing fetal growth but girls were not. Greater cell proliferation rate in male fetuses would cause this dichotomy. Ultimately, boys would suffer less from the genotoxic effects of (free) iron but girls would have high amounts of iron increasing their risk for leukemia. Limited data on cord blood iron levels suggested that that when (1) the mother was positive for any of the three HFE variants that increased birth weight, (2) the offspring was male and (3) the male infant was positive for HFE and TFRC variants, birth weight would reach extreme values and cord blood iron would still be high. Thus, only the materno-fetal genotype combinations that increase iron levels most extremely would increase both birth weight and ALL risk in boys. This study suffered from lack of statistical power, especially for the assessment of interactions, and lack of plasma samples in sufficient quantity from mother-child pairs.

Estimates suggest that up to two thirds of patients do not recover following their first antidepressant treatment and up to one third do not recover after multiple treatments. Therefore, it is critically important to identify factors that predict recovery and reduce risk of relapse. Current methods in genetic epidemiology focus on predictors of mental illness onset. While this is crucial to prevent new diagnoses, it does little to help individuals already suffering. Therefore, the Recover project aims to extend current genetic epidemiology methods to better understand recovery from depression. The methods developed here will begin with a focus on depression but can also be extended to other mental illnesses. First, we will develop trajectories of depression using continuous longitudinal measures in two critical time points, 1) adolescence and early adulthood and 2) during and post pregnancy. Second, using these trajectories as outcomes we will explore many modifiable predictors of recovery. Third, we will use cutting-edge causal inference techniques to test whether or not these predictors are causal. And finally, we will develop novel technologies to capture fine-grained fluctuations in mood. Taken together, this work will lead to better interventions and inform adjuncts to treatment having real impact for the growing number of individuals suffering from depression.","With over 300 million people living with depression globally, it has been called a “mental illness epidemic”. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, resulting in an estimated 800,000 suicides per year globally and 44 million lost years of productive life. Despite increased treatment provision, prevalence of depression has not decreased and up to a third of patients have still not responded after multiple treatments. Depression can bring immense suffering to both the individual afflicted and their family. Not responding to treatment can be both terrifying and frustrating. Given this significant burden that depression poses to both the individual and their families, strategies to promote recovery and prevent relapse are of upmost importance to public health. Therefore, it is critically important for patients that we identify factors that predict recovery and reduce the risk of relapse. Our proposed Recover project would have real impact for individuals with depression, their families and wider society.","Thursday, 6 August, 2020","Tuesday, 11 August, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Statistical methods, Genetic epidemiology"

These changes can begin at different ages for people, and can also be influenced by the general physical health of the person, as well as their life experience of stress, social relationships and learning opportunities.  Physical health influences psychosocial development in several ways, and there is an accumulation of evidence that biomarkers of physical health, including markers of inflammation, cortisol levels, and other indicators of stress, influences when, and how, adolescents develop skills in emotional regulation and stress management.  There is a related body of evidence that puberty, inflammation and stress interact to influence emotional experience in childhood and adolescence, and may influence mood, and the risk of mod disorders, for example anxiety and depression.  Much of the research on the psychobiological predictors, correlates and consequences of mood and behaviour have been done with adults, and so there is still much to know about if and how adolescent development may be influenced by inflammation, biomarkers of stress and experiences, and further, how these interactions may be influenced by pubertal development.","Understanding the interaction of pubertal development, inflammation, and stress during adolescence may provide insight into vulnerabilities to poor psychobiological health and mood disorders, and how these may vary according to the physical health and health behaviours of the person.

A strong predictor of prostate cancer risk is raised levels of IGF-13. The observation that Th2 cytokines promote the expression of IGF-14 is in keeping with the hypothesis that atopy may increase risk of prostate cancer. However, it is also possible that IGF-1 may drive atopy. Laboratory studies have suggested that IGF-1 promotes Th2 responses and raised IgE5;6. Furthermore, IGF-1 is a primary mediator of the effects of growth hormone, and cord blood IGF-1 levels are positively associated with size at birth7.

The individual, familial and societal burden of autism is extensive. Depression, anxiety and suicidal behaviour and self-harm are often cited as some of the commonest co-morbidities in ASD, and may lead to additional impairment in quality of life and disability. However, the supporting data largely comprise small (typically under 100 individuals), selected samples and case series, often without a comparison group. The results are therefore difficult to generalise and estimates liable to selection bias and confounding. Since these morbidities are common in the general population, it is unclear whether autism, or any specific impairments related to autism, confer any additional risk to their development. Longitudinal population based studies following children into adulthood have been called for but have been absent from the literature to date. Beyond understanding the relative risk of adult mental health outcomes in individuals with autism, a bigger question is whether any risk or protective pathways could be identified. Such information would be invaluable to inform the development of public health interventions. As an illustrative example, bullying and victimisation, commonly experienced by children with ASD, may contribute to the future development of mental health problems. If this were true, targeting such ‘mediating’ pathways may help prevent adverse mental health outcomes in a proportion of cases, irrespective of our ability to modify core autistic symptoms.",null,"Wednesday, 3 February, 2016","Wednesday, 14 December, 2016","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, autism, Statistical methods, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Psychology - personality, Statistical methods"

It explains for

example why 'identical' twins differ in their behaviours and health outcomes like their blood pressure. Scientists are increasingly interested in epigenetics, the study of the epigenome, to better understand the links between behaviours (such as smoking), genes and disease. Epigenetic patterns are known to change over time, which may partly be due to the

influence of environmental factors (e.g. pollution), characteristics (such as our blood pressure) and behaviours (like smoking). In addition epigenetic patterns seem to change as we get older. Being able to understand which part of the epigenome changes over time, and how and when it changes could be important for understanding how risk factors interact with genes to cause disease and the general decline in health as we get older.

At the moment we do not have good statistical methods for doing this research because of how complex epigenetic dataare. The first issue is that there is a large number of methylation (epigenetic) sites for each person - 450,000 with one of

the common technologies used to measure these. This means that identifying a small number of these sites that are related to a given environmental factor, characteristic or health outcome is difficult. Secondly, identifying how epigenetic sites changes over time is not straightforward because the way in which these are measured which makes it difficult to know whether change over time is because of large change between a small number of sites or small changes between a large number of sites. Thirdly, epigenetic sites are clustered (group together) within regions of our genome, and thus two

sites from the same region may be more similar than two sites from different regions.

In this project, we aim to develop sophisticated statistical methods for identifying sites which show change in methylation

over time, and relating those changes to risk factors and later health outcomes. This will ensure the best possible use of

this emerging technology in investigating how the environment and lifestyle interact with genes to cause disease. We will

make sure our new methods can work in commonly used statistical packages and make them freely available to all

Deer, Antonia Cartwright",Parental Job Loss and Offspring Psychological and Physical Wellbeing,"Most research on parental job loss has focused on the negative outcomes for the adults experiencing it, but much less is known about the effects on their children (Kalil, 2013). Emerging evidence suggests that parental job loss increases the likelihood of poor academic outcomes (e.g., school dropout, grade retention, Kertezi & Kezdi, 2007; Stevens & Schaller, 2011), but the mediating processes for these effects are not well characterized. Furthermore, we know little about the consequences of parental job loss for the offspring’s mental and physical health, or about factors that may promote resilience for youth exposed to this economic stressor. Our team combines expertise from psychology (Guyer, Hastings, Hostinar, Thompson), family sociology (Conger) and economics (Bitler, Page) to address these gaps by examining several questions regarding the effects of parental job loss on youth’s psychological and physical wellbeing. Our research questions are informed by the family stress model (Conger et al., 2010), which posits that adverse economic conditions can be stressful to families and that this stress can shape interactions within the family through parenting practices, parent-child interactions, and interactions between parents, which can lead to poorer health, achievement, and psychological adjustment for children. ALSPAC affords a unique opportunity to test this model through its longitudinal design, allowing us to simultaneously examine (a) associations between childhood exposure to parental job loss and psychological, physical and academic/cognitive outcomes across development, as well as (b) mediating pathways (e.g., altered parent-child interactions; children’s and parents’ stress physiology), and (c) moderators or protective factors (e.g., personality, peer relationships).",null,"Friday, 17 February, 2017","Wednesday, 8 March, 2017","Social Science, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Biological samples -e.g. blood, cell lines, saliva, etc., Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Psychology - personality, Puberty, Blood pressure, BMI, Cardiovascular, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Hormones - cortisol, IGF, thyroid, Immunity, Parenting, Socioeconomic status"

The importance of, for example, post-natal depression in women is now well recognised, both in terms of its effect on maternal health and on children's development. There is growing evidence that the perinatal period is also a point of increased risk for men, and constitutes a public health concern. For example, research to date suggests that men are also affected by the birth of their child, and previous work by this team has shown that depression in men is associated with an increased risk of behavioural and emotional problems in their children. A novel feature of this research is that it examines an under-appreciated health concern in men, depression and anxiety, in a transition period of increased strain. There is ample evidence, for instance, that the transition to parenthood is associated with a marked decrease in marital quality, but little of that work incorporates the findings from perinatal psychiatry. An improved understanding of mood and anxiety changes in men in the perinatal period is important in its own right and will increase our understanding of the dynamics of mental disorder between partners in a period of increased normative stress.

Approximately 1% of the population are affected by bipolar (Pini et al., 2005), with most people experiencing the onset of mood symptoms prior to their 20s (Geoffroy et al., 2013). Despite this, little is known about the predictors to bipolar disorder and hypomania symptoms, particularly among young people. Intervening early in the development of bipolar is a top clinical priority, and one that may have the potential to limit its functional and symptomatic impact on those affected. Thus, predicting the onset of bipolar/hypomania prior to its onset, may help clinicians/researchers to develop novel, tailored preventative strategies and interventions for young people.","These results will have direct clinical implications for young people who wish to know their risk of developing hypomania, a strong signal of bipolar disorder. Currently, due to the overlap in symptoms, people presenting with bipolar symptoms are often being managed within early intervention services developed for the treatment of psychosis. This could be preventing young people presenting with bipolar symptoms from receiving adequate diagnosis and appropriate treatments early on in their care. Indeed, research suggests that, compared to out-patient treatment, early intervention may be a more clinically and cost-effective tool in managing bipolar. Thus, developing a prediction model for the onset of bipolar, novel preventative/ early intervention programmes— that are tailored to young people specifically—can be developed. This research remains a key clinical priority and will ultimately help towards reducing the psychological suffering of those with bipolar disorder. A prediction model could also enable clinicians to avoid potentially harmful treatments for people at heightened risk of bipolar, such as antidepressants which are known to trigger hypomania in people who are vulnerable to the condition.","Monday, 27 April, 2020","Friday, 1 May, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Statistical methods, Statistical methods"

To date asthma research has been predominantly focused on the most frequent mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, showing that these two disorders and broadly-defined maternal stress increase the risk of childhood respiratory diseases, most likely through the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The low prevalence of eating disorders, especially during pregnancy, makes challenging single study analyses, and collaborative projects that involve birth cohorts with prospectively collected data represent the best setting for elucidating the association between maternal eating disorders and childhood respiratory outcomes.

Beyond early delivery (e.g. to prevent pregnancy loss or severe morbidity in mother or child), and stepwise treatment (from lifestyle through oral hypoglycaemic medication to insulin) for GD, there are few effective treatments to prevent these outcomes. Recent evidence showing that glycaemia-related differences in foetal over-growth predate the time in gestation of diagnostic tests highlights the need for better early prediction tools.

By identifying women at a high risk of pregnancy-related disease, we can maximise healthcare facilities, resources and screening strategies to allow for earlier diagnosis of these disorders.

It may suggest whether proactive measures should be taken to minimise this risk.,"Wednesday, 21 March, 2018","Tuesday, 20 March, 2018","Developmental biology, Kidney disease., Statistical methods, Birth outcomes"

Phenome scans are a particular type of 'hypothesis-free' study, that test the association of a trait of interest with a comprehensive array of phenotypes â the âphenomeâ. They can be used with an approach called Mendelian randomization to search for the causal effects of a trait of interest with potentially many outcomes. Performing a phenome scan is typically non-trivial as the set of phenotypes available in a cohort tends to be highly heterogeneous. Recently, we developed a tool called PHESANT, that allows researchers to conduct phenome scans in UK Biobank. However, currently it is not easy to perform phenome scans in ALSPAC. In this project we will develop innovative software that enables researchers to easily perform their own comprehensive phenome scans in ALSPAC, searching across 'all' phenotypes is this cohort. We will demonstrate this software by searching for the causal effects of education, as an exemplar.","BENEFITS TO RESEARCHERS

1) Enabling researchers to easily conduct phenome scans in ALSPAC. For example, a researcher can use our software to systematically assess the causal effects of their exposure of interest on all phenotypes in ALSPAC, using MR-pheWAS.

2) Enabling researchers to perform other large scale data analytics using ALSPAC, e.g. machine learning. Our software can be used to automatically clean the ALSPAC data before learning machine learning models with these data.


BENEFITS TO ALSPAC

Setting up this system in ALSPAC will be of great benefit to the ALSPAC cohort, as it will enable researchers to perform phenome scans (and other large scale data analytics) hence help to maximise the impact of this world-leading cohort. We are aware that ALSPAC will move their data managment to new systems (e.g. using mongoDB) and we are keen to ensure that the software we develop is appropriate for this, to be of maximal value to ALSPAC and ALSPAC researchers.","Tuesday, 5 March, 2019","Tuesday, 5 March, 2019","Statistics/methodology, Hypothesis-free - we will search for effect across all phenotypes in ALSPAC., Statistical methods, Mendelian randomisation, Statistical methods"

Unfortunately, both asthma and obesity have been increasing in prevalence(Chinn and Rona 2001).

The lung branch of the National Health Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has suggested studies explore in utero exposure to obesity as a possible causative factor in childhood asthma(Weiss and Shore 2004). Biologic plausibility exists for this association; obesity and asthma are both conditions with an increase in certain inflammatory markers. It has been hypothesized that obesity during pregnancy may cause immunologic changes (increase in TNF alpha, IL 4 and IL5) that can be transferred to the fetus resulting in increasing risk of atopy among offspring(L.-G.

To understand early adulthood SEP we will investigate the pathways that young adults take through different levels of education, different types of employment, and time not in education, employment or training during early adulthood (age 18-25), which will together contribute to their overall SEP over this period.  We will look at the relationships between groups of the population experiencing different early adulthood SEP and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as being overweight, having high blood pressure or different levels of blood lipids.","This research will help us to understand the importance of early adulthood in the development of cardiovascular disease.

For example if the research identifies those who leave work early and move into low-grade work as particularly at risk for decreases in cardiovascular health during early adulthood, this would suggest a particular need for interventions to address this population group.

First, there is a high risk of recurrence in adulthood. Evidence from both clinical1 and community2 studies finds that adolescents with depression are more likely to have depression as adults. For example in Lewinsohn's Oregon study2 45% of 16 year olds with depression had a recurrence before the age of 23 (odds ratio 3.2 compared to no disorder). Second, once a person has had an episode of depression, it seems that future episodes are easier to provoke.3 In other words, successfully preventing the first episode of depression in adolescence might have much greater public health benefit than preventing recurrent episodes in adulthood. Third, adolescence is a critical period of life and can interfere with educational attainment and have detrimental effects on future occupation and the stability of future relationships4.

Two large international consortia have been formed to perform studies on the genetics of measures of the human body (the GIANT consortium) and measures of blood fats (GLGC). These consortia successfully identified a large number of genetic variants which influence these traits and published findings between 2013 and 2015.

Since then, newer methods have been developed which have improved our ability to look at rare genetic variants.

GIANT and GLGC have requested new analysis. This will improve the original analysis by

a) including analysis of rarer genetic variants; b) increasing the sample size to approximately one million participants and c) allow better understanding of the genetics of body composition and blood fats in different ethnic groups.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that exposure of a child before and after birth to tobacco smoke and air pollution increases their risk of developing asthma. A low consumption of fruit and vegetables and antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C, E and A) early in life may also increase risk. In the ALSPAC study we recently discovered that children with particular types of a gene called TRPA1 were more likely than children with other types of the gene to develop asthma. The TRPA1 gene controls a protein which is thought to increase inflammation of the airways in asthma, and the action of this protein is increased by harmful substances in the environment, such as tobacco smoke and air pollution.

We believe that children with ‘risky’ forms of the TRPA1 gene may be more likely than other children to develop asthma when they are exposed early in life to tobacco smoke and air pollution, or if their intake of protective antioxidants (from fruit, vegetables and vitamins) is low. We plan to test this hypothesis by analysing existing data in ALSPAC. In a subset of ALSPAC mothers and children we will also explore whether the risk of developing asthma partly depends on whether the TRPA1 gene is turned on or off. We will do this by measuring how much the DNA in the TRPA1 gene is chemically altered by a process called 'methylation'. Exposure to pollutants can alter the level of DNA methylation and this, in turn, can influence the extent to which a gene is turned on or off.

If we can confirm that infants who carry ‘risky’ forms of the TRPA1 gene are more likely to develop later asthma when exposed to harmful pollutants or a poor diet, this could help us to find ways to prevent childhood asthma from developing in the first place in these vulnerable individuals. For example, infants who are genetically susceptible in this way might particularly benefit from taking antioxidant vitamin supplements or from strategies designed to reduce their exposure to air pollution.",null,"Thursday, 1 December, 2016","Monday, 5 December, 2016","Epidemiology, Allergy, Eczema, Respiratory - asthma, Epigenetics, GWAS, Statistical methods, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution, Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc."

Shorter TL (signifying older biological age) associates with higher risk of age-related disease such as coronary artery disease. Whilst TL is strongly heritable, it is also associated with lifestyle and environmental factors, such as diet, exercise and smoking in adults. However, recent studies have proposed that TL is ""set"" in early life and that environmental/lifestyle exposures may have more effect on TL during childhood.  For example, adult smokers have, on average, shorter TL than non-smokers but smoking does not increase TL loss over time in adulthood. Therefore, the relationship between smoking and TL is more complex and is likely established at an early age. One possible explanation is that childhood exposure to smoke from parental smoking both shortens TL in the child and increases the likelihood of them smoking in later life. These same relationships may also be seen for other traits such as diet and exercise, traits that in adults are often influenced by childhood experience. Currently there are few studies that are able to address such questions. By measuring TL in children and young adults at large scale (minimum 2,900 per age group, 7, 17 and 24 years) we can more accurately explore the relationships between lifestyle and environment in childhood with TL. This will provide important information about how TL is influenced in early life and how early life exposures influence disease risk in adulthood through a biological ageing mechanism.","It is anticipated that this study will provide valuable insight into the environmental determinants of human LTL in early life and factors that influence telomere attrition in childhood. Together they will provide insight into how LTL mediated cardiovascular disease risk in adulthood is established in early life. Furthermore, the LTL measures generated will add to the phenotypes available within the ALSPAC cohort and will allow researchers to conduct future studies as the cohort ages to assess how childhood LTL relates to later life disease.","Wednesday, 7 August, 2019","Monday, 12 August, 2019","Epidemiology, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Cancer, Cognitive impairment, Diabetes, Hypertension, Mental health, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Respiratory - asthma, Telomere length measurement, Ageing, Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Cardiovascular, Genome wide association study, Mothers - maternal age, menopause, obstetrics, Physical - activity, fitness, function, Telomere"

In previous generations, when these transitions happen early or happen close together, they have been shown to be related to poorer health and related behaviours, for example, weight gain or increased smoking. However, there is little evidence available on what typical transition patterns look like for today’s young people, which patterns are the most harmful to health, or the reasons that these patterns cause poorer health (for example, is weight gain in those who have made lots of these transitions early in life explained more by the extra stress or by lack of time to eat healthily or exercise). Using data from two recent UK birth cohorts, and sophisticated methods of analysis, we will try to answer these questions. Where possible, we will see if findings differ for sex, ethnic minority, and LGBTQ+ groups. This information can help us understand the best way to support young people moving from adolescence to young adulthood, to help optimise their health later in life.","The findings will better inform policymakers and the transitions research community as to whether AST patterns have changed in recent generations, given changing cultures in educational policy and other initiatives and trends over time e.g. preventing teenage pregnancy, closing the gender gap in employment, cohabitation over marriage.

Changes in diet provide one possible explanation for this increase, but the results of dietary intervention trials in older children have been disappointing, and it has been suggested that diet during pregnancy and infancy may be critical to the development of atopy(1). In particular it has been suggested that the age of introduction of solids, duration of breastfeeding, and the balance of n-3/n-6 PUFAs in the pregnancy and infant diet may be important. Traditionally, the advice given on feeding infants at high risk of atopy is that to minimize risk they should be breastfed for at least six months, and that solid foods should be avoided for at least 4-6 months, with possible further delays in the introduction of particularly allergenic foods such as egg and peanuts(2-4). However, the efficacy of all aspects of this advice is questionable. There are a number of mechanisms by which early diet could be associated with the development of atopy. There could be a causal relationship, whereby early introduction of solid foods either induces an allergic response, or alternatively induces immune tolerance and so reduces the risk of allergy/atopy. It is possible that atopic parents, or parents noticing early symptoms of allergy in their child might delay the introduction of solids, generating a spurious association between the early introduction of solids and allergy/atopy (reverse causation). It is also possible that prolonged breastfeeding or delayed introduction of solids might increase the rates of allergy/atopy by affecting the development of mature immune response mechanisms in the infant - either by a direct reduction in exposure to immune stimulants such as bacteria, or in the case of breastfeeding by passive transfer or immune responses from the mother (hygiene hypothesis). There are relatively few studies of the associations of early diet with eczema and asthma and the results are very variable. Some studies have found early introduction of solids to be associated with wheezing and eczema, others have found no association, and some have found later introduction of particular solids to increase the risk of eczema and food sensitization (5,6).",null,"Friday, 1 August, 2008","Friday, 1 August, 2008","Allergies, Asthma, Diet, Eczema"

People born to pregnancies complicated by hypertension (i.e. gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension and stroke, in later life. The underlying disease process is identifiable in the first decades of life with evidence of emerging damage to their hearts and blood vessels. Phenotypic changes that have been observed in early postnatal life and as they reach young adulthood include higher blood pressure, altered heart structure and function, as well as a reduced number, size, and function of small blood vessels. However, to date, longitudinal data in the same individuals, as well as a multi-systems, deep phenotyping approach to characterizing cardiovascular physiology in offspring of hypertensive pregnancies, remains limited. By using ALSPAC, we will be able to make use of the previously collected demographic, anthropometric, and phenotypic data collected. We will also design a new study in 200 young adults, of which 100 will be born to hypertensive pregnancies and 100 born to normotensive pregnancies.

Animal studies suggest that the neuroendocrine system, in particular the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, is the primary biological pathway through which this occurs. This has prompted interest in the factors that may affect the foetal HPA axis in humans. Several plausible candidates exist including: prenatal maternal factors that may affect the intra-uterine environment (e.g., depression, smoking etc.) and genes affecting foetal development by regulating the maternal axis (e.g., glucocorticoid receptor and 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) isoforms1 and 2 genes). However, the human evidence regarding foetal programming of the HPA axis remains equivocal.

People with neurodevelopmental disorders have reduced life expectancy than people without such conditions (neurotypicals). Cardiovascular disease (such as heart attacks and strokes) is a significant contributor to this reduced life-expectancy. It is unclear why people with neurodevelopmental disorders are at increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Possible explanations include higher levels of cardiovascular risk factors (such as smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity) in people with neurodevelopmental disorders; difficulties in people with neurodevelopmental disorders accessing healthcare; and potentially shared biological mechanisms which contribute to causing both neurodevelopmental disorders and cardiovascular disease (such as over or under active immune systems).","We hypothesis that young adults with neurodevelopmental conditions will have higher burdens of cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular disease than neurotypical young adults, we further hypothesis that there will be a dose response relationship between number of neurodevelopmental disorder and burden of cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular disease. If this is the case it will support that people with neurodevelopmental disorders are inherently at increased risk of cardiosvuarl disease independent of their access to healthcare which would support policies of early screening and preventative interventions in this group. Furthermore it would support further research to explore mechanisms of this association. If our hypothesis is not supported it would suggest that the differences in outcome are occurring later in the lifespan and would support further research in different samples (or in ALSPAC in the future) to elucidate these mechanisms.","Friday, 27 March, 2020","Tuesday, 31 March, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Developmental disorders - autism, Hypertension, Mental health, Obesity, Statistical methods, Blood pressure, BMI, Cardiovascular, Statistical methods"

Several meta-analyses have shown robustly that childhood adversity is a cross-diagnostic risk factor, increasing rates of depression and anxiety to schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. Despite this association, the biological processes underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. Without this knowledge, development of effective therapeutics is impossible. The precise effects of childhood adversity on function per se (e.g. cognition, emotion, social function) are not well known. The aim of this research is investigate the links between adverse childhood experiences and later function, identifying domains which are most affected (both in psychiatric and clinically well populations). These domains will then be explored further using translational animal models and more focused human studies, uncovering underlying biological mechanisms and leading to novel treatment options for people affected by childhood adversity.","This research will give us deeper insights into the type of functional domains that are affected by adverse childhood experiences, irrespective of psychiatric diagnosis. It will also illuminate the moderating effect of genetic polymorphisms, providing potential mechanisms of risk vs. resilience to mental illness following adverse childhood experiences. This is extremely important in terms of identifying new therapeutic avenues, and will guide the development of translational animal models, aimed at uncovering the biological mechanisms linking childhood adversity with impairments in function (animal work is a second component of my broader fellowship application).

The US Food and Drug Administration approves growth hormone (GH) treatment on children shorter than 2.25 SD of the mean for age and sex with a predicted adult height below the normal range. Given that stature in a population follows a Gaussian distribution, 2.3% of children will always be shorter than 2 SD below the mean for age and sex.

Such a stratification is likely to substantially reduce the socioeconomic burden on many families whose children have ISS while optimizing allocation of medical resources.

This is especially problematic because obesity has been linked to many health conditions, such as diabetes, cancer and depression. There is now substantive evidence that obesity runs in families, but genetics alone cannot explain the current rise of obesity in the population. So environmental factors have been proposed to be causal for this development. It is this dual determination, that remains paradoxical:

How is it possible that obesity is explained by both genes and environments and what does this complexity mean for public health interventions?

For childhood obesity, we already know that genetic and environmental factors are

important. However, it is not known how environmental factors might be protective of genetic

liability.

The main questions are:

1. Do parental feeding practices, such as offering food to soothe, enhance or buffer the

Both tobacco and cannabis are consistently associated with the development of common mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. Prevalence of mental illness in the UK is rapidly increasing, and has increased particularly among adolescents and young adults. Tobacco and cannabis use appear to be plausible targets for intervention to improve mental health. However, there are a number of challenges that have hindered understanding of this relationship, and which have implications for how interventions should be targeted. Firstly, substance use and common mental disorders both tend to have onset in adolescence, so it is difficult to establish temporality in this relationship. Secondly, substance use and mental health share common risk factors through genes and early-life events, so it is difficult to establish whether the relationship is causal or due to shared confounding. Thirdly, the effect of substance use on mental health may not be a direct effect. It is plausible that this relationship is mediated by the social and economic adult role transitions following adolescence, or that substance use itself may be a mediating factor between early life exposures and mental health. Finally, the effects of the aforementioned changes in tobacco and cannabis products on substance use patterns and mental health are currently unknown.","The impacts will be twofold: firstly, they will contribute to ongoing policy-relevant discussions regarding the relationship between substance use and mental health, and will have utility for informing targets for intervention. Secondly, this research will form a resource for future longitudinal studies into the long-term effects of new methods of administering tobacco and cannabinoids. By collecting these data now we will be uniquely placed to study the long-term effects of use of these new products, which will be important for informing future public health.","Monday, 6 April, 2020","Monday, 6 April, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Statistical methods, Genetic epidemiology, Mendelian randomisation, Offspring, Statistical methods"

Greater breast density, i.e. the amount of fibro-glandular tissue seen on a mammogram or MRI of the breast, is a strong and highly common risk factor for breast cancer in the general population. The magnitude and consistency of the relationship between breast density and breast cancer risk make this the most significant target for breast cancer prevention. Epidemiologic data consistently report that higher birth weight (suggesting more rapid prenatal growth) and rapid height growth at puberty strongly predict later life breast cancer risk. Pubertal development also predicts breast cancer risk, with earlier age at menarche a strong risk factor for breast cancer. Sex steroids and growth factors regulate height growth and pubertal development as well as breast fibro-glandular tissue proliferation, suggesting that common mechanisms underlie growth, puberty, breast density and cancer risk. We will utilize data from two of the most comprehensively characterised pregnancy cohorts internationally.

Whilst there is growing knowledge about JIA disease management, we have very limited knowledge about the wider impacts of the condition, particularly in adolescence and adult life. For example observational data suggests that JIA patients have adverse educational attainment levels and employment outcomes. There is also growing concern about wider health implications of JIA such as cardiovascular disease risk, similar to that seen for adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, although long term follow-up data of JIA patients into adulthood is very limited. Within this PhD a range of different techniques are being used to explore causes and effects of JIA across the life course using observational and ‘omic data. Our earlier work has shown associations between JIA and a number of other health outcomes, however outcome datasets have all derived from older adult populations. Building on earlier work, this project aims to examine the association between the level of the genetic risk of JIA (using polygenic risk scoring) and a range of clinical (e.g. cardiovascular risk factors), biological (e.g. circulating CRP levels), metabolic (eg circulating lipids) and molecular (e.g. changes to DNA methylation) outcomes during childhood and early adulthood. This will allow us  to identify potential  JIA associated comorbidity earlier in disease to a) allow earlier risk stratification of patients and b) allow underlying mechanisms of comorbidity to be explored.",Understanding the wide health impact of JIA on patients with the condition will enable a more targeted and holistic approach to their care with regards to risk stratification and modification.

Despite the possibility of low intakes of some nutrients such as protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, zinc, and choline, evidence suggests that vegetarians have generally better long-term health than their omnivorous counterparts. Pregnancy is a special period in the lifecourse, when foetal development requires increased nutrient intakes and accelerates nutritional depletion, and adequate and balanced nutrition is critical for both maternal and foetal health. Two reviews have suggested that appropriately planned and well-balanced vegetarian/vegan diets during pregnancy may be considered safe for the women and their fetuses. However, little is known about whether these diets will have longer-term effects on offspring health throughout childhood. Vegetarianism is highly socially and culturally patterned, so there is a need to carefully control for confounding to infer causal effects. This PhD aims to study associations between maternal vegetarian diet and offspring health across several domains and to attempt to infer which associations are likely to be causal. It also aims to study the role of DNA methylation and circulating metabolites as mediators of any effects.",We hope to develop a better understanding of the offspring health effects of mothers following a plant-based diet during pregnancy.

However, little longitudinal evidence is available in adolescents regarding the association between PA and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Especially problematic is our lack of knowledge about the intensity of PA that is needed to prevent or treat clinically relevant symptoms in this critical period of life. This lack of knowledge can be strongly attributed to the way we currently analyze the intensity information from accelerometry. Data are âsimplifiedâ and collapsed into only a few intensities (e.g. light, moderate-to-vigorous), which are then included in statistical models. This causes substantial loss of information and challenges the detection of the relative importance of specific intensities. However, using a larger number of intensities is not possible since traditional models (i.e. multiple linear regression) cannot handle their closed structure and multicollinearity. A novel approach is multivariate pattern analysis (MPA) (specifically: partial least squares regression [PLSR]) which was introduced to PA research by Aadland et al. in 2018. MPA overcomes these shortcomings and can be used to describe the PA spectrum with many intensities (e.g. > 20 variables) while determining most important ones. This study uses MPA to investigate the association between the entire PA intensity spectrum at age 14 years and future anxiety and depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and young adulthood.","Accelerometers capture detailed but complex PA information. In practice, researchers only use a fraction of the available information (e.g. time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]) to establish associations with health outcomes. MPA allows us to use the entire intensity spectrum of PA which results in a more accurate description of PA behaviors. MPA will help us to use the intensity information from accelerometry more appropriately and to derive more reliable conclusions about how different PA intensities relate to mental health. Regarding anxiety and depressive symptoms, there is a lack of evidence for the most relevant intensities.

Unfortunately, recent estimates suggest that only 25.4% of adolescents in the US meet sleep guidelines, 26.1% meet physical activity guidelines, and only 5% meet guidelines for sleep, physical activity and sedentary behavior. Although some evidence indicates that there is a positive association between physical activity levels and sleep duration, findings among children and adolescents are not consistent and are limited by a predominantly cross-sectional study design. Although low income and minority youth are at a higher risk of not meeting both sleep and physical activity recommendations, it is unclear whether the sleep and physical activity relationship varies by racial, ethnic or socioeconomic group. Furthermore, exercise intensity appears to have a strong, positive relationship with sleep, although more research is needed to determine whether exercise at a light or moderate intensities can lead to improvements in sleep outcomes. This study aims to examine the association between physical activity and sedentary behavior, measured objectively at 11, 13 and 15 years of age, with subjectively-measured sleep at age 15. Furthermore, this study aims to understand whether the sleep and physical activity relationship varies by demographic characteristics and measures of adiposity.","This project is significant because it will utilize a longitudinal study design to assess the relationship between sleep and physical activity, which will aid in understanding whether physical activity interventions can be utilized to improve sleep outcomes in adolescents. Furthermore, this study will expand our knowledge on the association between sleep and sedentary behavior. Although some research supports an inverse association between sleep and sedentary behavior, the lack of longitudinal studies on this association makes it difficult to discern whether sedentary behavior has a negative effect on sleep outcomes, or if children who are poorer sleepers are less active as a result of increased tiredness during the day. This study will go beyond current research addressing the sleep and physical activity/sedentary behavior relationship by assessing sleep quality, and not just sleep duration, and will consider whether these associations vary by different demographic characteristics.","Tuesday, 12 January, 2021","Wednesday, 20 January, 2021","Exercise Science , Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Statistical methods, Physical - activity, fitness, function"

Studies in the United Kingdom have demonstrated the prevalence of H. pylori infection status ranging from 26-66% of the population. There is increasing evidence of the role H. pylori in the development of other diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Given the relatively high prevalence of infection, this is potentially an important disease risk factor that merits causal investigation. Studies have suggested that infection with H. pylori may affect lipid metabolism, especially with the cardiovascular risk factors: HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride and apolipoproteins. By this mechanism, this could increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Additionally, studies have postulated that H. pylori could be involved in the development of atherosclerosis by causing vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. H. pylori has also been shown to be involved in gastric carcinogenesis. Through the disruption of epithelial cell functions by H. pylori cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA), this oncogenic factor activates oncogenic pathways in these cells and induces epigenetic modifications which play a significant role in initiating carcinogenesis.","This research will contribute to the understanding of the causal role of H.pylori in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and cancers, which can then inform public health policies by identifying specific biomarkers and advise novel interventions that can alleviate the risk of developing such diseases.","Tuesday, 13 March, 2018",null,"Genetic epidemiology (including association studies and mendelian randomisation), Cancer, Diabetes, Infection, Cardiovascular disease, GWAS, Statistical methods, Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Cardiovascular, Genetic epidemiology, Genome wide association study, Mendelian randomisation"

It has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Previous studies have shown higher rates of sleep disruption, inattention, and forgetfulness in children with AD compared to those without AD; these suggest that neurocognition, which encompasses functions such as language, memory, attention, and executive functions, may be impacted by AD. However, there are few studies of cognition in children with AD. Previous studies have also been limited by small sample size and have shown mixed findings. Thus, the purpose of this study is to compare neurocognitive function between children with and without AD using the large ALSPAC cohort. We will comprehensively assess multiple domains of cognition (e.g. attention, executive function, memory, IQ) using validated and standardized measurements. We will examine the overall impact of AD on these cognitive outcomes, accounting for demographic and socioeconomic factors and other comorbidities. In addition, we will examine whether cognitive function differs with respect to AD disease activity.",The proposed study addresses critical gaps in our knowledge about the cognitive impact of AD in the pediatric population. We expect that the findings will inform future prospective studies and mechanistic research on neuropsychiatric comorbidities of AD and also direct the development and implementation of interventions aimed at preventing and/or minimizing the cognitive impact of AD.

The aetiology ot ASD comprises known genetic factors [1,2] and increasing evidence suggests a role for intrauterine environmental factors, such as exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy [3]. Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been associated with other adverse perinatal outcome such as lower birth weight and higher risk of other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [5], therefore smoking during pregnancy is a biologically plausible hypothesis in the aetiology of autism but the evidence is still inconsistent. Epigenetics is one potential mechanism linking intrauterine exposures and postnatal outcomes. DNA methylation changes induced by the prenatal exposure could affect genes that are implicated in the aetiology of ASD and therefore DNA methylation could be a causal mediator for the increase risk of ASD. A recent study in the ALSPAC has shown that maternal smoking is associated to DNA methylation changes across the genome, including the replication of genes that were found in other cohorts and new targets [6]. Although an association between maternal smoking in pregnancy and autism might be plausible, there is much inconsistencies in studies to date. In particular, when investigating causal effects in observational studies there is the possibility of unobserved and residual confounding and a way to overcome this issue is by using genetic variants as proxies for the exposure as in a Mendelian Randomization framework [7]. GWAS studies have observed robust associations between smoking and a locus on chromosome 15 involving the CHRNA3 gene, as well as associations in other genes such as BDNF [8].",null,"Tuesday, 10 March, 2015","Thursday, 12 March, 2015","Epigenetics , Smoking"

A Mendelian randomization approach can further address the issue of confounding by using genetic variants, reliably associated with adiposity or glucose metabolism, as instrumental variables for its their causal intrauterine effect. For this purpose, we propose to use single nucleotide polymorphisms that have shown strong associations in previous GWAS with adiposity, or fasting glucose. To have the greatest statistical power we will combine the SNPs into at-risk allele scores.

Combined with other circumstantial evidence, we propose that important functional relationships exist between the hormones that regulate phosphate levels and sclerostin, which contribute to the decline in bone density seen in renal impairment. This hypothesis will be examined by exploring relationships between klotho levels, measured as part of this proposal, and sclerostin, in a sample of ALSPAC mothers.","Characterising the relationship between klotho and sclerostin will help in understanding the pathogenesis of osteoporosis associated with CKD, leading to new opportunities for treatment. If sclerostin is found to be related to klotho levels, this may raise safety concerns over sclerostin antibody treatment being developed for osteoporosis, given the link between phosphate metabolism and vascular calcification.","Wednesday, 7 March, 2018","Thursday, 8 March, 2018","Physiology, Bone disorders - arthritis, osteoporosis, ELISA, Biological samples -e.g. blood, cell lines, saliva, etc."

Indoor tanning, defined as the use of an ultraviolet emission device to produce a cosmetic tan[1], has been associated with increased risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and thus has been classified as a group I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer[2]. Despite the risk posed by this activity, indoor tanning is common practice among young people in developed countries. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies of indoor tanning and NMSC showed that ever exposure to indoor tanning was associated with a higher risk of both, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, and that exposure at a young age (< 25 years of age) increased these risks considerably[1]. Similarly, melanoma risk was significantly higher due to sunbed use, as reported by a systematic review and meta-analysis of 27 observational studies[3]. Since indoor tanning is a potentially modifiable exposure it is of interest to examine its frequency and the characteristics of its users in the ALSPAC cohort. Up until 2017 ALSPAC did not include questions regarding indoor tanning. The exceptions are the motherâs âYour environmentâ questionnaire administered in early gestation asking how often they had used a sun bed or lamp during their pregnancy, and the child-based KN questionnaire at 69 months old asking about ever use of sun bed or lamp and its frequency. On the other hand, ALSPAC children have been assessed with respect to natural sunlight exposure at regular intervals, although only up to the age of 12 years.

In one of the last waves of data collection for ALSPAC Young People (YP, Life@25+) we requested that a number of questions regarding indoor and outdoor tanning be included. This information is now available and we would like to investigate the determinants and the effects of tanning behaviour in the participants of ALSPAC at different life stages.","Uncovering determinants of indoor tanning and natural sunlight exposure habits among young people in the south of England will help us better understand the importance of these predictors as risk factors for melanoma and NMSC in this population, and might provide support for the implementation of specific preventative measures. Additionally, the influence of sun exposure on health, if identified, will lead us to consider sunlight-related interventions in order to improve the population’s wellbeing.","Tuesday, 4 February, 2020","Tuesday, 11 February, 2020","Genetic epidemiology (including association studies and mendelian randomisation), Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, GWAS, Statistical methods, sun exposure"

Long-term exposure to these elements is possible through the food chain, water contamination, and air pollution depending on local conditions. Arsenic appears to impair neurocognitive performance but not behavioural outcomes (Tolins et al, 2014), and the impacts on language or motor development are less clear. There have been few studies to date of cadmium and neurodevelopment (Rodriguez-Barranco et al, 2013), although previous work within ALSPAC found no association with motor skills (Taylor et al, 2018). Mercury at high-doses is known to delay neurodevelopment (Grandjean & Herz, 2011), but the evidence for an effect at more realistic low-levels is unclear. The strongest evidence of harm during childhood from heavy metals is exposure to lead which has been reliably linked to impaired cognitive, behavioural, and motor development (Sanders et al, 2009).

In particular, attention has been directed towards bullying and intimate partner violence (IPV) as these are two of the most common forms of violence perpetrated and experienced. Individuals who are involved in bullying or IPV as either perpetrators or victims are at an increased risk of experiencing mental health problems (i.e. depression, anxiety, substance use) and greater difficulties in life (i.e. academic decline, financial difficulties, poor physical health). To date the majority of research has investigated bullying and IPV independently of one another in the same individual. The small number of studies which have not, have found that bullying perpetrators are more likely to be perpetrators of IPV and victims of bullying are more likely to be victims of IPV. However these studies have predominantly been conducted in America, have focused on teen dating violence as a form of IPV and have investigated the relationship concurrently. Furthermore very few studies have investigated the continuation of exposure to violence from bullying to IPV by exploring underlying mechanisms which may explain why this is happening for some and not all. As bullying and IPV are interpersonal in nature, factors which influence social interactions and the processing of the social environment and cues may help us to understand the relationship between the two. For example these include the ability to correctly identify emotions and the causes of events and interactions. Identifying individuals who experience both forms of violence and thus experience violence across their lifespan could prove to be an important way to predict and improve the impact on their well-being.","This project will provide deeper aetiological knowledge and provide an insight into the behavioural profiles of those exposed to bullying and intimate partner violence (IPV). It will be of interest to academics as it will be the first to investigate the longitudinal association between bullying and IPV and explore possible underlying pathways. It will be of relevance to public health practitioners and policy makers as bullying and IPV are robustly associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Furthermore, through the identification of mediators, findings from this project could be used to inform interventions aimed at supporting and reducing the impact of bullying and IPV.","Tuesday, 26 February, 2019","Tuesday, 26 February, 2019","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Statistical methods, violence: intimate partner violence, bullying

However, the association between green spaces and harmful or beneficial effects on children health is still poor for most outcomes, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Outcome wide analysis have recently been proposed as a way to evaluate the effects of exposures over numerous important outcomes. Indeed, some exposures may be harmful for some outcomes and beneficial for others, including green spaces exposures. This approach also has the advantage to better control for confounding for the effects of the exposure on all outcomes simultaneously. It is different from the traditional one-outcome approach and more similar to GWAS (genome wide associations) or EWAS (epigenome wide associations) or ExWAS (exposome wide associations).

In fact, early divergences from the normal growth curve at critical windows during infancy and later childhood are frequently associated with a higher incidence of obesity and impaired metabolic health in adulthood (Dietz WH, AJCN 1994). GWA studies have revealed several genetic variants associated with adult anthropometric measures such as weight and BMI. The main objective of this study to investigate whether phenotypes such as peak weight velocities (PWV) and timing of Adiposity Rebound(AR) derived from longitudinal data are associated with early adiposity (Sovio et al, PLoS Genet 2011). Since the effects of common variants on these traits are small or moderate, we propose a GWAS meta-analysis approach in the EGG cohorts that have both GWA data and frequent enough height and weight measurements available in infancy and/or middle childhood. The specific age window that will be considered: (1) infancy 0-2 years and (2) early childhood from 1.5-7 years. The phenotypes which are calculated are: peak weight velocity (PWV) in infancy, BMI and Age at Adiposity Peak (AP) and Adiposity rebound (AR). In ALSPAC, we propose calculation of PWV and BMI AP as it has data available on infant weight at birth, 6 weeks, 9 months and 18 months.

Accuracy is critical; underestimating or overestimating the level of threat and danger can have negative consequences. For example, underestimation of risk in a pandemic can reduce adoption of protective and preventative health behaviours (Dryhurst et al., 2020; Khosravi, 2020; Leppin & Aro, 2009). While overestimation of risk can increase hoarding behaviour, potentially leading to shortages of medications and personal protective equipment (Abrams & Greenhawt, 2020). Overestimation of risk may also lead to reluctance to return to normal activities as national lockdowns ease.","It is important to identify modifiable predictors of poorer mental health and wellbeing, such as subjective risk perceptions, as this may inform intervention efforts. Keeping the risk of COVID-19 in perspective may help to prevent poorer mental health and wellbeing and subsequent harmful coping strategies. It is also important to identify predictors of COVID-19 risk perceptions, as this can affect health behaviours.

These countries also suffer from a heavier burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Obesity is associated with higher risk of CVD, possible pathways have been investigated, including chronic low grade inflammation and oxidative stress. A recent study gives evidence that adiposity may cause DNA methylation, a mechanism of altering DNA expression without changing DNA sequence. However, whether DNA methylation mediated the association of adiposity with CVD risk is not clear. This study aims to assess this potential mediated effect, and may therefore use DNA methylation to identify high risk group of CVD. And since DNA methylation has a potential to be reversed, this may also provide insight into CVD prevention among overweight and obese population.

Therefore, this study investigates whether maternal and child body mass index (BMI) is associated with cardio-metabolic risk score in adolescence, and whether this association is mediated by DNA methylation in cord blood and childhood.

Work in animal models demonstrate proof of principle,but may not be generalisable to humans. The small number of studies undertaken in humans have failed to use robust methods for demonstrating a specific intrauterine effect, as opposed to shared familial (environmental or genetic) effects, and have failed to adequately control for potential confounding factors.",null,"Thursday, 5 January, 2006","Thursday, 5 January, 2006","Endocrine, Growth, Obesity, Weight, Birth Outcomes"

The adoption of viral suppression measures, including social distancing and both localised and national lockdowns, has led to an increase in economic inactivity and changes to the labour market. According to Office of National Statistics estimates (ONS October 2020), since March 2020 the rate of economic growth in the United Kingdom has been slowing and unemployment has risen sharply with the most dramatic decline being during the early stages of the pandemic. The effect of these changes to employment status (increased/decreased hours, periods of furloughed employment, redundancy, change in employment) on physical and mental health and health behaviours (alcohol consumption, exercise, diet) during the pandemic is currently unclear. An important consideration is whether different social factors (e.g. gender, ethnicity, economic situation, clinical vulnerability to COVID-19) contribute to poorer health and wellbeing during the pandemic because of changes in employment status.

Of these, 96% were micro-businesses with less than 10 employees (Business Statistics, Standard Note, SN/EP/6152, House of Commons Library, December 2018). In fact, policymakers advocate support to entrepreneurship as a way forward for socioeconomic development at regional and national level, therefore helping these firms to form is key to UK prosperity. Government support for entrepreneurs often takes a macro perspective of intervention through subsidies and infrastructure. There is, however, increasing recognition in the entrepreneurship field that the decision to become an entrepreneur and start new ventures is strongly embedded in the close and personal space surrounding an individual, starting from their family relationships. It is well known that self-employment and business ownership choices are highly persistent across generations: entrepreneurial parents tend to have entrepreneurial children. We know much less, however, about the underlying mechanisms that transmit and shape those choices. This is what our project will address. We will examine the ways in which entrepreneurial parents affect their childrenâs entrepreneurial preferences and behaviours directly â through being role models and providing advice â and indirectly â through shaping attitudes to risk and uncertainty, and exposing the stresses and wellbeing impacts inherent in starting a business. Our findings will identify new ways in which policy can encourage and nurture entrepreneurialism.","Our project emphasises the dual relationship linking the family context and entrepreneurship. On one side, the family can facilitate the emergence of preferences for entrepreneurship in the children by providing the ‘learning space’ in which children observe how entrepreneurs live and operate through the experience of their entrepreneurial parents. On the other side, the family can be the ‘resounding space’ of the successes but also the frustrations of being an entrepreneur, which may lead to the development in the children of negative emotions in association with entrepreneurship. 

Understanding the complex role of the family in entrepreneurship is of interest for different constituencies, starting from the public and the entrepreneurial parents more specifically. Thanks to the internet, setting up a business from home has become a choice increasingly available to people, parents in particular. Indeed, the Government is committed to making the UK the best place to start and grow a business, with particular initiatives – such as the £1million Women and Broadband Challenge and the ASPIRE fund – aiming to encourage more women to set-up their own businesses.  For mothers especially, the decision to become entrepreneur is often motivated by the prospect of achieving a better work-life balance. One of the expected outcomes of this project is to highlight the implications of being an entrepreneurial parent on the wellbeing of their children. Our findings can thus enhance awareness among parents of the implications of their employment choices not only from a business perspective but also more broadly in relation to the impact on the family lifestyle. This can lead to a better understanding of the challenges of achieving a work-life balance and can inform a broader discussion about how to meet and mitigate these challenges. This discussion involves not only entrepreneurial parents as direct subjects, but also policymakers who want to pursue a more holistic approach to entrepreneurship policy, in which the entrepreneur is regarded not only as a driver of change and wealth creation, but also as an individual embedded in a social context of personal relationships. In this type of policy approach, it is key to ask how to support children in families in which there is a risk that the uncertainties of entrepreneurship resonate too loudly. Given the policy relevance of this work for a number of areas, we will engage with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) as a primary research user, and also with the Department for Work and Pensions as there are implications for the design of work-related benefits. 

Another implication of our argument is that entrepreneurship needs a supporting environment that goes beyond the provision of incentives and infrastructure, and which finds its root in the family. Illustrating how entrepreneurial parents can be positive role models that inspire younger generations, helping them to take on board the challenges of an entrepreneurial career, aids understanding of how to create a broader learning environment for entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship education mostly takes place in dedicated programmes at universities, generally at Masters level and in Business Schools. Yet the family is the most immediate and personal environment in which children can learn about ‘the way of life of the entrepreneur’. Furthermore, while university entrepreneurship education tends to focus on the business principles underlying the creation of a new venture, a more broadly defined notion of entrepreneurship education involves enabling the development of creative mind-sets and the capacity to embrace uncertainty. Families and schools are likely terrain for this type of learning. From this perspective, our project can inform the discussion about the design and impact of practices for extending entrepreneurship education to children and young people. Indeed, a number of recent initiatives have been implemented in the last five years by the Government with the purpose of promoting entrepreneurship by engaging with young people early on through the education system. Our work will inform these initiatives, with parties involved in this discussion including formal and informal education providers (schools, parents, and charities) as well as government policy-related agencies and the Department for Education.","Monday, 1 June, 2020","Monday, 1 June, 2020","Social Science, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Cognitive impairment, Hypertension, Mental health, Obesity, Statistical methods, Blood pressure, BMI, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Offspring, Psychology - personality, Social science, Statistical methods"

Previous research exploring data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children has shown that children, aged 2.5 and 9 years old, experiencing frequent nightmares were more likely to report psychotic experiences at age 12 (Fisher et al., 2014). Similarly, nightmares at 12 years old was also found to be associated with an increased risk of psychotic experiences at aged 18 (Thompson et al., 2015). Such findings suggest that nightmares during childhood may represent an important and clinically significant indicator for risk of psychotic experiences in adolescence.","This research will highlight whether childhood sleep disturbances represent an early risk factor for the development of psychotic experiences in adulthood. This will extend previous research which has shown childhood sleep disturbances to be related to psychotic experiences during adolescence (Fisher et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2015).

But in reality it is difficult to know just what a small or large size is. A common measure that has been used in lots of studies is to take account of how far on the mother was in her pregnancy at the time their child was born. This allows us to tell the difference between, for example, a baby who is small because they delivered too early but might have been growing normally in the womb and one who is small because they were undernourished and did not grow properly in the womb. Similarly it allows us to tell the difference between a baby who might be large because they stayed in the womb for longer than average and one who grew too rapidly because they were overnourished. Calibrating birth size against how long a woman has been pregnant is done using growth charts, similar to those used to plot an infants growth after they are born. Until recently these charts have reflected average growth patterns for a specified population. For example if a baby today was plotted on a UK 2000 growth chart of birth weight for gestational age and they were on what was called the 50th percentile. This would indicate that their weight was the same as the average for all other babies of the same sex and who had had the same time in the womb who were born in the UK in 2000. Recently it has been suggested that instead of those total population averages 'customised growth charts' should be used to define whether a baby is too heavy or light after accounting for how long they have been in the womb. As well as time in the womb these 'customised growth charts' take account of what are assumed to be characteristics that affect fetal growth in a 'biological' (non-pathological) way: the mother's weight and height at first clinic, her ethnicity, whether this is her first, second, etc child. These charts are somewhat controversial as on the one hand they might be correctly allowing for 'biological' differences in size but on the other they might (for example) be assuming that it is normal for a particular ethnic group to always be smaller than another ethnic group which might not be the case.",null,"Friday, 27 November, 2015","Wednesday, 2 December, 2015",Perinatal health / epidemiology (NOTE FROM DEBBIE - PERINATAL SHOULD BE ON LIST)

It is also known that the causes of psychological difficulties such as anxiety, depression, psychosis and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder include both inherited and environmental factors.  For instance, stressful life events such as being victimised by peers or losing a loved one increase the risk of experiencing psychological difficulties.  Similarly, molecular genetic studies have identified genetic variants that have a small but significant effect on the likelihood of developing common psychological disorders.  Better cognitive ability and planning appear to protect individuals from developing psychological problems.  This may be because better cognitive processing enables individuals to ‘cope’ more effectively with genetic and environmental risk by allowing them to employ compensatory strategies.  Several recent studies support the view that cognitive ability may protect individuals from developing problems when they have either genetic or environmental risk factors (Kendler et al., 2014; Johnson, 2012; Davidovich et al., in press; Pargas et al., 2008; Riglin et al., 2016).

Furthermore, problematic drinking behavior such as binge drinking (defined as consuming more than four drinks for women and five drinks for men in the past two weeks) and alcohol use disorders emerge in adolescence. Underage drinking brings long-term negative consequences such as permanent damage to brain development, later alcoholism and drug problems, and school drop-outs that affects later education and occupation. For adolescents, family environments such as family conflict and parental monitoring have been studied as risk factors for alcohol use and abuse. However, some people in those environments do not develop drinking problems while other do. Gene and environment interaction (GxE) studies could provide compelling explanations for this, demonstrating that an individual's genotypes strengthen or weaken their susceptibility to the environmental influences.

While, a small body of literature has considered the stability of BPD symptoms over time, there are few studies that have examined the long-term clinical and psychosocial impacts of the disorder. The few studies that have reported negative outcomes in youth with BPD symptoms in community populations (e.g., Cohen et al., 2007; Winograd et al., 2008) utilised ad hoc, self-created assessments of BPD rather than established, validated tools.

At present, we are failing our patients, with inadequate strategies and therapeutic interventions. Novel therapeutic agents for eczema are on the horizon; multidimensional phenotyping would allow us to understand how to better use these and existing therapies to help our patients, by allowing us to tailor treatments for individual patients (personalized medicine). Understanding phenotypes would also help inform prevention strategies, which are important giving the rising prevalence of eczema.

What research there is tends to focus on weight (dis)satisfaction or weight misperception; however, contemporary body image theory suggests there is more to body image than concerns about weight and sociological work suggests that this focus on weight may be a particularly middle class component of feelings about the body. It is important to understand how body image concerns may be different among varied socioeconomic groups, as this may help to design interventions that are accessible and relevant across these groups. Additionally, body image concerns may have different relationships with important outcomes (eg. health behaviour, wellbeing, education) depending on socioeconomic status; however, these relationships have not previously been investigated.

Using the ALSPAC data, we will investigate two key questions:

1.	How are childrenâs evaluations of their own appearance, appearance ideals, and appearance changing behaviours shaped by socioeconomic status?

2.	Does childrenâs body image at age 13 predict health, wellbeing, and educational outcomes later in adolescence, and do these relationships vary by socioeconomic status?

The ALSPACâs longitudinal nature, large representative sample, and inclusion of multiple body-image related measures (unlike many existing large cohort datasets) enables us to address these questions.","Within the body image field, this research addresses an important gap relating to socioeconomic status and body image. Its findings may shape the design of future interventions, making them more accessible and meaningful for low SES participants in particular. It may also impact on how body image is measured by academics in this field, in order to provide a meaningful account of body image concerns across SES groups.

Outside of academia, the research may help school staff and organisations that work with young people to better understand the nature of body image concerns across SES groups, enabling them to provide better pastoral support for children and adolescents with these concerns. It may also (depending on the findings) help to challenge persistent myths which suggest body image concerns (and eating disorders) are relevant only for the economically privileged.","Friday, 13 July, 2018","Tuesday, 17 July, 2018","Social Science, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Eating disorders - anorexia, bulimia, Mental health, Statistical methods, body dissatisfaction; wellbeing; socioeconomic status; appearance ideals; body image"

The energy density of food has been shown to increase energy intake and short term weight gain in experimental studies 5.

When persistent, PEs increase the likelihood of a person developing psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, other psychiatric conditions (eg depression) and poor psychosocial outcomes such as unemployment.  PEs can sometimes recede as people pass from adolescence to adulthood but we don't know how changes in the brain, which continues to develop and mature through these years, underlie and affect PEs. Thanks to grants from the MRC, we have recently shown, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, that at age 20+, individuals from ALSPAC with PEs have small changes in regional brain volumes, and global and local connectivity which cannot be ascribed to the consequences of having a psychiatric diagnosis or treatment with medication. We have also shown that individuals from ALSPAC who may be at a slightly increased risk of psychosis due to their genetic makeup (using a ârisk scoreâ made out of the contribution of the many genes which when added together, are associated with a small but significantly increased risk of schizophrenia) also have subtle changes in brain thickness and volume.

Our objective is to re-scan these same individuals, numbering about 450 in total, at age 26 using the full range of MRI scanning techniques. This will enable us to test the hypothesis that persistent PEs are underpinned by anomalous pathways or trajectories of brain development and abnormalities in function, as compared with those without PEs and against their original baseline scans. Additional objectives are to plot changes in cognition (using IQ tests) which we expect might show some decline in those with persistent PEs.  We will make use of the latest genetic risk for schizophrenia scores from genome-wide association studies available in ALSPAC to examine the potential of our brain measures to be used as intermediate links between genes and clinical outcomes. Finally we will see if blood markers of inflammation which can act on the brain, measured in the same individuals when they were children and again when adults, might explain the brain changes we see on MRI.

We will use a powerful 3 Tesla MRI brain scanner located in Cardiff to obtain detailed structural images and measures of grey and white matter volumes and a particular variant of scanning called diffusion tensor imaging which picks up the integrity of white matter tracts - nature's wires - that connect together groups of brain cells. Functional MRI, which picks up those parts of the brain that are active during a task, will be carried out while participants are trying to remember a sequence of letters and also while they are at rest (although their brains will still be working). This will help us to determine the degree of physiological compromise/compensation evident in the brain in those with PEs and structural changes. This will also help us look at how the different specialised parts of the brain are working together as a coherent unit.

This project will enable us to map the change in brain development in young people with and without potentially important psychotic experiences (PEs) taken from ALSPAC, one of the most well-studied epidemiological samples available to medical science. Because there is such a wealth of information available, it means that when we analyse the brain scans we can take into account lots of other factors which might otherwise obscure or falsely exaggerate the effects of PEs such as cannabis and alcohol misuse. The project as a whole has the potential to advance in our understanding of the biological basis of psychotic and related disorders and to help guide the development of primary prevention and early intervention strategies in mental health care.",null,"Thursday, 4 January, 2018","Tuesday, 9 January, 2018","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Allergy, Eating disorders - anorexia, bulimia, Eczema, Epilepsy, Fertility/infertility, Gastrointestinal, Hypertension, Incontinence, Infection, Learning difficulty, Mental health, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Obesity, Pain, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Respiratory - asthma, Sexually transmitted diseases, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, Speech/language problem, Bone disorders - arthritis, osteoporosis, Developmental disorders - autism, Cancer, Chronic fatigue, Cognitive impairment, Congenital abnormalities, Diabetes, NMR, Immunity"

For example, Down syndrome1, Prader-Willi syndrome2 and Foetal Alcohol Syndrome3 are all associated with characteristic facial features that are used as part of the diagnostic criteria. In recent years, the development of 3D geometric morphometrics (the statistical analysis of face shape) allowed researchers to identify more subtle facial dysmorphologies4. Hennessy et al5 found subtle differences in the 3D facial shape of schizophrenia patients compared to controls, such as a lengthened lower mid-facial height in schizophrenia patients. Hennessy et al6 also found that bipolar patients exhibited several facial dysmorphologies relative to controls and schizophrenia patients. The development of the face and the brain is closely connected7. Facial dysmorphologies therefore provide insight into the developmental origins of neurodevelopmental disorders, since the developmental biology of facial features is better understood than that of the brain5.",null,"Monday, 22 July, 2013","Thursday, 29 August, 2013",Genetics

In addition, extended periods of sitting are especially harmful to health. Our recent studies have shown large increases in sitting throughout childhood and adolescence and most teenagers will spend almost 9h/day sitting by the time they reach age 15y, that is more than the average American adult sits. This has led to an increasing interest in policy and research interventions aiming to reduce sitting in children and teenagers. However, there is limited evidence on whether sitting time matters to health in the teenage years. To inform future research and policy interventions which aim to change sitting behaviour it is crucial to establish whether or not it actually affects health during the teenage years.

We are performing a genome wide association study (GWAS) to address the hypothesis that gene-environment interactions in the context of the maternal-fetal unit impact fetal size at birth and maternal metabolism. This is being accomplished using Caucasian, Hispanic, and Afro-Caribbean DNA samples collected from mothers and offspring as part of the NIH-funded Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study. HAPO is a multicenter, international study in which high quality phenotypic data related to fetal growth and maternal glucose metabolism was collected from 25,000 pregnant women of varied racial backgrounds using standardized protocols that were uniform across centers. A major strength of HAPO is the large number of subjects available for replication. In addition to the samples analyzed in the initial GWAS, there are additional cohorts of Caucasian, Asian and Israeli Arab/Bedouin and Jewish mothers and babies which are available for replication of the initial GWAS findings. Importantly, phenotype data related to fetal growth and maternal metabolism was collected from these mothers and babies using standardized protocols that were uniform across centers and identical to those used to phenotype subjects in the initial GWAS. In this initial replication study, we intend to focus efforts on a phenotype for which: (i) there are not other ongoing, large GWAS efforts and (ii) there are large replication cohorts from the same ethnic background available. Thus, this study aims to replicate the contribution of maternal SNPs to offspring birth weight and the contribution of fetal SNPs before and after correction for maternal genotype to offspring birth weight. Importantly, our proposal takes advantage of one of the unique strengths of HAPO, access to GWAS data from both mothers and their offspring, and we will be able to consider the contribution of both offspring and maternal genetic variation to the regulation of birth weight. We intend to use a two-stage replication approach by including an additional large cohort of Caucasian subjects from the UK who were recruited under the auspices of the Exeter Family Study of Childhood Health (EFSOCH) and ALSPAC.

The mother is often considered the âgatekeeperâ to paternal involvement

This can introduce selection bias that can make maternal effects appear relatively stronger than paternal effects

For example, a previous study found that paternal participation was lower for mothers from low SEP, ethnic minorities, and those who smoke. This would contribute to any paternal effect of these factors on offspring health appearing smaller and weaker than any maternal effect.

A better understanding of the factors that influence paternal participation will enable researchers to develop strategies to increase paternal participation, thereby reducing these issues with bias. It will also highlight scenarios that might be subject to selection bias, which will help with interpretation of results.

Hypothesis-free approaches, such as those involving genetic and epigenetic âomic data, can help identify factors that influence paternal participation without reliance on/bias from the researchersâ assumptions.

 1Our overall goal is to add a limited number of additional variables to our current data analyses using the ALSPAC data. We currently have information on the level of response to alcohol and demography at age 12-13, know the outcome regarding a limited number of alcohol-related variables at age 14-15, and have models of how the level of response to alcohol relates to alcoholic outcomes in teenagers and adults from several additional studies (the Collaborative Study on Genetics of Alcoholism, the San Diego Prospective Study adults, and the San Diego Prospective Study adolescents). However, to date none of these structural equation models have been tested in subjects in their early teens. Therefore, if several additional areas of data can be made available to us within the next week or so, we will be able to test whether aspects of the structural equation models generated in late teenagers and adults apply to the ALSPAC population using predictors from age 12-13.

Methylation mainly occurs at cytosines in humans, often in the context of a cytosine followed by a guanine (CpG). Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) seek to understand the link between DNA methylation patterns at thousands or millions of CpG sites across the genome to various traits and exposures. In recent years, the increase in availability of DNA methylation measures in population-based cohorts and case-control studies has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of EWAS being performed and published. To make this rich source of molecular data more accessible, we have manually curated a database of CpG-trait associations (with p<1x10-4) from published EWAS, each assaying over 100,000 CpGs in at least 100 individuals. The database currently contains over 500,000 CpG associations for more than 150 EWAS. It is accompanied by a web-based tool and R package that allow these associations to be easily queried. In the near future, we hope this database will be extended to include genome-wide EWAS summary statistics, including over 200 million associations from over 500 EWAS of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort (N~900). This database will give researchers the opportunity to quickly and easily query EWAS associations to gain insight into the molecular underpinnings of disease as well as the impact of traits and exposures on the DNA methylome.

Typically, females make stronger immune responses to vaccines and infections and achieve superior outcomes throughout life. For example, females achieve the same levels of neutralizing antibodies from half the dose of influenza vaccine as males from the full dose. However, this more exuberant immune response leads to greater susceptibility to immunopathology and autoimmune diseases and more adverse events from immunizations. To complicate matters, there are exceptions; as fetuses, females have a 2-fold greater susceptibility to mother-to-child transmission of both HIV and HCV infection, and to IFN-I-resistant viruses. To better understand the mechanisms responsible for these complex observations, we propose to compare the epigenetic and hormonal responses in males and females to immunization and vaccination in early life. We hypothesize that life-long immune sex differences are established early through the interplay of host genetics, sex-specific steroid biosynthesis, epigenetics and the environment, and that early-life epigenetic changes in response to sex-specific steroid modulation and infection and immunization play a dominant role in this process.","In the short-term, we hope to better understand the mechanism responsible for sex-specific immune responses.

Parental substance use has deleterious effects on children's health i.e. increased risk of mental health illness, aggression, anti-social behaviour. Children whose parent(s) use substances are at a higher risk of poorer educational outcomes â however, more robust evidence is needed. Alongside this, the research has focused on the directional relationship, and so far, we are unaware of the mechanisms in this relationship. Evidence suggests that parental substance use changes the behaviour of the parent and disrupts the family environment; this can often be compromised of high parental conflict, increased risk of child abuse, ineffective parenting behaviours and low family routine â all aspects which are crucial for childrenâs educational success. Therefore, this thesis aims to understand the relationship between parental substance use and children's school outcomes and test whether the family-related variables can mediate/explain this.","The results of the analysis will be published in a good (open access) journal and will provide the first UK estimates of how parental substance use effects children's school outcomes.

Given the adverse effects of adolescent drug use on adult outcomes, these numbers are alarming. Why do so many young people experiment with drugs? How many of them are regular users? Is the use of illicit drugs systematically linked to alcohol and tobacco use? How are temporary and chronic use reflected in psychosocial adjustment and accomplishment of normative development milestones? Perhaps most pressing, can we identify protective factors that increase the likelihood for youngsters to abstain and users to desist from using drugs before they can leave lasting damage? Answering those questions is crucial to understand drug use pathways and their antecedents and outcomes, through the life course.

Focussing on incidence and course of illegal drug use throughout adolescence and young adulthood, we aim to a) identify predictors of onset of experimental and regular use of cannabis and hard drugs, b) predict the developmental trajectories of cannabis and hard drug use, and c) identify outcomes of these trajectories. Cannabis and hard drug use are no isolated phenomena, they occur in interplay with use of other substances such as tobacco and alcohol use and are often connected to mental health problems from the internalizing and externalizing spectrum. Hence, co-developmental pattern and interactive and cumulative risks are identified.

Two major multi-reporter longitudinal cohort studies provide the data for this project: The British Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/) is an ongoing study of 14.500 families where the first assessment took part during pregnancy and the target sample of young people has now reached the mid-twenties.

The liberal Dutch climate towards drug use, specifically the tolerance policy towards cannabis possession and production is in stark contrast to the British perspective where cannabis is criminalized.

Although there are potential advantages to these trends, particularly in terms of financial security, there are also disadvantages, many of which are poorly understood at present. The detrimental effect of increasing maternal age on the health and development of offspring is widely recognised but the effect of increasing paternal age remains largely unexplored. However, there is emerging evidence that pregnancies conceived to older men are more likely to end in spontaneous abortion and that their children may be less intelligent, and be at higher risk of adverse outcomes and developmental disorders independent of the age of their mother.1-2 Moreover, these increased risks are not confined to childhood and advanced paternal age has also been reported to be associated with a number of adverse outcomes in adult offspring, most notably schizophrenia and certain cancers (principally breast, prostate and leukaemia).3-5 It is hypothesised that these associations may be due to the accumulation of chromosomal aberrations and mutations during the maturation of male germ cells.6 Later reproduction is also leading to a trend towards smaller families. While it is known that morbidity and mortality often rise with increasing number of siblings, there is also evidence to suggest that children from smaller families, and in particular only children, have a health experience that is out of line with anticipated gradients with number of siblings, specific examples being high blood pressure and asthma.7-8",null,"Thursday, 9 December, 2010","Thursday, 9 December, 2010","Development, Offspring"

This will be investigated by measuring exposure to the natural environment using a combination of linked spatial environmental indicators and self-reported data. For example, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements will be used alongside subjective measurements of parks visits and outdoor time. This will assess exposure multi-dimensionally, by measuring how much an individual visits natural environments as well as the abundance of vegetation in their living environments.","The primary impact of this research will be to develop the evidence base on the connection between natural environments/ Greenspace and childhood development. Many studies in the field have been cross-sectional. Therefore adding a study with highly detailed temporal data will enhance the evidence base, particularly if submitted for publication in a high-quality journal.  

The variables available within ALSPAC will allow for the development of greenspace exposure metrics beyond what is often used in greenspace and health studies. This will help to understand which metrics (i.e. geospatial or self-reported metrics) are most appropriate; it will enable a greater understanding of what aspect(s) of the natural environment are likely to influence child development. For example, whether active usage or passive exposure is more prominent and at which stages of the life course may be more sensitive. Utilising this data will be impactful for ALSPAC and PEARL and display the increasing potential of linking cohort studies to geospatial data temporally.","Tuesday, 19 November, 2019","Thursday, 21 November, 2019","Epidemiology, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Statistical methods, Development, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution"

The role of epigenetics in these associations is beginning to be explored. The most robust and readily measured epigenetic modification is DNA methylation, which is a normal and mitotically heritable change that regulates gene activity in the absence of underlying changes to DNA sequences. Epigenetic analysis may provide new insights into the mechanisms through which genetic and environmental factors jointly contribute to shape risk profiles. Exploiting differences in levels of DNA methylation and also genetic variants correlated with methylation levels according to parental age might contribute to our understanding of the extent to which associations between parental age and offspring health-related outcomes are explained by socioeconomic or biological factors. Aims and objectives: The overall aim is to examine the association of parental age with offspring DNA methylation levels. Specific objectives are: 1.) Examine the association of maternal and paternal age with offspring DNA methylation patterns. 2.) Compare the association of maternal age and offspring DNA methylation with that of paternal age with offspring DNA methylation. 3.) Examine genetic variation around any methylated sites that are related to parental age to identify genetic variation that might be causally related to that methylation. 4.) If associations are found between maternal / paternal age with offspring DNA methylation we would then explore whether this mediates associations with adverse offspring health outcomes; this would involve standard association analyses methods and also (if possible) genetical genomics approaches.",null,"Thursday, 8 September, 2011","Thursday, 8 September, 2011","Epigenetics , Parental age, Maternal Age"

There is growing interest in clarifying the physiological mechanisms that link early experiences to health later in life (Taylor 2010); however, the majority of existing studies on this topic are retrospective and have a large window of time between the time of exposure and assessment of cardiovascular risk factors or health outcomes (Miller, Chen et al. 2009). Recent improvements in our understanding of atherosclerosis, and technologies to detect early indicators of CVD, have made it possible to identify risk factors among children and adolescents (Groner, Joshi et al. 2006). However, few studies have examined the association between early life adversity and CVD risk factors that emerge during the child and adolescent period. And, among existing studies, the majority have focused on socioeconomic factors (Batty and Leon 2002; Howe, Galobardes et al. 2010) to the exclusion of other types of stress exposures (e.g., family conflict, abuse, or acute stressful events). A related short-coming is that we have a limited understanding of the role of psychological health in the relationship between early adversity and development of CVD risk factors, despite substantial evidence that exposure to adversities negatively affects child mental health (Repetti, Taylor et al. 2002). The goal of the research described in our proposal is to address these gaps in knowledge by considering a range acute and chronic family-level adversities in relation to pro-inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6) and blood pressure (BP) measured during childhood and adolescence, and to examine the potential role of child mental health within this relationship.",null,"Monday, 22 November, 2010","Monday, 22 November, 2010","Behavioural Problems, Cardiovascular , Childhood Adversity"

The development of these models, built upon the best available evidence will enable robust comparative evaluations of alternative interventions that aim to reduce either the occurrence or severity of CM or DVA. The models will thus provide a framework upon which decision-makers can explore the impact of implementing alternative policies and identify the most cost-effective methods for addressing the consequences of CM and/or DVA.

Before the onset of foetal thyroid function in mid gestation, the foetus is completely dependent on the maternal supply of thyroid hormones, which play a crucial role in the foetal growth and development. The increased requirement of thyroid hormones by approximately 50% during pregnancy is a challenge for the maternal thyroid glands. Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that maternal thyroid dysfunction is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy. However, the association between maternal and offspring thyroid dysfunction were only investigated in single studies. The major disadvantage of existing studies included limited sample size and unavailability of confounding variables. This project aims to evaluate the association between maternal and offspring thyroid dysfunction in an individual cohort of larger sample size, with appropriate adjustment for confounding factors.

However, there is a lack of high quality empirical studies examining the effects of interacting with animals, in particular in relation to cognitive and educational outcomes. Furthermore, research into the effects of animal presence in these domains has largely been in the context of experimental investigation and short-term intervention therapy/activities, but the impact of actual pet ownership requires specific investigation. Little is known about the effect of pet ownership on emotional, behavioural, cognitive and educational development specifically in children, the population of greatest hypothesized importance. We propose to analyse a unique dataset of fourteen thousand children, to address the lack of high quality empirical studies examining the effects of interactions with animals on children, particularly in relation to cognitive, emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes such as: Self esteem (8yrs); ‘Key stage’ (attainment) results (ages 7, 11yrs) for children attending state schools; Separation Anxiety, Anxiety, depression (ages 7 and 10yrs); Attention, memory and cognition (ages 8, 10, 11yrs); and Language development (0-3yrs). Pet ownership, including number of each pet type was reported approximately every 18 months by the primary carer of the child prospectively from gestation until age 10. In conclusion, the ALSPAC dataset is a large and rich source of data from which to test for robust associations between pet ownership and cognitive, behavioural and educational outcomes.

These include variation in genetic data sharing processes, differences in information and participant consent and  genotyping platforms, which can be multiple within between and within studies.  This can represent a challenge for inter-disciplinary research, in particular for social science researchers interested in accessing genetic data.  Here we propose to catalogue meta-data (consent and response rates) around the genetic data available in each of the CLOSER studies; create a guidance document to enable researchers to access genetic data â this document should additionally serve to reduce the workload for the data sharing teams and finally to provide a demonstration project of the kind of analyses that can be done with the CLOSER studies on social-biological research, an important ESRC priority area. In particular we will include an in-depth focus on the development of genetic risk scores â here our proposed example is for body mass index and its interaction with social position.  Finally we wish to examine the new and growing concern in genetics research to adjust for sample bias or selection by social position in the analysis.",null,"Thursday, 31 August, 2017","Wednesday, 6 September, 2017","Social Science, Obesity, GWAS, Social science"

Identifying the key traits which predict this behaviour will allow the development of more efficient screening procedures and interventions for this vulnerable group, improving outcomes for both mother and foetus. While both psychological vulnerabilities (such as depression) and socioeconomic risk factors (such as material deprivation) have been considered individually in their relationship with smoking during pregnancy, the relative importance of psychological versus socioeconomic factors has not been determined. In addition, very few studies have considered the complex inter-relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and psychological wellbeing, and how these might contribute to smoking in pregnancy. The purpose of the present project is to use the ALSPAC dataset to address these two issues. Pregnant women in this dataset will be classed as either continuing smokers (smoked prior to pregnancy and continued during second and/or third trimesters), quit smokers (smoked prior to pregnancy but not during second or third trimesters), and never smokers (did not smoke prior to pregnancy or during pregnancy). Differences between these groups in psychological variables (depression, anxiety, and experience of stressful events during pregnancy) and socioeconomic variables (educational attainment, financial difficulties and neighbourhood deprivation) will be tested using multiple logistic regression. The second phase of this project will use network outcome analysis to map the complex inter-relationships between psychological and socioeconomic risk factors and smoking in pregnancy. This will allow us to identify the best targets for intervention.","The broad impact of this programme of research would be to encourage psychological researchers to engage to a greater extent with the socioeconomic aspects of their work, such that socioeconomic status is considered in parity to psychological wellbeing in models of addiction and interventions. This would represent a significant ideological shift within the addiction field.

A range of academic groups will benefit from the insights provided by the novel research in this project including:

1.Addiction theorists who seek to characterise the individual differences that contribute to tobacco dependence vulnerability, especially in pregnancy, or who seek to articulate general theoretical models of addiction.

2.Addiction theorists who are interested in behavioural economic models, in particular the role of deprivation and lack of alternative reinforcement as a key risk factor for addiction.

3.Researchers and clinical psychologists who are actively engaged in developing screening procedures and preventative therapies for substance dependence.

4.A number of psychological societies - including the Society for the Study of Addiction, the College on Problems of Drug Dependence, and the APA Society of Addiction Psychology- who seek to define mechanisms underpinning addiction.

5.A number of clinically-facing academic societies – including the British Thoracic Society, the Respiratory Medicine Section of The Royal Society of Medicine, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists – who seek to minimise the burden of disease stemming from smoking and addiction.

6.Antenatal services and general practitioners for whom this research would contribute to the development of screening procedures and preventative interventions for individuals identified as at high risk of smoking during pregnancy.","Saturday, 7 March, 2020","Tuesday, 10 March, 2020","Social Science, Addiction - smoking.

Although observational studies have shown very little evidence that antidepressant use during pregnancy is associated with congenital malformations (Jordan et al. 2016, Ban et al. 2014, O’Brien et al. 2008), there is increasing evidence suggesting a potential neurodevelopmental impact (Sullivan et al. 2013, Rai et al. 2013, Boukhris et al. 2013).

Studying outcomes in this area is made particularly difficult not only by the inability and impracticality of performing randomised control trials in pregnant women, but also the confounding by indication of depression itself in observational studies (Källén, 2012).  Another concern is the way risks regarding medication use in pregnancy are framed in the scientific literature and translations in the media, clinic and public health advice. This framing could contribute to mothers feeling guilty for treating their depression, thus potentially exacerbating their condition and its impact on their offspring.

In this project, we will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and epigenetic and genetic data from ALSPAC to triangulate evidence to examine and tease apart the potential links between untreated depression and antidepressant use with adverse pregnancy, birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes.",A better understanding of the relative effect of depression and anti-depressants on offspring health will be important evidence in informing public health messaging around pregnancy.,"Wednesday, 30 September, 2020","Monday, 5 October, 2020","Epidemiology, Developmental disorders - autism, Mental health, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Development, Epigenetics, Mothers - maternal age, menopause, obstetrics, Offspring"

Slight increases of levels of albumin excretion in urine (so called microalbuminuria) are related to an increased risk for renal and cardiovascular disease, even in otherwise healthy individuals. Nevertheless, the exact cause and the underlying mechanism of microalbuminuria are still unknown. Moreover, data on microalbuminuria in young individuals are scarce.

With this project we intend to learn more about the prevalence of microalbuminuria in school-aged children and young adults. We also want to test the hypothesis that some individuals have higher urinary albumin levels already early in life, that these findings persist in time and that such individuals carry a higher risk for renal, cardiovascular and, possibly, metabolic disease.

Moreover, we intend to explore possible causes of microalbuminuria, evaluating genetic background and associations between albuminuria and antenatal and postnatal determinants.

We plan to integrate the extensive data from the ALSPAC cohort with data from the Dutch GECKO birth-cohort (Groningen, The Netherlands), where urine samples have been collected at a younger age and thorough information about obesity risk factors are available. By investigating these two cohorts, we aim to gather data describing the spectrum of albuminuria from early childhood into young adulthood.","If the results of this research project will confirm that some individuals have high urinary albumin levels already early in life and that these findings persist in time, this could support the hypothesis of microalbuminuria as an expression of congenital endothelial dysfunction, leading to an increased renal, cardiovascular and possibly also metabolic risk.
It could also be possible to identify genetic risk profiles or antenatal and postnatal determinants.
This can have relevant consequences for health care policies (ex. extra controls for at risk groups or earlier therapeutic interventions where needed).

In mathematics, ratio and proportion are crucial for understanding linear functions; in science, some measure of quantities, such as density, velocity and temperature, are based on ratio and proportion. Similarly, the understanding of relationships between variables is of huge importance in mathematics as well as in science.

It has serious consequences for both the woman herself, and her family. PPD can have short term impacts, which can include feeling depressed, having difficulty performing normal tasks at home or work, and loss of interest in her new baby. It can also have long-term impacts, particularly for the children of women who are experiencing PPD. Research suggests that PPD and other mental health disorders affecting women who have just given birth can have serious economic implications, potentially costing up to Â£8.1 billion annually if the impacts on the children are considered (Bauer et al., 2014).

Recent research (Netsi et al, 2018) assessed long-term outcomes for mothers and offspring related to PPD using the ALSPAC data and found that severe PPD that persists past 8 months after birth is associated with an increased risk of negative outcomes for children on a large number of measures. We aim to build on their findings by evaluating whether early PPD (defined as PPD that occurs at the end of pregnancy and through 2 months following birth but which may resolve before the 8 month mark) similarly impacts long-term outcomes for women who have just given birth, their partners, and their children. We hope to track the impact of PPD on the likelihood of later depression for parents and children, as well as behavioral problems, antisocial behavior, psychosocial disorders, and academic achievement for children. We will use multivariate modeling techniques to account for factors that may confound the association.","Our analysis would estimate the relationship between early EPDS and study period EPDS, providing information pertinent to the potential impact of early interventions for PPD in women.  Additionally, we can assess how early intervention could affect longer term outcomes in children.  We would plan to publish the results in a high-impact journal to inform the research community.
Further, the results of this analysis could be used in a cost-effectiveness model assessing a potential new treatment for PPD for the NHS.  Sage Therapeutics is developing brexanolone, which is expected to be the first drug with an approved indication for PPD.  Brexanolone has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US and PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treatment of PPD.  A cost-effectiveness model is being developed to assess the value of brexanolone versus the standard of care.  A key component of that model is to link (a) the initial episode of maternal depression to (b) the long-term outcomes for mothers (e.g., continued depression) and their children (e.g., depression, mathematics scores) from PPD.  The research questions that we plan to pursue directly involve this relationship.","Wednesday, 12 September, 2018","Tuesday, 18 September, 2018","Health Economics, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Learning difficulty, Mental health, Computer simulations/modelling/algorithms, Birth outcomes, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Mothers - maternal age, menopause, obstetrics"

Additive ""nature"" and ""nurture"" models, while traditional and still used in many studies of heritability and family influence, mischaracterize how ability and health are manifested. Genes and environment cannot be meaningfully distinguished by traditional linear models that assign unique variances to each component. Abilities are produced, and gene expression is governed, by environmental conditions (see Rutter 2006).

Although there have been many studies concerning deafness in childhood, very few have examined the normal course and variation in hearing in a large population of individuals from an early age into mid and older adulthood. This is troubling since even low levels of hearing loss can result in failure to hear speech clearly, and can impact social communication, mental health and employment. Moreover hearing loss is associated with cognitive decline, and has been identified as one of the nine modifiable risk factors in the Lancet Commission on Dementia. It is not known whether hearing loss is a causal factor for cognitive decline, or a non-causal feature associated with ageing and neurodegeneration. Monitoring hearing in a population from early in life, and using novel genetic methods to investigate causality, may be crucial to understanding not just the role of hearing in cognitive function, but also the ageing process in general.","Contribute to the evidence base on the role of hearing loss on cognitive function, and potentially develop methods to unpick whether hearing loss has a causal role in cognitive decline.","Thursday, 15 August, 2019","Friday, 16 August, 2019","Sensory function/hearing loss, Cognitive impairment, ENT - hearing"

Its current growing rates translate into economical loses, with a reduction of the workforce and higher costs to the healthcare system. High cholesterol, obesity and a sedentary life are all lifestyle factors strongly associated with T2D, although they are not perfect indicators of disease risk. Family history of T2D is also an important factor to predict disease risk. Study of common genetic variants in the population has led to the discovery of more than 80 loci (genetic regions) associated with the disease, but they only explain 5% of the genetic risk. The aim of the present project is to strengthen the evidence of the genetic contribution to T2D by testing the association between levels of methylation in the DNA with prevalent and incident cases of T2D, the latter coming from the offspring of affected mums during the gestational period. Associations identified will be verified by the use of causative analyses. The advantage of using DNA methylation over common genetic variants is that they provide information about the cellular response to potentially stressful conditions, and also DNA methylation can archive priming signals of disease risk that could have been established early-on in development. Therefore, DNA methylation can provide more reliable data about a changing molecular environment associated with the development of T2 diabetes.",null,"Thursday, 4 February, 2016","Wednesday, 17 February, 2016","Epidemiology, Diabetes, Hypertension, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., coronary heart disease, Cell culture, Epigenetics, Gene expression, GWAS, Microarrays, RNA, Statistical methods, in situ prediction of gene expression

The end product of this collaboration is a sustainable data resource known as the EU Child Cohort Network.

In the proposed paper we provide a detailed description of the EU Child Cohort Networkâs core variables; a set of basic variables, derivable by the majority of participating cohorts and frequently needed as covariates in life-course research. We firstly describe the process adopted to establish a list of core variables and the protocol developed to harmonise these core data, thus making them interoperable. This protocol also defines the harmonisation process adopted generally within LifeCycle. Secondly, we describe the catalogue developed to ensure that all EU Child Cohort Network data are both findable and reusable. Finally, we describe the core data themselves, including the proportion of variables harmonised by each cohort and the number of children with harmonised data.

We would also like to provide some summary statistics (N and % for categorical variables, and N, mean, standard deviation for continuous variables) on some key variables (namely, sex, maternal education at baseline, motherâs ethnic background, motherâs parity, motherâs smoking in pregnancy, size for gestational age, whether the index child was ever breastfed, age of the mother at birth, birth weight and gestational age). These variables have already been harmonised as part of the LifeCycle project.

Two-sample Mendelian randomization is limited by unobserved pleiotropic effects of candidate variants which may explain trait effects independently of VDR binding.

This allows us to infer variants that are causal for physiological/disease trait variation via their effect on VDR binding.","Our research addresses a central problem in genetic epidemiology - the pleiotropic bias of the inferred causal effects. Separating the causal from the pleiotropic effects will allow us to identify variants that are causal via their effect on the binding of the Vitamin D Receptor. Identifying the causal effects at individual loci will reveal causal effects of Vitamin D that may be lost in studies examining the overall level of Vitamin D.

However, their simple classification undermines the complexity of these lipoproteins with respect to size, composition and roles in metabolic pathways. For example, results for the association between HDL and coronary heart disease (CHD) are mixed with regards to the direction of effect. Conversely, the association between genetic variants associated with LDL and CHD appear to be much more uniform. Therefore, If HDL is to be regarded as a valid biomarker for drug targets, all genetic variants associated with HDL should have a corresponding consistent effect.

To date, studies may lack power to determine the effect of HDL on CHD. In addition, HDL-C as conventionally measured may not be sufficient biomarker to allow associations to be revealed. Therefore, before discarding the potential of the HDL to CHD, it is worth considering additional biomarkers that better characterise the full complexity of the pathway.

This new project is based on using genetic variants residing in genes associated with HDL-C (as reported by the Global Lipid Consortium) and testing their association with HDL related NMR metabolites. In addition, we are extending our analyses to test the association between HDL related genetic variants and scores developed from HDL metabolites which were generated using factor analysis, in order to determine whether any consistencies exist between the direction of effect and factors of HDL metabolites.",null,"Thursday, 23 July, 2015","Friday, 14 August, 2015","Genetics, CHD, Metabolomics, NMR, Cardiovascular, Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc."

Health behaviours and health status developed in adolescence often endure into adulthood and influence life expectancy. Health-risk behaviours such as excessive alcohol consumption and physical inactivity are not only linked with mental health, but are also two major contributors (globally) to disease in adulthood such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adolescence is a time when physical activity levels decline, alcohol consumption increases and mental health states can deteriorate. However, conversely, research shows links between higher physical activity levels and higher levels of alcohol consumption (although largely this has been derived from non UK-based University/College populations). Advice given by a former UK Chief Medical Officer is that children should not drink at all before the age of 18 but certainly not before the age of 15. Excessive alcohol consumption can result in unwanted consequences (particularly in adolescence) such as being a perpetrator or victim of violence or other criminal activity, or unprotected (or regretted) sexual activity. Alcohol has been strongly linked to suicide in adolescence (the number one cause of preventable death); as well as more generally impacting or impeding healthy brain development. Other factors (which contribute to or cause inequalities in health outcomes) also should be considered when looking at health behaviours in adolescence e.g. socioeconomic status (SES), educational attainment, gender and psychosocial health. Those with a lower SES (SES - being typically derived from household income and education levels) tend to fare worse in health outcomes. Despite higher levels of physical activity being associated with higher SES in adolescence (as is a higher level of alcohol consumption), it appears that higher educational attainment (also correlated with higher SES) reduces the occurrence or frequency of binge-drinking. While those from lower SES backgrounds are more likely to experience greater harms from alcohol consumption. Gender contributes significantly to health inequalities, disadvantaging girls. In early adolescence, girls are more likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety or depressive disorder, more likely to have lower levels of physical activity and are more likely to be at risk of alcohol-related harm than their male equivalents. Mental health is becoming one of the biggest issues we face globally and has been strongly linked to physical activity/inactivity. Those that undertake regular physical activity are less likely to be depressed, but conversely are more likely to consume alcohol at higher levels (and in particular binge-drink). This research will seek to untangle the links between risk of alcohol-related harm and levels of physical activity at ages 13.5, 15.5 and 17.5 using data in the âChildren of the 90âs cohortâ from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The research will determine associations or patterns at each time-point (age in years) and also make comparisons of changes over time. The individual-level analysis (longitudinal) will also utilise data for 24.5 year olds to compare with 17.5 year olds The following factors will be used as a means of explaining findings at each time-point, individually, and collectively: SES, educational attainment, gender and psychosocial  health. The aim is to create new knowledge on the associations and patterns between physical activity and alcohol consumption levels across early to late adolescence in a UK population. Findings will inform further UK-based research on this topic.",Currently there is an absence of evidence in UK adolescents on the association between physical activity levels and alcohol consumption (particularly in early adolescence). This research will not only contribute to empirical evidence in this area but will also help to identify a population (or populations) that could benefit from early preventative measures to delay or prevent the onset of alcohol consumption during the critical early adolescence period.,"Wednesday, 10 June, 2020","Wednesday, 10 June, 2020","Biostatistics, behavioural science and prevention, Alcohol related harm

Together, these conditions are the major cause of preventable death globally. Researchers now know that the underlying processes for developing cardiometabolic diseases can begin at an early age. A large part cardiometabolic health is linked to lifestyle factors, and dietary habits throughout the life span are an important modifiable factor. Previous studies have shown that different dietary patterns and qualities of the diet can influence cardiometabolic health. Evidence also suggests that habitual âunhealthyâ eating patterns can lead to a chronic inflammatory state (because certain nutrients and foods produce an inflammatory response in the body), and chronic low-grade inflammation has been linked to numerous chronic diseases. Finally, dietary habits are intricately connected to obesity, and obesity is related to both cardiometabolic health and chronic inflammation.","This study should help gain a clearer understanding of the complex relationship between different aspects of diet quality, chronic low-grade inflammation and cardiometabolic alternations in children and young adults, where research is greatly lacking. It should also provide insight into some of the biological pathways involved through low-grade inflammation. It will provide an indication of the cardiometabolic health and inflammatory state of young adults in this UK region and sociodemographic group, and prevalence of high-risk levels. We expect our findings to contribute to the scientific evidence needed to develop effective preventative strategies and identify and manage at risk groups, where there is a particular shortfall in clinical and public health practice. For instance, the results could help when designing specific dietary interventions targeted at high-risk children and adolescents to reduce their chance of developing cardiometabolic diseases later in adulthood. Finally, the research will provide data on a set of key inflammatory biomarkers that should facilitate future research in ALSPAC involving these biomarkers, which are involved in numerous health outcomes.","Wednesday, 1 August, 2018","Tuesday, 7 August, 2018","Epidemiology, Cardiometabolic health, Microarrays, Cardiovascular"

Sleep fragmentation and sleep loss have been associated with emotional dysregulation (4), increased psychosis (5), and higher risk-taking behaviours, including substance abuse (6). Adolescents are particularly exposed to the risk of developing substance use disorders (SUDs) and related psychiatric comorbidities (7,8), hence it is particularly important to measure to what extent and how adolescent chronic sleep restriction contributes to the development of such mental disorders. So far, longitudinal analysis using ALSPAC data have found that less total sleep time at age 15 years predicts symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression later in life (9). However, the prospective association between adolescent sleep and development of SUDs has not been explored.

One of the mechanisms through which sleep loss can affect brain function is by inducing epigenetic changes, dynamic modifications that can powerfully regulate gene expression, without changing the heritable genetic sequences. Epigenetic changes in the form of DNA methylation have been associated with both altered sleeping patterns (10,11) and SUDs in adults (12-15). Our goal is to determine whether adolescent sleep patterns predict the risk of developing SUDs later in life and to what extent epigenetic changes are associated with both adolescent chronic sleep restriction and drug consumption. Since, despite recent declines, alcohol remains the substance most widely used by today’s teenagers, this research proposal will focus on alcohol drinking and alcohol use disorders. The results of this analysis will guide future causal experiments to identify the biological mechanisms mediating the consequences of sleep loss and to develop new strategies to reduce alcohol abuse and improve mental health.","The results of this analysis will help us determine the role of adolescent sleep patterns in contributing to the development of substance use disorders and related psychiatric comorbidities, informing the public and policy makers on the importance of promoting a correct sleep hygiene to reduce future health problems. The EWAS in adolescents with altered sleep patterns will help identifying possible biomarkers for chronic sleep restrictions and point us towards some of the biological processes mediating the negative effects of poor sleep. These processes will be further investigated in the future by designing causal experiments in animal models that will allow to target separate molecular components and identify their contribution to the development of substance use disorders. Our final goal is to find novel therapeutic strategies to counteract the negative consequences of adolescent sleep impairment, reduce alcohol abuse and improve mental health.","Friday, 23 October, 2020","Tuesday, 27 October, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Mental health, Statistical methods, Epigenetics"

(ii) What are the genetic and environmental factors that influence the clinical trajectories of the patients? (iii) What are the specific brain processes involved? To address some of these questions, we will investigate the genetic and phenotypic data of the ALSPAC cohort to understand how genetic mutations in autism/NDD associated genes can have different consequences on the cognitive development of the individuals depending on the genetic and environmental background. Beyond improving our knowledge on the genetic architecture of autism/NDDs, our project should also lead to the identification of protective factors explaining how some individuals are resilients to strongly deleterious mutations.","This project addresses questions that are recurrently asked by clinical geneticists working in the field of NDDs. When a mutation is detected, what is the outcome of the patient? Can we have a better prediction of the clinical trajectory of the patients? We will provide a better genetic and phenotypic characterization of the carriers of the deleterious mutations and identify “protective factors” that could compensate the severity of the mutation.

The ways in which these messages actually influence the diet of the population and the effect on the risk of diseases such as heart disease have not been studied over the long-term.

The results will allow us to assess whether general publicity about ‘healthy’ diet leads to any meaningful change in dietary habits and whether this has any long-term effect on CVD risk. We will also be able to assess whether the use of dietary index scores is able to detect meaningful dietary change and which of the four scores tested are most able to predict a heart healthy diet in English women. If the impact of general advice is demonstrated to have improved eating habits and improved CVD risk this will encourage further general publicity. However, if no effect on diet or CVD risk is detected it will indicate that more finely targeted measures to improve diet should be developed.","Tuesday, 30 June, 2020","Tuesday, 30 June, 2020","Epidemiology, Nutrition

Additionally, current treatment options have limited effectiveness, highlighted by the observation that only 30% of adult patients with AN fully recover. The development of EDs is highly complex and driven by environmental and genetic factors. Previous research has suggested that EDs run in families, but the specific genetic variants associated with risk for EDs are not well understood. Twin studies have shown that the heritability for EDs ranges from 40%-70%. Similarly, to other psychiatric disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia, many genetic variants with relatively small effect underlie the overall genetic risk for EDs. Due to the nature of these effects, extremely large sample sizes are necessary which can only be amassed by international efforts. For AN previous large scale genetic studies, comparing patients with healthy controls, have been successful in pinpointing genetic variants associated with the illness (Duncan et al., 2017). However, no such attempts have been made regarding BN or BED and the field of EDs is lacking behind the genomic discovery of other psychiatric disorders. The success of these studies, which search across the entire genome to find associated genetic markers, is highly dependent on the number of patients and controls included in the research because the sample sizes defines the statistical power to detect significant associations. Thus, worldwide joint forces are necessary to combine datasets to boost sample sizes. Therefore, we propose to include ALSPAC participants in the international approach: Using the rich database of ALSPAC to identify patients diagnosed with AN, BN or BED and add them to international cohorts examining the genetic architecture of EDs. The findings may provide a better understanding of the development of EDs and may help to identify or new treatment strategies including potential targets for pharmaceutical treatment.","The identification of genomic variants associated with EDs may enable researcher to understand the underlying biology and may ultimately inform the development of new treatments. Only one FDA-approved medication targets the core symptoms of an eating disorder (in this case binge eating) and mortality is high. An international collaboration lead by the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED) with the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI) and iPsych (Denmark) has found eight loci for anorexia nervosa with promising single gene loci being potential druggable targets. We also see that anorexia has strong psychiatric and metabolic genetics, suggesting a reconceptualization of the illness is needed. We seek to perform a meta-analysis of our GWAS results with ALSPAC to extend genomic discovery in all eating disorders. We aim to improve detection, prevention, and ultimately to develop cures to reduce and ultimately eliminate mortality from eating disorders.","Monday, 21 December, 2020","Thursday, 14 January, 2021","Genetics, Eating disorders - anorexia, bulimia"

Yet our understanding of these relationships remains patchy and much remains to be explored. This project takes an interdisciplinary approach and integrates theoretical perspectives from sociology, social and clinical biopsychology and neuroscience. To-date, the number of empirical studies, which considered at least one measure of sex hormones and at least one set of socialisation factors or applied other innovative designs to shed light on the interaction of hormonal and socialisation influences, are limited (e.g., Berenbaum, Bryk and Beltz 2012; Davis and Risman 2015; Hines et al. 2002; Udry 2000). Drawing on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we will investigate how prenatal sex hormones and gendered parental environments and role modelling influence childrenâs interests in school subjects at different ages and the gender (a)typicality of their occupational aspirations and actual choices during adolescence and young adulthood. We extend the current literature by using prospective reports by parents and children over longer periods from early childhood to young adulthood. The findings will contribute to a better understanding as to what extent malleable environmental conditions may be more or less effective in altering gender differences in childrenâs identities, academic and occupational aspirations and choices.","What do you think the likely impact of your research will be?
The results will provide important interdisciplinary evidence and extend our understanding of interdependencies of sex hormones and parental socialisation in shaping children’s gender development. We will present these finding at various international sociological and psychological conferences, which will contribute to spreading interdisciplinary theoretical and empirical approaches of gender development and socialisation.

Foetuses are especially vulnerable to prenatal exposure since mercury can cross the placental barrier and the blood brain barrier is not fully developed until several months after birth. Prenatal exposure to Hg has been associated with impaired foetus development, such as reduced placental functioning and foetal growth. Prenatal exposure to Hg has also been associated with effects on child neuropsychological development. The specific mechanisms of toxicity related to these associations remain unclear, although some research has suggested that dramatic DNA methylation changes and epigenetic remodelling during early embryogenesis could be involved. Thus, cells and tissues acquire new methylation patterns that may persist in foetal development and childhood. To date, only three studies have been conducted relating Hg and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in cord blood with sample sizes between 138 and 321. These studies have identified altered expression in unique genomic regions as well as methylation changes in specific CpG sites.

People who suffer maltreatment have a higher risk of many health conditions, including obesity, heart attack and stroke. However, it is not well understood why this is the case and at what age ill health starts to manifest. Unhealthy eating, smoking, physical inactivity and inadequate sleep may play a role in this relationship, but mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, inflammation and other biological factors can also be involved. These factors might have separate effects but also act together, and these mechanisms might differ between men and women. This research aims to understand when the cardiovascular consequences of maltreatment appear, the pathways that link childhood maltreatment to heart disease in later life and whether these mechanisms differ by sex. This will help to identify potential targets for interventions to prevent heart disease in those who suffered maltreatment. We will use data from several British studies (ALSPAC, UK Biobank, the 1958 British Birth Cohort, Millennium Cohort and Growing up in Scotland), that have assessed maltreatment in early life and have measures of cardiovascular health indicators at different ages to understand when, why and how people who suffered maltreatment in childhood have a higher risk of heart disease in later life.","Childhood maltreatment is common, and there is a robust association between maltreatment and several adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Understanding when this association emerges and the mechanisms that link childhood maltreatment to cardiometabolic outcomes will improve our understanding of the aetiology of CVD, and will inform prevention efforts, thus reducing the burden of CVD in some of the most vulnerable people in society.  By identifying and quantifying the contribution of multiple mediating factors, such as diet, physical activity, sleep, mental health and inflammation, to the association between childhood maltreatment and CVD, we will identify potential targets for interventions aimed at secondary prevention of CVD in maltreated individuals.

Factors acting across the lifecourse from in-utero to older age influence skeletal health and our previous research suggests early-life skeletal loading may be important for healthy skeletal development. For example, we have shown that children who reach motor milestones, e.g. walking, jumping, at older ages than average have smaller, weaker bones and different joint shapes even in adolescence and old age. We postulate that this is due to both delayed early-life leg loading and because late walkers tend to be less active throughout life which also affects skeletal health.

Skeletal growth is quickest during the intrauterine period, when the skeleton is first assembled.  However, there is little information on how skeletal loading during intrauterine development influences bone health. Objective assessment of fetal movements are difficult, but fetal position â breech or cephalic â will influence movements with these likely to be lower in breech infants as leg movement is constrained. Our research, and that of others supports this, showing that breech-born babies have smaller bones and different hip shape at birth compared to cephalic-born children.  However, it is unclear whether these differences continue into later childhood, and whether they are explained by differences in activity post-birth.

Young people engaging in dual harm are likely to have specific clinical and support needs. However, very little is known about their characteristics and how individuals who have dual harmed differ from those who self-harm and those who are violent. Understanding the characteristics of people with dual harm experiences will help design services to meet their needs.

We will use data from the ALSPAC to look at differences between young people reporting self-harm, violence towards others, dual harm and neither behaviours at age 16. We are interested in differences in depression, attitudes towards violence, being exposed to self-harm and violence in the home or among peers, impulsivity, self-esteem, callous-unemotional traits, behavioural and emotional dysregulation and body image. We will then look at young people who report either self-harm or violence at age 16 and go on to report dual harm in young adulthood. We expect that their characteristics will differ from those who do not transition to dual harm.","Young people engaging in dual harm have particularly raised risks of premature mortality (3) and higher rates of psychiatric disorder (1). While there has been extensive research into characteristics and risk factors among young people who have self-harmed, very little is known about young people who move from engaging in self-harm or violence towards others to dual harm. The findings of this study will help shed light on this highly vulnerable population. Understanding the distinct characteristics of this group is the first step in developing appropriate support and clinical interventions.

Not all individuals with ADHD have the same problems though, so it is important to understand who is at greatest risk of them. Difficulties with attention or hyperactivity are present across many people whilst only some have sufficient problems to be diagnosed with ADHD.

This limited evidence-base means that much of the current public health advice given to pregnant women is inconsistent, confusing and may potentially even be harmful. Additionally, there is emerging evidence that a man's behaviour can influence the health of their unborn children, but very little public health advice is currently offered to fathers-to-be, and the scientific evidence is even more scant.","This project has the potential to have significant and far-reaching impact. It aims to produce evidence for effective advice and interventions on maternal and paternal health behaviours in the prenatal period. Ultimately, achieving this aim will lead to improved health outcomes in children.

The research focuses on health behaviours that can be considered ""modifiable"" in order to maximise the potential for effective interventions. The range of childhood outcomes considered is purposefully broad to reflect the potential far-reaching consequences of perturbations during development.

Beneficiaries and potential impacts of this research are outlined below:

-NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL POLICYMAKERS
This research will benefit policymakers (e.g. those involved with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE) in making evidence-based policy decisions regarding prenatal public health advice. This is in line with the UK parliamentary 1001 Critical Days Campaign, a cross-party manifesto to support and establish universal and specialist provision to offer services to parents and their babies from conception to age 2, which states that ""it is vital that a focus on the early years is placed at the heart of the policy making process"".

-CHARITIES
Charities that support parents, particularly around pregnancy, have called for more research and more evidence-based advice to be given to parents in the prenatal period, and will therefore benefit from this research. For example: the British Pregnancy Advice Service (BPAS) invited me to a workshop in September 2017 where we discussed current prenatal advice and potential implications for the autonomy of women; ""NCT"" is a charity to support parents by providing them with accurate, impartial information, including research summaries; Maternity Action is the UK's leading charity committed to ending inequality and improving the health and well-being of pregnant women, partners and young children, from conception through to the child's early years; The Fatherhood Institute is a UK-based think tank whose objectives include collating, publishing and mobilising international research on fathers and their impact on children and mothers, shaping national and local policy to ensure a father-inclusive approach and producing briefs for MPs about evidence on the importance of fathers in the period from conception to age two.

-HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 
Midwives, GPs, paediatricians and other allied healthcare professionals who provide support for parents and children will benefit from a better evidence-base to their clinical practice.

-THE GENERAL PUBLIC
Over 700,000 babies are conceived each year in England and Wales and at least 130 million babies are born each year worldwide. The huge number of individuals who are considering having a baby or have an unplanned pregnancy will benefit from more effective, more consistent public health advice in the prenatal period, and their offspring will benefit through enhanced health and social outcomes in childhood. This is likely to have a knock-on effect into adulthood and therefore on public health and the economy.","Tuesday, 29 May, 2018","Tuesday, 5 June, 2018","Epidemiology, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Congenital abnormalities, Learning difficulty, Obesity, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc."

It is unclear with such associations, however, whether these findings represent causal effects of sclerostin, or confounding.  Mendelian randomization offers an approach to estimating causal effects in the presence of such confounding.

Once common variants robustly associated with serum sclerostin levels are detected it is possible to apply two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses to predict the effect of influencing serum sclerostin on a very wide range of outcomes, utilising the available GWAS data from a large number of conditions that could be influenced by serum sclerostin modification.

Requirements for a comprehensive investigation applying this approach to sclerostin would be (1) assaying sclerostin on a large sample of GWAS’d study participants to produce reliable data of genetic associations with serum sclerostin, (2) performing two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses predicting the effect of modifying sclerostin on a wide variety of health-related outcomes (see appendix for a summary of accessible resources), (3) within single large samples with particularly informative phenotyping (such as ALSPAC and UK Biobank) performing a detailed analysis of the predicted effects of modifying sclerostin.

These data would then provide powerful GWAS assessment of genetic associations with sclerostin as well as the basis for a comprehensive investigation of the association of sclerostin with a wide range pf phenotypes.

Popular theories of ADHD assume that ADHD symptoms are caused by the dysfunction of specific neuro-cognitive mechanisms like the ability to represent and learn from positive and negative feedback (also called prediction errors) or the ability to hold information for further manipulation in the working memory. These neuro-cognitive functions depend on the availability of neurotransmitters (signalling molecules), in particular dopamine, in the brain. Yet, even though there is ample evidence for genetic influence on neurotransmitter availability, and twin studies indicate the heritability of ADHD, the specific genetic contributions to ADHD remain poorly understood.

This project shall use a “computational psychiatry” approach to improve the understanding the specific genetic contributions to ADHD. Computational psychiatry uses mathematical models of cognition and learning that are consistent with behavioural and neurobiological data to identify which neuro-cognitive sub-processes cause impaired learning or cognition. For example, impaired reward-based learning could be explained by the inability to learn from positive feedback or feedback, or to the inability to make choices consistent with learned reward-values. Low performance in cognitive tests could be caused by a low ability (resulting e.g. from noisy working memory representations), or by a preference for fast as opposed to accurate responding.

Because the mathematical models employed in this project have been shown to be good models of the cognitive and neuro-biological processes underlying learning and decision making, they can build a bridge between ADHD symptoms and genes by showing how neuro-cognitive deficits underlying ADHD are in turn associated with genes. We expect stronger associations between neuro-cognitive processes and genes than between ADHD-Symptoms and genes, because the former are likely more directly influence by genes.

Hence, our goals are to describe ADHD phenotypes in terms of neuro-cognitive sub processes obtained through mathematical modelling and to identify genes associated with these phenotypes.

For this aim we will model data from neuropsychological and experimental tests collected in the ALSPAC Teen focus data collections to first identify in which neuro-cognitive processes ADHD patients have the most important deficits. In a second step, we will investigate genetic associations for the neuro-cognitive processes with the largest deficits.",null,"Thursday, 11 May, 2017","Tuesday, 16 May, 2017","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Attention deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), GWAS, Computational modelling of task data

If we could understand genetic mechanisms we may be able to use this knowledge to develop better treatments.

Studies carried out in large populations (including ALSPAC participants) have shown which regions of DNA may contribute to causing eczema. We have tested these regions in the lab and shown, using skin samples grown in an incubator, that genes which are switched on or off in skin can cause eczema or protect against eczema.

Four work streams will focus on particular objectives as follows:  1. To identify risk and protective factors associated with language and literacy outcomes. In particular we will identify: how speech, language, literacy and cognitive variables cluster and change during childhood; to what extent do language learning and literacy difficulties persist to school leaving age predictors of language and literacy performance at school leaving age; mechanisms and characteristics by which social class impacts upon children's language and literacy during preschool, primary school and at school leaving. 2. To identify the relationship between young people's current and past performance in language and literacy and their decisions about social activities, further education and future employment as they leave school.  We aim to identify the  patterns of social, educational and employment outcomes at school leaving age that are related to different language learning and literacy trajectories; social conditions that predict young people's perceptions of their own functional language and literacy performance and outcomes. 3. To identify the prevalence of conduct and behaviour disorders, risk taking and criminal offending behaviours in relation to young people's current and past performance in language and literacy. In particular we will identify any subgroups of speech, language and literacy deficits that are associated with raised occurrence of psychopathology and /or conduct disorders and at what age the mental health impact become apparent. 4. To identify the current and predicted social costs and return on investment to society as a whole from support of children's language and literacy skills development through professional involvement of speech and language services. Particular objectives include: What is the relationship between GCSE performance outcomes and the level of support in childhood for language and literacy skills development and how does this translate to economic resource savings in the UK economy?  To identify whether children with language and literacy difficulties who have received support in childhood through the professional involvement of speech and language services choose higher skill occupation destinations than who have not received such support and, if so, what are the social costs incurred? To identify the economic benefits in monetary terms of professional involvement in language and literacy skills support for emotionally and socially vulnerable young people.

Mothers rely on nutrients to maintain their physiological condition and immune system, as well as to nourish developing young. A key question is: when mothers face challenges to their physiological state, how do they adjust energy allocation to protect themselves and their young? When does this result in adverse outcomes, such as pre-term birth?  To date, most research on pregnancy and immunity involves longitudinal studies in humans or experiments on laboratory rodents. We have a solid understanding of how nutrition or inflammation in pregnancy influences birth timing, offspring physiology and behaviour. Surprisingly few studies have, however, considered the interaction between nutrition and inflammation. This project will aim to fill this gap by using a diverse toolkit: evolutionary models, experiments in insect models of pregnancy, and analyses of human cohort studies.","This project will provide fundamental insights on how maternal nutrition and immune responses interact to determine pregnancy outcomes and longer-term consequences for offspring, across diverse organisms.

By 2050, five billion people- half the world’s population- will be short-sighted, compared to ~1.4 billion people today.

People with myopia have relatively long eyes, so that light is focused in front of the retina instead of directly onto it. Since the eye continues to grow throughout childhood, someone who develops myopia as a child will continue to get worse as they grow older, with greater risk of sight-threatening complications.

Previously, we showed that for each additional year we spend in education, the more myopic we become, on average, as a population. Evidence from other studies suggests that this may be because we spend less time outside, reducing our exposure to natural daylight. Other risk factors for myopia include the time we spend on near work, urbanization, socioeconomic position, diet, pregnancy-related factors and genetics. Children with myopia tend to engage in less physical activity, but physical activity alone is not protective against myopia.

Myopia is more prevalent in countries adopting a Western diet and lifestyle, and many of the genes that increase the risk of myopia are involved in insulin/glucose signalling and obesity/fat metabolism.  Insulin signalling also appears to influence the normal growth of the eye.  As the Western diet is linked to greater intake of food with higher energy loads, one hypothesis is that compensatory increases in blood glucose and insulin levels send increased growth signals to the eyes.

This project aims to determine how genetic and environmental factors interact with insulin signalling to affect myopia.  Changes in insulin signalling happen naturally in children around puberty, and so we would like to use information in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children on eye growth, glasses prescriptions, blood levels of glucose and insulin before, during and after puberty on thousands of children followed prospectively from birth, to find out how they interact to affect eye growth. Additionally, there are normal variants in our genes that influence fasting levels of insulin and glucose and we will find out how these genetic variants are linked to myopia.  These analyses should provide novel insights into the relationship between insulin signalling and myopia, and have the potential to identify novel targets for treatment.","The above analyses will help us determine whether genetic and environmental changes in insulin/IGF1 signalling are major determinants of axial growth in children and myopia pathogenesis.  If so, they would explain how myopia is linked to increasing urbanisation, diet, BMI, height and PHV during puberty, and why GWAS and studies of animal models of myopia implicate insulin/IGF pathways.  They might also point the way to novel therapies for myopia that target downstream effector molecules in the insulin/IGF1 signalling pathway, e.g. PI3K/AKT.  The efficacy of topical atropine eye drops for myopia suggests that local or topical delivery routes could be an option","Wednesday, 28 October, 2020","Friday, 30 October, 2020","Genetic epidemiology (including association studies and mendelian randomisation), Diabetes, GWAS, Statistical methods, Ageing, Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Nutrition - breast feeding, diet, Puberty, Statistical methods, Vision, BMI, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Epigenetics, Genetic epidemiology, Genetics, Genome wide association study, Hormones - cortisol, IGF, thyroid, Mendelian randomisation"

Also limited is evidence how this risk may be ameliorated by other factors, including health and social care interventions. This lack of evidence mainly reflects the difficulty of studying these questions in population based studies. ALSPAC represents an opportunity to overcome these difficulties. From a population based sample of nearly 14,000 children recruited before birth Children in Need up to age 6 were identified from study data and from linkage to Child Health Records. Children who subsequently became Looked After are identified in the National Pupil Database to which ALSPAC participants are linked.

Finding data to underpin such analyses, however, is extremely difficult indeed. Much COVID incidence goes completely unreported; even the largest studies are limited to tiny fractions of the population, and biased towards specific demographics; and generalized studies have to use either tip-of-the-iceberg medical statistics (ONS, NHS), fine-grained but unsustainable self-reporting technologies (e.g. KCL’s COVID Symptom Study app), or broad brush behavioural data (e.g. Google COVID-19 mobility reports, Social media data).

1. To establish the potential of behavioural signals (held in mass, and readily anonymizable, transactional datasets) to shed light on public health risks, such as COVID-19 (and underpin new forms of syndromic surveillance tools, providing capabilities for early-warning systems at scale; sustainably; and without reliance on self-reporting apps).
2. To uncover potentially hidden impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable and under-examined communities (e.g. BAME, areas of Food Poverty, Deprivation)
3. To demonstrate the importance of transparency, security and privacy-by-design in data linkage systems, through open frameworks connecting key stakeholders: health services, researchers, private-sector data holders, and individuals/communities themselves.

This project will explore how and in what ways birth cohorts are technologies of and for biosocial research. Longitudinal studies that follow the lives of participants and their families have become central to identifying and understanding how the social âgets under the skinâ, making them important but, as yet, under researched arenas in social science for examining the social practices, cultural contexts and consequences of biosocial research.","The outlined five year project taking six regional birth cohorts in diverse international contexts as an object of and subject for ethnographic inquiry will generate in-depth anthropologically rich comparative accounts of the dynamics between birth cohorts and biosocial research within the global north and south.

An ongoing challenge is how to best identify individuals in the clinically âsilentâ stage of this disease.","Clinical trials for Alzheimer’s Disease are shifting in focus towards preventative treatments at the earliest disease stage, however, identifying individuals prior to symptom onset is an ongoing challenge limited by a reliance on existing pen-and-paper neuropsychological tools. Mezurio has been developed as part of a collaborative approach between academia and industry to create sensitive, digital behavioural paradigms to measure cognition longitudinally in a home environment. Long-term, this measure may be implemented and accepted by healthcare professionals as a means of recognising the first symptoms of disease, as well as aiding with recruitment to clinical trials. Establishing normative performance on this task in the GameChanger study, including how task performance varies across demographic groups, is a necessary step in establishing Mezurio as a prescreening tool. 

In addition, GameChanger provides valuable exploration of how risk factors (genetic, health, lifestyle) differentially impact cognition across the lifespan. Digital biomarkers provide a unique opportunity for administering sensitive behavioural paradigms at scale, advancing cohorts which have traditionally relied on brief in-clinic assessments at infrequent time intervals. By testing the feasibility of collecting longitudinal cognitive data in a general population, GameChanger will establish the utility of digital tools for studying cognition.","Friday, 18 May, 2018","Saturday, 19 May, 2018","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Cognitive impairment, Digital phenotyping, Ageing, Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Cognition - cognitive function, Digital Health"

Eczema is a major contributor to years lost due to disability worldwide and globally the burden of eczema continues to increase, currently affecting 20% of children in developed countries. Eczema is complex, with varied clinical presentations and different responses to treatment. Traditionally eczema is divided into subtypes with and without allergy; however this approach is suboptimal. The recent discovery of the importance of genes regulating the skin barrier in eczema have led to a major change in understanding why eczema occurs and how it is characterized. Individuals with mutations in filaggrin, a protein essential for skin barrier function, are more likely to have earlier onset, more persistent therapy-resistant disease. The recent trials of dupilumab biological therapy for severe eczema highlighted that despite improvement in eczema with active treatment, only 40% of individuals had clear/almost clear skin at 12 weeks, and responses were not predictable based on allergy or filaggrin status, suggesting that a deeper understanding of disease subtypes is now critical. Failure to identify eczema subtypes limits the development of prevention strategies, as it hinders our understanding of why eczema develops. It also contributes to our current suboptimal treatment strategies for eczema, which rely on intensive topical therapy and broad immunosuppressive therapies for severe disease.  If we had better understanding of the different eczema subtypes, (as now exists for asthma), we could determine if different risk factors and treatments are relevant for both the onset and the treatment of these different eczema subtypes. Subtyping eczema is timely given the novel drugs targeting specific pathways currently being developed for eczema treatment

There has been a paradigm shift in how eczema is perceived, from being considered a transient disorder of childhood to an understanding that eczema is a systemic inflammatory disorder. Systemic inflammatory disorders may be associated with adverse health and social outcomes, including cardiovascular disorders and impairment of their educational and occupational attainment. There are emerging signals that eczema may be associated with adverse medical outcomes, including strokes and heart attacks. However current studies are limited by the use of cross-sectional designs or by important differences between people that have eczema and people without eczema that may be associated with adverse outcomes, for example adiposity or treatment effects. Different subtypes of eczema may have differing associations with adverse health and social outcomes and may respond differently to treatments as different biological pathways may mediate disease. This research will determine if adverse effects are associated with eczema overall or restricted to certain disease subtypes. Given the high prevalence of eczema, detecting if people with eczema (or specific subtypes of eczema) are at increased risk of adverse outcomes is critically important as it could rapidly inform prevention and/or screening strategies.

Aims

1.	To create a new phenotypic classification of eczema in birth cohort data that may be associated with medical and social outcomes and responses to treatment

2.	To determine if people with eczema overall and eczema subtypes specifically have an increased risk of cardiac events and poorer educational attainment, and, if increased risks are detected, to establish the predictors of increased risk

Design and methods

1.	I will use available social, family and medical data from a subgroup of participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) prospective birth cohort study (N =250 eczema cases; N = 50 controls) to creating a new phenotypic classification of eczema (subtypes) in birth cohort data.

2.	I will also use cohort study designs to determine if individuals with eczema and specific subtypes have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. I will do this by looking at the relationship between eczema and cardiometabolic risk factors in ALSPAC

3.	I will use data from ALSPAC to determine if individuals with eczema and specific eczema subtypes are at increased risk of poorer educational and occupational attainment and if this is mediated by treatment.",null,"Monday, 4 January, 2016","Wednesday, 6 January, 2016","Epidemiology, Dermatology, Methods - e.g. cross cohort analysis, data mining, mendelian randomisation, etc., Statistical methods"

The covid-19 pandemic potentially threatens to worsen these health inequalities. The ‘lockdown’ changed people’s behaviour radically, but the socioeconomic differences in these experiences are not well understood. Some groups of society may have increased health-promoting behaviours – for example, engaging in more physical activity and preparing more food within the home. Other groups may have experienced adverse changes in health-related behaviours – for example, smoking more or consuming more alcohol in response to the stress and anxiety induced by the pandemic. It is possible these differences are socioeconomically patterned, and could therefore worsen pre-existing inequalities. Another key factor likely to influence patterns of behaviour change during the pandemic is household/family structure. For example, parents with children and individuals shielding or living with a household member who was shielding may have been less able to engage with health-promoting behaviours.",understanding of inequalities in relation to covid-19 lockdown,"Wednesday, 16 September, 2020","Tuesday, 22 September, 2020",Epidemiology

Yet there is surprisingly little evidence regarding the developmental function of early sleep patterning to guide care practice. Current understanding of the processes underpinning the normative transition from multiple sleep wake cycles seen in infancy (polyphasic sleep) through to consolidation of sleep into a single night period (monophasic sleep) is limited. Age at cessation of napping occurs anywhere between age 1 and 5 years but we do not know whether this timing holds significance for long–term behavior, learning and health. Care practices almost certainly influence this timing but we do not understand in what way or to what effect. Understanding the developmental meaning of changing sleep patterns, the association of individual sleep patterns with variation in care environments and the pathway from these to long-term child outcomes are all necessary steps in identifying appropriate care.

Because poverty can be stressful, and indeed depression rates are higher for the impoverished, this intergenerational transfer of the effects of stress might be an important mechanism impeding intergenerational mobility.  In the language of economics, parents provide their children with a type of human capital—which I term ‘affective capital’—through their genetic and epigenetic bequests and through their parenting investments.  The children carry this capital with them into adulthood, where it protects children from anxiety and depression, influencing their educational and labor market choices as well as their own parenting behavior, propagating through multiple generations.",null,"Tuesday, 24 November, 2015","Thursday, 26 November, 2015",Social Science

Similarly, childhood psychopathology has been found to be associated with physical traits including BMI, as well as adversely affecting cognitive traits like IQ and educational attainment (Pine et al., 2001, Singh et al., 2013, Costello and Maughan, 2015). These individuals typically go on to have less favorable outcomes in areas of adult functioning related to health, SES and social relationships/isolation (Copeland et al., 2015, Costello and Maughan, 2015).

   The goal of this project is to carry out large-scale analyses of the genetic overlap between adult psychiatric disorders and related traits, and childhood and adolescent psychiatric phenotypes. To achieve this, this study will use available GWAS summary statistics data on adult psychiatric disorders and related traits to construct polygenic risk scores (PRS), as well as phenotype data on childhood internalizing behaviour, ADHD/Attention Problems and Social Problems from multiple suitable cohorts. Specifically, we will test the ability of the PRS to predict childhood and adolescent psychopathology in a regression model that tests the association between each polygenic score and each trait at different ages, thus allowing us to test for differences in the associations between different PRS and childhood psychopathology across cohorts, outcomes and age.

Summary results will be transferred to the analytical team in Amsterdam who will meta-analyse the ALSPAC data along with several other cohorts from the CAPICE consortium.",,"Tuesday, 9 October, 2018","Tuesday, 9 October, 2018","Genetic epidemiology (including association studies and mendelian randomisation), Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Statistical methods, Genetic epidemiology"

Recent community studies indicate that up to 1 in 6 adolescents have self-harmed at some point in their lives, with the incidence rising rapidly between 10 and 16 years of age. Self-harm is distressing for individuals, their friends, families, and carers, and is associated with a range of poor outcomes in early adulthood. It is also the strongest known risk factor for suicide. Although self-harm is very common in adolescence, we know little about what causes this behaviour. A better understanding of the factors that increase the risk for self-harm, and the mechanisms through which they operate is important in order to develop more effective treatments.

Many previous studies have identified early life adversity (such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect) as an important risk factor for self-harm. However we don’t yet understand how exposure to adversity can trigger later self-harm behaviour. It is known that the social environment can have an impact on internal biological processes. This is of interest as there is growing evidence to suggest that biological factors are involved in suicide and self-harm. We aim to study whether experiences of early adversity are associated with three different biological processes (inflammation, onset of puberty, and DNA methylation) and explore whether these factors are, in turn, associated with self-harm in adolescence. This work can provide a model whereby early adversity can lead to self-harm through biological pathways. This could lead to identification of potential markers of future self-harm risk, as well as possible targets for treatment, and interventions to prevent people from developing self-harm. In order to investigate these pathways, it is necessary to establish the order in which events occur. To do this requires a large sample with information collected at multiple time points from childhood to adolescence. Our research will also investigate whether associations between inflammation, puberty, DNA methylation and self-harm are causal, or whether they might be explained by other factors (known as confounding).

To date, most studies of self-harm in adolescence have been based on small clinical samples – these are highly select groups, already known to medical services. In addition, existing studies have tended to focus only on suicide attempts, but only one quarter of self-harm episodes are carried out with expressed suicidal intent. An important question is whether suicidal and non-suicidal self-harm are distinct behaviours, or part of a continuum of risk. Previous studies have explored whether there are differences in risk-factors and outcomes for these behaviours. We aim to extend this work by providing new information about whether there are differences in their genetic architecture. This work will inform future research studies of self-harm, and help to inform decisions on how self-harm should be defined.",null,"Tuesday, 17 January, 2017","Thursday, 19 January, 2017","Epidemiology, self-harm, Epigenetics, GWAS, Statistical methods, Biological samples -e.g. blood, cell lines, saliva, etc., Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc., Methods - e.g. cross cohort analysis, data mining, mendelian randomisation, etc., Puberty"

At one time it was thought that an anxious temperament was a cause of stuttering, but more recent evidence suggests that anxiety and other mental health difficulties are a result rather than a cause of stuttering; for example, children who stutter often experience negative attitudes and even bullying from other people, and such experiences can lead to mental health problems such as anxiety and poor self-esteem. Few studies have used community samples to look at the association between stuttering and mental health problems. ALSPAC is a particularly appropriate resource for exploring such questions, because unlike other similar studies,  speech and language therapists checked for stuttering when the cohort members were 8 years old. In this study, we will look at whether and how mental health difficulties emerged in children who stuttered at 8 years as they grew into adolescents and adults. Since not all people who grow up with a stutter end up with serious mental health problems, we will also try to identify factors that are associated with positive mental health in people who stutter. We will also gather new data from the cohort members, to find out about stuttering in adulthood and its relationship to mental health. We will ask participants to complete a screen for common mental health problems and a separate measure of social anxiety, which is often elevated in people who stutter.","This work would have potential benefits for people who stutter, their families and third sector organisations that support them, and for professionals who work with them such as speech and language therapists and teachers. The findings could have important implications for the treatment of stuttering and could inform the commissioning of speech and language therapy services.","Wednesday, 2 May, 2018","Tuesday, 8 May, 2018","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Speech/language problem, Statistical methods, Speech analysis, Communication (including non-verbal), Speech and language"

However, children with obesity are not all equally prone to developing these metabolic disorders; research has shown that there is a subset of obese children who have a more âfavourableâ health profile, including good insulin sensitivity and normal blood pressure, glucose regulation and blood lipid levels. This has been termed metabolically healthy obesity (MHO), which contrasts with metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO), where excess body fat is accompanied by metabolic disorders. Since most of the research to date on MHO and MUO has focused on adults, the specific determinants of MHO and MUO in paediatric groups are still not clearly understood.","Childhood obesity is associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease, type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome and premature mortality. Defining the sub-group of overweight/obese children who remain metabolically healthy (and lean children who are metabolically unhealthy) is important as it can aid in understanding which factors protect against the clustering of metabolic alternations in these sub-groups. Specifically, this study should improve our understanding of the health profile, socio-demographic characteristics and dietary patterns that are associated with metabolic health status in overweight/obese and lean children. This will add to the information available when updating public health guidelines and when developing more efficient personalised approaches for interventions and treatment of obese adolescents based on metabolic health status.","Monday, 20 April, 2020","Tuesday, 21 April, 2020","Epidemiology, Obesity, Prospective association analysis, BMI"

It helps to define how cells respond to environmental signals and, ultimately, contributes to health or susceptibility to disease. However, the amount and the effects of differences in DNAm from one person to another is poorly understood. Understanding DNAm variability is a complex area of research as DNAm varies from one type of cell to another and can change over time. In addition, DNAm is influenced by genetic, molecular and environmental and other factors. So far, most epidemiological studies of DNAm have been performed in blood comprising diverse cell types. Furthermore, it is unknown whether DNAm changes lead to other molecular changes (for example gene expression) or whether the reverse is true, with molecular changes leading to changes in DNAm. Together, this makes the interpretation of DNAm variability difficult.","The epigenome may harbor useful information about life-time exposures and disease risk factors. Large mQTL resources will be of use to the scientific community to elucidate mechanisms of genome regulation, to control for genetic confounding in EWAS, to identify causal pathways between molecular factors and disease risk and to elucidate functional effects of GWAS variants.","Monday, 19 October, 2020","Thursday, 22 October, 2020","Epigenomics, Healthy aging, Long read methylome sequencing, Epigenetics"

We are interested in understanding the relationship between copy number variation at loci critical to development, growth and disease. Our current region of interest focuses on a genomic domain spanning genes important for pluripotency, energy utilisation and the immune response. Our analysis of the current genome build reveals part of this region to exist mainly as an ancient (pre-simian) tandem duplication, with corresponding gene duplications. SNP genotyping across this interval in a case control study demonstrated association with rheumatoid arthritis and also revealed hints for CNV (Lorentzen et al, 2007). Due to its complexity and limited LD with surrounding DNA the region is not detected using current genome wide SNP technologies, and therefore targetted CNV analysis is required. Assays for CNV within the tandem duplication were developed based on an adaption to the paralogous ratio test (PRT)(Armour et al, 2007). In these assays the relative number of copies between the tandem repeats is assessed using oligonucleotide primers that amplify simultaneously from both repeats. During this analysis we discovered that either repeat can be duplicated or deleted, thereby representing a complex CNV. From these investigations we have developed an accurate copy number counting assay and demonstrated a significant association between rheumatoid arthritis and copy number of this tandem duplication. This region is of substantial interest as, in addition to the association with RA, it has been implicated in a number of disorders through the data from the rat genome database including QTLs related to insulin resistance and heart disease. Mouse models determine that homozygous nulls for this gene are lethal whereas heterozygous null are related to insulin resistance and increased body mass. Furthermore, changes in protein levels of one of the genes within the CNV in humans has been linked to cancer, insulin resistance and Alzheimer's disease. Given the wide range of disease associations and the role pluripotency, energy transfer and immune response plays in growth and development it is likely that changes in copy number at this region will have an impact on various underlying biochemical measures. Therefore it would be prudent, in addition to traditional case control studies that we are planning, to examine the role of copy number in relation to various endophenotypes. For this the highly characterised ALSPAC cohort is ideal.",null,"Monday, 30 March, 2009","Monday, 30 March, 2009","Genetics, Psychology"

We are interested in two questions. The first question is, how do ânatureâ and ânurtureâ combine to influence childrenâs attainment? To answer this question, we will test whether parental education-associated genetics are associated with the quality of parenting they provide to their children. We will test associations with parental behaviour from before a child is born (e.g., smoking, alcohol use during pregnancy), through infancy (e.g. breastfeeding), childhood (e.g. warm, sensitive parenting; cognitive stimulation), and adolescence (e.g. parental monitoring). We hypothesise that parentsâ education-associated genetics are positively associated with these changing forms of parental investment across time. These analyses are a replication and extension of two previous papers from our lab (Wertz et al., 2018; Wertz et al., in press). In the proposed study, we will extend our previous work by a) analysing parenting across a wider age range of the child; b) replicating prior findings across several datasets (including ALSPAC); and c) incorporating measures of genetics and parenting from both mothers and fathers. The second question is, how do links between family socioeconomic status (SES) and childrenâs educational attainment change across time? To answer this question, we will test if the influence of family SES on childrenâs school performance has remained stable in Britain over time. We will test associations between family SES and childrenâs educational attainment across childhood, and compare estimates across different cohorts -- including ALSPAC -- from different historical periods. We hypothesise that the effect of family SES on childrenâs education will be relatively stable across time. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment.","We believe this research will have impact in at least three ways. First, this research will create a better understanding of how genes and environments work together to shape child development. Second, this research will provide insights about how changing educational systems within the UK affect links between family background and children's attainment. Third, this research will contribute to a better understand of the mechanisms underlying and modifying the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment.","Wednesday, 13 May, 2020","Thursday, 14 May, 2020","Social Science, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Statistical methods, Parenting"

However, not all sedentary behaviors show negative relationship with cognitive functions and most studies focused on leisure time sedentary behaviors. Consequently, these studies were unable to assess the relationship between daily volume of sedentary time and cognitive functions. Physiological adaptations to sedentary lifestyle include adverse cardio-metabolic profiles and low-grade inflammation. These physiological responses contribute to suboptimal brain and cognitive functions. Chronic stress has been negatively related to cognitive functions in youth and adults. Socio-economic status is one of the correlates of sedentary behaviors and higher levels of chronic stress have been observed among individuals with low socio-economic status. Thus, individual differences in chronic stress may help explain the associations between sedentary time, physical inactivity and suboptimal cognitive functioning. Furthermore, it is important to ascertain which biological pathways may be specific to excessive engagement in sedentary time. Adolescence and young adulthood are the most opportune periods to study these relationships due to low prevalence of chronic disease and comorbid conditions compared to middle-aged and older adults, high levels of sedentary time (adolescents are the most sedentary group after older adults, and European adolescents spend on average 7.5 hours per day sedentary) and protracted development of higher order cognitive functions yielding them amenable to behavioral interventions during these developmental periods.","Our work will help elucidate the role of potential biological pathways that may help explain the relationship between objectively measured sedentary time, physical activity and cognitive functions in adolescents and young adults from ALSPAC.","Saturday, 29 August, 2020","Wednesday, 2 September, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Obesity, Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., BMI, Cognition - cognitive function, Physical - activity, fitness, function"

The relationships of childhood growth and body mass index (BMI is used to define obesity) trajectories, that describe how BMI changes as a person ages, with adulthood obesity have been well-documented. However, few studies have investigated whether there are multiple different patterns of BMI change over age that all lead to adulthood obesity but have different health outcomes. For example, it has been proposed that there are two main BMI patterns that lead to adulthood obesity. The first is characterised by being big at all ages due to a healthy combination of fat and fat-free mass, while the second is characterised by low or normal BMI in infancy and subsequently an unhealthy level of fat accumulation in childhood. It is hypothesised that the first pattern doesn't incur any adverse health consequences, while the second pattern does. This project aims to test this idea that there exist multiple different BMI patterns that lead to adulthood obesity and that they have different consequences for cardio-metabolic health. The same analysis in normal weight adults will help explain the BMI pattern that leads to some normal weight adults having poor health prospects.","This will be the first robust study to investigate how different BMI trajectories may explain heterogeneity in cardio-metabolic health prospects among obese adults (and also among normal weight adults).

Half of all lifetime psychiatric disorders present before adulthood, with a point prevalence of between 10% and 20% of children and adolescents experiencing mental health difficulties. In addition, more than 40 percent of youths with a lifetime psychiatric disorder go on to develop at least one additional mental illness concurrently or later in life. This adds significant complexity to diagnosis and interventions and further increases the likelihood of negative outcomes, such as criminality, low educational attainment and unemployment. A developmental perspective that investigates the interrelations between multiple mental health issues from early life up until adulthood is likely to offer important insights into why mental health problems commonly co-occur and can consequently inform prevention strategies. In the current project, using state-of-the art statistical techniques, we propose to analyse the developmental relations of mental health problems. We will further examine potential factors linking mental health problems together such as genetic predispositions to mental health problems, perinatal risk factors, and school problems. The results of this project will have important clinical implications. In particular, they will shed light on potential risk factors that drive the development of co-occurring mental health problems, give insights into which symptoms are likely to precede other symptoms and further help identify other factors that might exacerbate the development of co-occurring mental health problems. Thus, findings will inform early intervention strategies for preventing the development of secondary mental health disorders.","Findings of this research will have important implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of co-occurring mental health problems. First, the project will shed light on different patterns of co-occurring mental health problems as well as underlying risk factors that increase the likelihood of suffering from co-occurring mental health problems. This will inform diagnostic criteria and will help to reduce the prevalence of co-occurring mental health problems through targeted interventions. Second, through examining the direct and indirect links between symptoms of different mental health difficulties and other potential risk factors, results will illuminate mechanisms that underlie the developmental course through which co-occurring disorders develop. This will help to improve targeted early intervention strategies that have the potential to prevent the development of secondary mental health problems. Overall, this project will help reduce the prevalence of mental health issues and improve long-term outcomes for children and adolescences suffering from a mental health disorder. Findings will be disseminated through publications in international peer-reviewed journals and will be presented at national and international conferences.","Thursday, 28 January, 2021","Monday, 1 February, 2021","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Developmental disorders - autism, Mental health, Statistical methods, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Development, Genetic epidemiology"

General mood and mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and particularly, seasonal affective disorder, have been shown to vary with seasonality, weather, latitude and exposure to sunlight(3â7). For instance, in summer mania admissions and suicidal behaviour were reported to be higher(8,9) and depressive episodes less frequent(8). Whilst direct and indirect sunlight was found to influence the sleep cycle, anxiety and depressed mood(4).Biological explanations for this relationship involve neurotransmitter regulation and vitamin D synthesis. Sunlight exposure on the retina stimulates intrinsically sensitive retinal ganglion cells, and as a consequence the secretion of melatonin, which is critical for regulating the sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm). Sunlight also plays a role in the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that elevates mood, whereas bright light affects endocrine and neurophysiological responses in the brain that trigger alertness(4). Additionally, sun exposure is the main source of the hormone vitamin D, which exerts its biological effects throughout the body (at least 36 human tissues have been found to contain vitamin D responsive elements, including the brain)(7). Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with mental disorders and increased depressive symptoms in a range of populations, as well as with poorer cognitive performance(5,10). In an earlier study carried out in ALSPAC children we generated polygenic scores, using polymorphisms in pigmentation genes, that were strongly associated with the participantâs pigmentation characteristics and in turn with their reaction to the sun and use of sun protection(11). In this new study we would like to explore the potential association of similar polygenic scores âas proxies for sun exposure- with mental health problems experienced by ALSPAC now young adults and their mothers.",null,"Monday, 29 January, 2018","Wednesday, 31 January, 2018","Epidemiology, Mental health, Genetic epidemiology analysis, Mendelian randomization, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution, Genetic epidemiology, Mendelian randomisation, mental health, pigmentation, sunlight"

It is characterised by poor lung function (airway narrowing), that is difficult to improve and is viewed as a disease of older smokers. However recent research reveals that several factors may influence lung function developmental patterns (trajectories) from early life towards COPD.

In our Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (IOWBC) at 26-years we showed that young adult asthmatics at 26-years experienced poorer adolescent lung growth, young adult smokers had faster declining lung function in adulthood while asthmatic smokers showed worst lung function suggesting particular risk for early COPD. Indeed several lung function trajectories are now described which might be associated with COPD. Confirmation of such associations is needed and best achieved using research cohorts studied across the lifetime.

We will identify lung function trajectories using measurements in the IOWBC to age 32-33 and a sample of 1500 subjects in ALSPAC-30 with the goal of identifying early evidence of COPD and what drives that. We will further characterise IOWBC participants using more detailed lung function tests, imaging (CT scans), and samples obtained directly from their airways using techniques called induced sputum and bronchoscopy to identify COPD features. They will also provide blood samples to assess relevance of gene/environment interactions to COPD-risk (epigenetics). We will test these IOWBC COPD-risk findings on a proportion of ALSPAC-30 subjects who will also undergo further lung function tests and imaging to see how generalisable they are to other populations. We will use existing ALSPAC-30 epigenome characterisation to further corroborate IOWBC findings.",This research has potential to significantly enhance understanding of how COPD develops and what might be done to reduce the impact of that disease. Early identification of COPD through the findings of this research could have a significant impact on individual patient management by focusing early interventions including medication and lifestyle changes. That can have significant impact on the burden of COPD at a wider societal level in due course and mitigate the financial and resource burden of that high morbidity disease state in later life. Awareness of what predisposes declining lung function in early adulthood could also lead to meaningful interventions to prevent that process and associated COPD-risk.,"Wednesday, 30 October, 2019","Thursday, 31 October, 2019","Clinical research/clinical practice, Lung Function Trajectories

MIH affected teeth appear discoloured, and vary in presentation; cream, yellow or brown. Teeth are commonly very sensitive, painful and in severe cases crumbly. Furthermore, affected teeth often have a poor prognosis and are more susceptible to dental decay meaning the teeth are often extracted before adulthood. It is usually diagnosed when the adult molars and incisors erupt in the mouth at around 6-7 years of age. In some cases, it can also affect the primary teeth, which is known as hypominersalised second primary molars (HSPM) and is seen around 2-3 years of age.","Our results should help to improve our understanding on whether maternal smoking, alcohol consumption and BMI have an effect on MIH. This may help to provide accurate and non-stigmatised public health advice about maternal exposures and the dental health of children. As MIH affected teeth have been reported to have very poor prognosis and accounts for a significant proportion of childhood decay, diagnosing and intervening as early as possible can affect outcomes significantly.

Thus, this research program will aim to (1) using a large birth cohort, extend the existing models to incorporate all periods across the developmental period with a focus on the translational aspects of BMI and obesity risk, (2) cross-validate the model in another large, separate birth cohort (of which data is already obtained) and (3) compare the performance of the new model with pre-existing cross-sectional growth curves to predict BMI and adiposity changes from DXA.

Almost every chronic disease shows this same ‘gradient’ with our social and economic circumstances (the jobs we do, the places we live etc.). Given the wide range of conditions that vary with our social and economic circumstances, it has been proposed that there are some common biological pathways in how these experiences can ‘get under the skin’. This project will look at the relationship between childhood socioeconomic circumstances (based on parental characteristics) and a biological risk score known as allostatic load. Allostatic load comprises a number of biological measures taken from blood samples that aims to measure how our bodies are functioning prior to disease. The aim is to examine how allostatic load varies by socioeconomic circumstances in children aged 9 from the ALSPAC study. Very little evidence exists about the development of allostatic load in childhood and its association with socioeconomic features, although there is good evidence for social patterning in adolescence (greater deprivation being associated with poorer/unhealthier allostatic load scores). This work is particularly important as childhood is a critical period in the development of our bodies and our risk of disease later in life.

This rising prevalence of obesity is not only due to single genetic or environmental factors, but largely attributed to complex gene-environment interactions. Genetically predisposed individuals may be more prone to obesity in an obesogenic environment. Previous studies have focused on the identification of specific environmental factors that interact with genetic predisposition to obesity. The results indicate that physical activity, diet, age, gender and ethnicity could modulate the risk for obesity. Socioeconomic position (SEP) is relevant to all realms of behaviors and lifestyles, is a key factor that determines health across the lifespan, and may carry over to subsequent generations. The fact that BMI inequalities have persisted across different generations means that SEP is a significant factor to consider when understanding the role of environment. Parental SEP could influence the offspringâs risk of obesity through shared lifestyles such as dietary profile, home environment, social networks, and physical activity patterns early in life, which may be exacerbated by predisposition to obesity. Emerging studies have started to focus on SEP mobility across the life course, or intergenerational SEP mobility across two generations. The findings show evidence that higher parental education may be favorable in lowering obesity risk in offspring, especially for women. Longitudinal research should minimize reverse causation and allow us to investigate the dynamic interplay between oneâs social strata of origin and own achieved social strata on obesity. However, it is still unclear how early the ancestorsâ influence emerge and to what extent susceptibility to obesity is attenuated by SEP mobility.

We hypothesize that higher grandparental SEP, and upward SEP mobility across generations would diminish the grandchildrenâs risk of obesity, compared to those who are always in social disadvantaged strata. The approach to consider ancestorsâ SEP as a modifier in the heritability of BMI will add in tailoring appropriate interventions in future work.","A better understanding of the etiology of obesity and the related risk factors will help to identify possible preventative strategies. Parental SEP has immediate and long-term effects on children’s health. More evidence suggests that we need to move the emphasis from traditional risk factors to ‘upstream’ factors. In particular, this applies to the socioeconomic determinants of health. Minimizing social inequities through effective policy would offer an important opportunity to prevent the development of risk factors and consequent disease. The development and implementation of obesity prevention strategies could target factors contributing to obesity in social disadvantage groups. To conclude, the results from the study will add new evidence to the national and international research in this area.","Monday, 2 December, 2019","Tuesday, 3 December, 2019","Epidemiology, Obesity, Statistical methods, BMI"

It has been suggested that this increase is controlled by the timing of puberty and, in particular, the onset of menarche; girls who experience puberty earlier may be more likely to experience more depressive symptoms compared to girls who experience it later. Although this link is seen in girls in their mid-teens, it is not clear if this association continues into later teenage years and later on, into adulthood. It is possible that girls who experience late menarche have a decreased risk of depressive symptoms into adulthood and therefore this late menarche may serve as a protective effect. However, girls who experience late menarche may show a 'catch-up' effect and eventually have similar levels of depressive symptoms compared to girls who have an earlier onset of menarche. There is a lack of research investigating the onset of menarche on depressive symptoms beyond teenage years, into adulthood. It is therefore important to investigate whether onset of menarche and the timing puberty explains some of the depressive symptoms seen in adult women. This would also aid in the understanding of the mechanism behind the link between puberty and depression including psychosocial and, hormone and neurological theories.","The findings from this research will building on the evidence and understanding of how pubertal timing affects depression in adolescent girls. This could allow the identification of more at-risk groups of depressive symptoms and therefore inform the development of programmes, particularly in schools, to target these at-risk groups and reduce the risk of depression in young girls.","Friday, 11 October, 2019","Friday, 11 October, 2019","Epidemiology, Mental health, Statistical methods, Puberty"

Measurements of central adiposity such as waist circumference or waist:hip circumference are said to be better predictors of adverse metabolic outcomes and more direct measurements of total or regional fat mass (such as obtained by DXA, MRI or CT scanning) are thought to better predict adverse outcomes than BMI. However, simple measurements of height and weight (that are used to derive BMI) are more feasible to complete in clinical and public health practice than methods that involve radiological examination, and BMI assessment is also likely to be easier and more reliable than measuring waist and hip circumference in clinical or public health practice. It is also possible that the best measure of adiposity (with respect to predicting adverse outcomes) differs by age and gender. To our knowledge very few studies have directly compared the magnitudes of association of BMI with other measurements of adiposity/fat distribution to determine the extent to which BMI may underestimate true associations with adverse outcomes. Several studies in adults have compared BMI and waist or waist to hip circumference but these have rarely made appropriate direct comparisons of standardised measurements. They have tended to include both measurements in multivariable models and conclude that the one remaining statistically significant is the better measurement. To our knowledge no study has attempted to make such comparisons across a range of cohorts of different ages. The aim of this project is to compare the magnitudes of association of different measurements of adiposity/fat distribution with metabolic and vascular outcomes and all-cause mortality (outcomes will vary and be appropriate to the cohort) in cohorts of different ages.

The medical consequences of these genetic changes are however still very poorly understood. Particularly, we don't really know how these changes lead to increased risk of combinations of physical and mental health problems over time. As presence of a physical or mental health problem increases risk of other ones developing, it is important to understand how and why this happens in this high-risk group. Because these genetic changes are rare, it is important to bring together large samples to study their role in medical outcomes properly. This is particularly important if we want to understand how these changes influence the combined risk of physical and mental health problems in different groups within the population, for example young people versus adults, different ethnic groups and groups from different socio-economic backgrounds. To study these important questions, we propose to work together across four large UK studies in which these genetic changes have been established and which have collected rich information on physical and mental health as well as relevant risk factors. The data sets we will work with differ in the age and ethnic and socio-economic background of the participants. We will be able to follow over time how risk of physical and mental health problems influence each other and how this may be different in these different age. ethnic and socioeconomic groups. The findings will have important implications for developing better interventions for this group, for understanding complex medical risks in the population more generally and for insights into the biology of complex medical risks.","The impact will be large, as very little is yet known about the medical implication of pathogenic CNVs in the general population.

To this end, we will develop a novel technique for clustering DNA methylation (DNAm) sites which will aid reducing the complexity of the subsequent EWAS. For example, a DNAm site that is hypo-methylated in the smoker cohort but hyper-methylated in non-smoker one merits further analysis for significant association with smoking, while those sites exhibiting no difference in the two cohorts does not.

We will investigate the use of algorithms for large matrix factorisation under constraints to provide a natural clustering of DNAm sites, and study what statistical guarantee is achievable under which conditions. To verify the suitability of the proposed method, we propose to use the DNA methylation data available from ARIES.","The findings from the proposed study will help lay a solid foundation for addressing the additional challenges brought on by epigenetic data analysis include (i) handling of continuous exposures beyond discrete variables (e.g., smoker/non-smoker), and (ii) accounting for cell heterogeneity. In particular, further research into (ii) is highly relevant since samples are measured at bulk rather than at the single-cell level and the methylome obtained for each sample contains the signals aggregated from distinct cell types. Few existing methods can identify the risk-DNAm sites for each individual cell type, missing the opportunity to obtain finer-scale results in EWAS.

Based on neurocognitive measures of impulsivity, we have found that nonpsychotic adolescent first-degree biological relatives of SZ patients (FDR) are more impulsive than adolescents with no SZ family history. Our study further indicates that structural and functional abnormalities in prefrontal brain regions confer increased impulsivity in FDR. These findings have led us to postulate that abnormalities in frontal-striatal interactions that mediate reward processing may underlie increased impulsivity among individuals at-risk for SZ. This ALSPAC proposal will extend our research by studying adolescent impulsivity in individuals before they are diagnosed with SZ. This project is significant because it has high potential to advance current understanding regarding SZ susceptibility. It will lead to new knowledge regarding the role of prefontal brain circuits during adolescence in mediating reward processing and impulsive behaviors prior to the clinical manifestations of SZ.","If pre-schizophrenics from the ALSPAC cohort were already more impulsive during adolescence than non-schizophrenics, it will greatly strengthen our finding of heightened impulsivity in adolescent first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients. The implications of these findings include: 1) frontal-striatal brain circuits are impaired during adolescence among individuals at-risk for developing schizophrenia, 2) dysfunctional cortical-striatal interactions may be an underlying basis for increased impulsivity during adolescence, and 3) difficulties in using reward information to modulate cognitive control may leads to impaired motivational drive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

For certain complex traits however, it may be the case that there is difficulty in phenotypic measurement and this can lead to issues of statistical power. This is particularly problematic for behavioural phenotypes that may be predominantly determined by the environment, as is the case for educational attainment and well-being (Okbay et al., 2016; Okbay et al., 2016; Rietveld et al., 2013). Genetic analyses of such phenotypes can be hindered by the fact that individual SNPs have limited explanatory power and any associations found may not be causal or may be mediated by many other intermediate phenotypes (Krapohl et al., 2014). However, such studies have enabled the description of common genetic contributions to complex behaviours. Taken together, these GWAS results form a pool of genetic variants which may then be used in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses; both looking at the effect of these features on outcomes but also the effect of outcomes on them.",,"Wednesday, 4 April, 2018",null,Genetic epidemiology (including association studies and mendelian randomisation)

Existing methods for predicting adult stature in youth are generally limited in their accuracy and reliability and/or based on older and non-British samples. As such, their reliability and validity have been questioned. Being able to predict adult stature allows researchers and practitioners to express the child's current height as a percentage of their predicted adult stature. These percentage values provide an index of somatic maturation that can be used to describe the degree to which a child is advanced, on time, or delayed in maturation relative to their age and sex. Such values are increasingly being used as indicators of maturation status in both research and practice. As noted, however, the reliability and validity of the method for predicting adult stature has been questioned. Working with colleagues at the Institute for Mathematical Innovation at Bath University we hope to utilise the ALSPAC dataset to develop more accurate methods for predicting adult stature in British youth. If successful, we would be more than happy to allow for these methods to be included as part of the ALSPAC data set.

This will be achieved by identifying maternal and fetal genetic and gene x environmental determinants of toxic elements in fetal cord blood and using this information to undertake Mendelian randomization (MR) studies.

To date, the pathways underlying these relationships remain unclear. It has been proposed that exposure to ACEs may affect the development of the hypothalamicâpituitaryâadrenal (HPA)-axis and lead to related vulnerability to stress-related mental health problems over the life course. Interestingly, despite the high prevalence of ACEs, some individuals do not develop stress-related dysfunctions. By better understanding the underlying mechanisms by which children exposed to adversities show later resilience, there may be opportunities to learn more about ways of intervening and preventing adverse outcomes. Overall this project aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the biopsychosocial pathways through which exposure to ACEs may affect the development of the HPA-axis, and resilience or vulnerability to stress-related psychopathology (depression/anxiety) over the life course, considering complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors.","Academic Impact: This research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the aetiology of stress-related mental disorders. Additionally, it will bring about important methodological innovations owing to the use of advanced statistical methods to measure adversity clusters and the integration of sophisticated assessments of biological and genetic factors.
Clinical impact: The results of this project will also have the potential to inform clinical interventions for the prevention, detection and treatment of ACEs and mental illness. These may include: psychosocial interventions to manage the negative effects of childhood adversity and reduce stress levels; pharmacological therapies to ameliorate psychiatric symptoms; and genetic testing to identify individuals at higher risk early in development and tailor treatment plans.
Policy impact: Such understanding of the life course pathways linking early-life stress with mental health will advance the existing evidence base, providing policymakers with reliable and extensive data with which a more streamlined process of policy development might be better manoeuvred. This may see an increase in funding for mental health and social care trusts, improved intervention programmes in schools, and lead to an improvement in the services available for children and families","Thursday, 10 January, 2019","Tuesday, 15 January, 2019","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Developmental disorders - autism, Mental health, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Gene mapping, GWAS, Statistical methods, Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Birth outcomes, Hormones - cortisol, IGF, thyroid, Immunity, Mothers - maternal age, menopause, obstetrics, Offspring, Parenting, Social science, Statistical methods, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Development, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution, Epigenetics, Genetic epidemiology, Genetics, Genome wide association study"

Depression and anxiety during pregnancy have been largely neglected despite evidence suggesting symptoms of these disorders are higher during pregnancy than the postnatal period (Evans et al., 2001; Heron et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2007; Ross, Evans, Sellers, & Romach, 2003). Furthermore, research in this area indicates that antenatal depression and anxiety increase the likelihood of postnatal mental health problems (Heron et al., 2004), and are associated with negative offspring outcomes in childhood (Deave, Heron, Evans, & Edmond, 2008; O'Connor, Heron, Glover, & the ALSPAC Study Team, 2002; O'Connor, Heron, Golding, Beveridge, & Glover, 2002; O'Connor, Heron, Golding, Gover, & the ALPAC Study Team, 2003). While existing research highlights the need for increased attention to anxiety and depression experienced during pregnancy, important questions remain.

Adversities have been robustly linked to psychiatric and other medical conditions where the consequences can persist far into adulthood. It is not well understood how early adverse experiences are biologically embedded and what processes might be set into effect that would sustain long term health risks. To address these key questions we performed a prospective, longitudinal methylome-wide association study (MWAS) of childhood adversity where data on adverse experiences was linked to methylation data on almost all 28 million common methylation sites in blood. Specifically, we used samples from the Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS). The GSMS started at Duke University about 25 years ago when participants were 9- to 13-year-old and continues today as the participants are in their 30s. The methylome was assayed using and optimized lab protocol for methyl-CG binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq).

	Results showed that childhood adversity has a substantial impact on the methylome. These effects tended to increase with the number of adverse events and were predictive of future health outcomes. For example, using k-fold cross validation to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effects size, lifetime cumulative adversity exposure shared over 20% of its variation with the methylome. This adversity associated methylation variation in childhood (14.2 years of age) was a better predictor of depression symptoms in adulthood (25.8 years of age) then childhood depression symptoms themselves and this contribution remained significant after regressing out the cumulative adversity exposure count. Cell type specific MWAS suggested that most of the methylation changes involved the granulocyte cell subpopulation.

As a next step we propose to replicate findings in samples from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents (ALSPAC). The ALSPAC study is critical for this purpose as, similar to GSMS, samples are available before and after adversity and where adversity induced changes can be linked to an array of health outcomes later in life. Furthermore, as ALSPAC is also a prospective, longitudinal it allows us to create a cumulative (life time) measure of exposure to adversity. As the vast majority of our top findings are not assayed by Illumina methylation array that cover only 450,000 sites (~2% of all common methylation sites in blood), we propose a targeted replication study using a protocol for amplicon sequencing of bisulfite converted DNA that we have already optimized and tested.

Successful completion of this project implies that we gained insight into how childhood adversities alters the methylome and what changes persist over time. We will also have identified processes associated with health risks in childhood/adulthood and found replicable methylation biomarkers associated with these risks. Methylation markers are stable and can be measured cost-effectively in blood, which is relatively easy to collect. Our findings therefore also have translational potential as, for example, diagnostic âbiomarkers of health riskâ.","Impact is likely very high.

Several studies have shown that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are related to higher risk of overweight and obesity not only in adults (Felitti, 1998; Barry, 2008; D’Argenio, 2009; Fuller-Thomson, 2013; Shin, 2011), but also in children and adolescents (Lumeng, 2013; Slopen, 2014). However, this evidence comes mostly from high-income countries, and socioeconomic position is known to be an important predictor of both ACEs and overweight. Cross-cohort comparisons allow exploration of relationships in settings with different confounding structures and, therefore, if the association is consistent across these, it is less likely to be driven by residual confounding (Brion, 2011).

Furthermore, the majority of existing studies that assess the relationship between ACEs and overweight use body mass index (BMI) as a measure of adiposity, which does not directly assess fat quantity or body fat distribution (Wells, 2006). Thus, a more accurate quantification of overweight by using body composition assessment is important to better determine future risk of diseases (Ayvaz, 2011).

Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the relationship between ACEs and adiposity in adolescents, using data from two birth cohorts from different socioeconomic backgrounds.",null,"Tuesday, 15 December, 2015","Thursday, 17 December, 2015","Epidemiology, Obesity, Statistical methods, BMI, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Methods - e.g. cross cohort analysis, data mining, mendelian randomisation, etc."

If this response remains active for too long, however, it may cause changes within the blood and arteries that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Some teenagers and young adults already show signs of these changes, but why this happens isnât fully understood. As inflammation is known to be a response to infection, one explanation may be that it occurs in some people because they are more frequently exposed to illnesses/infections than others. Another explanation, however, may be that lifestyle choices that some people make (eating a poor diet, not exercising, becoming obese, etc) affect the âgood bacteriaâ that live within the gut, and that this triggers an inflammatory response from the body to try to protect itself. We aim to test whether bacterial-driven inflammation can cause changes in the blood and arteries that are often observed in people of this age. We also aim to test whether a newly discovered molecule (GlycA) is associated with these changes, and if having a high level of GlycA can therefore predict who is more likely to have cardiovascular problems 6-7 years in the future.","As recent evidence has suggested a cumulative impact of CV risk factors across the lifespan (with both the magnitude and duration of exposure contributing to the risk of future complications), an understanding of the pathways underlying early disease progression and the identification of age-specific biomarkers to accurately stratify risk is essential in order to guide lifetime management of CV risk and reduce the population burden of disease.

A large body of research supports the influence of the prenatal environment on childrenâs developmental and mental health outcomes. For example, prenatal depression has been linked to later risk of depression in children, and prenatal depression, prenatal anxiety, and stressful life events during pregnancy have all been associated with risk of anxiety disorders in children. There is also growing interest in understanding the potential biological causes that may drive these relationships. In particular, inflammation has been suggested as a potential factor that may influence these associations, due to its role in the onset of depression and other mental and physical health disorders. However, few studies to date have examined the role of inflammation in relationships between prenatal maternal stress and child and adolescent mental health outcomes, calling for continued research in this area.","We anticipate the publication of 3 papers in peer-reviewed journals as a result of this project – results will also form part of a doctoral thesis. Additional dissemination strategies will involve presentation of findings at national and international conferences, and communication of findings through social and news media. The proposed research will have potential implications for both practice and policy. Understanding the role of parenting and maternal coping resources in relationships between prenatal maternal stress and offspring immune and mental health outcomes can inform and promote interventions that may lessen the burden of poor mental and physical health in children.","Monday, 13 July, 2020","Tuesday, 14 July, 2020","Epidemiology, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Statistical methods, Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Development, Immunity, Offspring, Parenting"

This perception contrasts starkly with the knowledge that there are hundreds of potential resources that can supply data and samples. The work of the Tissue Directory and Coordination Centre and backed by the Medicines Discovery Catapult has shown that the actual problem experienced by both academic and commercial researchers is the inability to find suitable resources. The consequence is that researchers tend to utilise the resources that are close by proximity (because they can go and talk to the resource directly) rather than close to their research goals. This approach is driven because there is no easy mechanism in which to discover other potential national resources.

The Tissue Directory and Coordination Centre (TDCC) is the UKs national centre that is tasked with coordinating biobanks (samples and data) to ensure that researchers re-use existing resources before seeking to collect new samples or datasets. TDCC is a joint endeavour between the University of Nottingham and University College London. TDCC has created a Tissue Directory to allow a high-level search on aggregated meta data that works well for clinical and disease orientated biobanks. In part the Tissue Directory has begun to solve the issue of findability but the challenge has evolved. Researchers can search on very high-level classification of disease, gender and age and resources matching those criteria are displayed. This Directory acts as a first filter but does not allow researchers to ask detailed feasibility questions. Although candidate resources are listed the confidence that the data or samples required do actually exist remain low once sub-typing is considered. Assuming the identified resources have a search portal (many do not), the researcher would have to create accounts in each in order to perform a more detailed search. This effort can often go unrewarded as the ultimate answer is often that once more detailed criteria are added, the resource does not have the data or samples required.",,"Monday, 29 April, 2019","Tuesday, 30 April, 2019",Data Discovery at scale

Academic: The principal beneficiaries of this research will be academics who are working in the field of lung development
during childhood. There will be opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaborations through the EC COST Action:
Developmental Origins of Chronic Lung Disease and we are working on collaborations across the life course, for example,
with the ECRHS study to investigate comparative influence of genetic and lifestyle factors on lung function. ALSPAC is a
member of several large-scale consortia working on genetic underpinnings of lung function, COPD and asthma, which will
benefit from the additional data generated by this research. Data will be shared more widely through the existing ALSPAC
data management and dissemination policy.

Patients and Public: Increased recognition and understanding of the childhood origins of obstructive lung diseases will
benefit patients, their representative organisation, practitioners and the general public understanding of health and disease.

Policy Makers: Identification of factors in childhood that can influence life course lung development and resulting adult lung
function has policy implications for early recognition of high risk populations, healthcare advice and public health policy to
control exposure to adverse factors where possible.

Industry: Increased emphasis on early life factors with demonstrable long term influences on lung function potentially opens
pathways to modification of current treatment strategies and new therapeutic targets. Linkage to a large repository of
biological data has the potential to discover biomarkers of disease phenotypes that could be amenable to personalised
approaches to treatment.

How will they benefit?
Scientific advancement: This proposal will generate new knowledge through understanding some of the important early life
influences on the development of lung function. It will also provide the scientific community with data that can be applied to
other research questions concerning the genetic and environmental influences on lung function acquisition. This will
stimulate further research to identify pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning these associations, contributing to UK
scientific capital.

Increased understanding and awareness: Patients and Practitioners will benefit from recognition that early life factors are
important contributors to the development of obstructive lung diseases in adults. Clinicians will have evidence-based
knowledge on which to advise patients about risk factors and interventions, including lifestyle changes. Public
understanding about early life risk factors for COPD may shift their attitudes to research in this area, benefiting charitable
organisations by increasing available research funding.

This work is important to in order to identify interventions to reduce the risk of poor lung health, COPD and associated mortality.","Thursday, 10 October, 2019","Thursday, 10 October, 2019","Epidemiology, Respiratory - asthma, COPD, lung health and development, Ageing, Development, COPD, Asthma, lung development, lung health"

Victoria has one of the highest number of reported maltreatment cases in Australia (2), with girls aged 13-15 particularly vulnerable. For maltreated girls who go on to become mothers in adulthood, preliminary data show that their children have negative health outcomes in the form of physical attributes like low birth weight; even after accounting for parental socio-economic factors (3).

To a large extent this is due to treatments being given too late in the disease, when people have established memory impairments. As such there is a major need to identify LOAD in its very earliest stages, many years prior to symptom onset at midlife. The aim of this study is to meet this need by detecting changes within the enthorinal cortex (EC)-hippocampal-fornix circuit, representing the first brain regions affected by LOAD.

To do so, this study will investigate people at genetic risk of LOAD in midlife. It is well known that people with the ApoE4 gene are at higher risk of LOAD but more recent genome-wide association studies have now shown other genes whose collective risk for LOAD can be quantified as polygenetic risk score (PRS). This study will therefore test the hypothesis that the EC-hippocampus-fornix circuit is disrupted in people at risk of LOAD (ApoE4 positive and high PRS). Circuit structure will be investigated using high gradient MRI to measure tissue properties of the hippocampus and its connections (notably the fornix) focusing on pathway size, density and insulation (myelin sheaths). Circuit function will be tested in the form of spatial navigation and memory, respectively evaluating the EC, hippocampus and fornix function.

If successful, we will both aid diagnosis of presymptomatic LOAD and provide a means of stratifying at-risk individuals for future treatment trials aimed at prevent the onset of LOAD.","This study may lead to the identification of the earliest warning signs for risk of LOAD in midlife in brain structures known to show the earliest neuropathology of LOAD. The study will provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms. For instance if we found genetic risk related selective degeneration of myelin sensitive MRI metrics in late myelinating regions e.g. in the fornix without any evidence of grey matter changes in the hippocampus then this would suggest that white matter/myelin damage may precede neuronal death in grey matter regions. Such evidence would provide the rational for developing therapeutics that slow down myelin breakage (e.g. DHA, anti-inflammatories).","Wednesday, 18 January, 2017","Wednesday, 25 January, 2017","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Cognitive impairment, Late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), dementias, GWAS, Medical imaging, NMR, Statistical methods, Cognitive assessment; high gradient diffusion MRI and tractography, Ageing, Biological samples -e.g. blood, cell lines, saliva, etc., Cognition - cognitive function, Equipment - MRI, Intelligence - memory"

Hypothesis 1: Women who are single/divorced will experience the menopause at an earlier age than women who are married/in a relationship.

Hypothesis 2: Sexually active women will experience a later menopause than their counterparts who do not have sex/have sex less frequently.

Hypothesis 3: Sports participation during adolescence is contingent upon female breast size/development.

	For the first two hypotheses, maternal age of menopause will serve as the dependent variable, with marital status and sexual activity acting separate predictors. Control variables will include: socioeconomic status, whether a smoker or not (and frequency of such), BMI, reason for period stopping, age of first and last birth, amount of children, inter-birth interval, contraceptive use, HRT use, ethnicity, age of respondent, and age of first period. The purpose of this study is to assess the causation associated with marital status/sexual activity and age of menopause. While previous studies have found an association between being single/divorced and an earlier age of menopause, it is unclear whether people are single because they had the menopause earlier, or whether the menopause occurred earlier as a result of their marital status. If the latter is found, we will attempt to use evolutionary theory to explain the phenomenon, with a similar principle being applied to level of sexual activity.

	The third hypothesis will investigate whether females with larger breasts participate in sports less frequently. Once again, we will analyse the results from within an evolutionary framework, utilising the mismatch hypothesis. Should women with larger breasts participate in sports less, then it may be that there is a trade-off between reproductive success and physical health; for, while larger breasts are positive for reproductive purposes, they may be hindering in regards to exercise and physical fitness. Here, sports participation serves as the dependent variable, with breast development being used as a predictor. Control variables include ethnicity, BMI, maternal socioeconomic status, gynoid lean and fat mass, smoking status, age at completion, and timing of first period.

interaction. Children with emotional and behavioural problems are more likely to have a history of poor

social cognition ability. However, the path from poor social cognition to emotional and behavioural problems

in childhood and adolescence is unclear. The possibility I will explore in this PhD project is that social

cognitive deficits increase stress (i.e., hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation and flattened cortisol

rhythm and/or chronic inflammation), leading to emotional and behavioural problems. Cortisol and

inflammatory cytokines are thought to be promising biomarkers of various stressed-related behavioural and,

particularly, emotional disorders, yet existing evidence in children and adolescents is little and mixed, and

is mostly about clinical disorders. Additionally, it is not known yet how cortisol and inflammatory cytokines

work when facing stress caused by social cognition deficits, especially in the general population. The aim

of the project is to explore the role of these biomarkers in the interplay mechanism of social cognition deficits

and emotional and behavioural problems in children and adolescents, using longitudinal data from a large

general population study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Analytically, the project will

explore three relationships: a) the longitudinal association between deficits in core aspects of social

cognition (emotion recognition & theory of mind) and emotional and behavioural problems, b) the role of

cortisol in explaining the association and c) and the role of inflammatory cytokines in explaining the

association. The relationship between inflammation and cortisol is complex so the final analysis exploring

the role of both will consider this complexity fully.","Academic and policy. We think our findings will be of use and value to the following 4 groups. The first group are those making decisions about preventive and early treatment interventions. A second group to whom results will be addressed are the general public, especially parents and expectant parents.

MC4R is the most common single gene disorder responsible for obesity and although estimates of its frequency in the population have been made, we don’t know exactly how common it is. We also don’t know exactly what the chances of a person carrying one bad copy of the MC4R gene has of becoming obese or when during their life this would start to be noticeable.

Psychotic illnesses affect just under 1% of people in England. Symptoms include hearing voices and experiencing confusing and distressing thoughts. These often begin in early adulthood, and can have a major effect on peopleâs lives.

People with psychotic illnesses seem to have more eyesight problems. We are not sure why, but it might be because:

â¢	Possibility 1: Some people with psychotic illnesses find it harder to look after their health including their eyes, for example by going to the opticianâs.

â¢	Possibility 2: The same brain changes cause eyesight problems and psychotic illnesses.

â¢	Possibility 3: Eyesight problems increase a personâs chances of having a psychotic illnesses.

I plan to look at which of these best explains the link between eyesight problems and psychosis. If people with psychosis have less eye care (possibility 1), we need to improve this. If possibility 2 is correct, eye research might hold the key to understanding more about the brain changes that cause psychosis. Or, if eyesight problems lead to psychosis, then improving eye health could be a way of preventing or reducing psychosis.

I will start by reviewing past research, to make sure I base my work on the most up-to-date information.  I will then carry out research using two large datasets: UK Biobank and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).

UK Biobank has information on over half a million 40 to 69-year-olds including questionnaires, eyesight tests and genetic tests.

ALSPAC has information on 14,500 UK families. The children have been followed up since before birth and will be 25.

I will look at UK Biobank and ALSPAC because older and younger people are most at risk of developing psychosis. In these datasets, I will see if people with short-sight genes have more psychotic illnesses. If so, this would be evidence that poor eyesight can lead to psychosis. Genes are present before birth, so I will know that they came before any psychotic illness began. I will also find out if genes for psychotic illnesses are linked with eyesight problems. This would suggest the reverse: that psychosis leads to poor eyesight.

I will also use a third, Israeli dataset. All Israeli 17-year-olds have health checks to decide if they can join the armed forces. I will use this data to find out if teenagers with eyesight problems are more likely to have a psychotic illness over the following years. If so, I will see what level of eyesight problems are associated with developing psychosis. This will allow me to test the theory that perfect eyesight and complete blindness both protect against psychosis, with moderate eyesight problems carrying the highest risk.

Throughout this research, I will chair a group every 6 months. It will include people with psychosis, people with eyesight problems, carers, charity members and doctors. We will discuss study findings and think about how to use them to improve the experiences of people with eyesight problems and psychosis. This will include plans to publicise findings, influence healthcare and plan new studies.

When the research is finished, I will tell healthcare professionals and researchers about the results at meetings and in journals. I will also write about them in publications read by people with mental health and eyesight problems. I will offer to present findings to public groups, through links with the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) and a forum of mental health service users.

People with eyesight problems and mental health service users helped to write this summary.","I will aim to publish findings in peer-reviewed journals. An implementation group will meet six-monthly, with particular emphasis on pathways to impact.  They will advise on opportunities to disseminate findings via healthcare professionals, charities, and patient and carer groups, and develop plans to influence clinical practice, for example by responding to NICE and other relevant consultations.

Visual impairment can be debilitating and is preventable in around 50% of cases. If we demonstrate evidence that psychosis increase risk of visual impairment (hypothesis 1), this would represent a major unmet need in people with psychosis; a health inequality that could and ought to be addressed. This may be different between younger people, who are most likely to experience a first episode of ‘non-organic’ psychosis associated with neurodevelopment, and older people, who are at higher risk of having psychotic symptoms associated with neurodegeneration. Older people are also more likely to have non-myopia causes of visual impairment than younger people.

Studying the ophthalmic changes that lead to visual deterioration in psychosis could provide insights into the neurological processes underlying some psychotic illnesses, potentially informing the development of new treatments. It has been proposed, based on this hypothesis, that retinal nerve fibre layer thickness could be used as a diagnostic test for schizophrenia.

If we demonstrate evidence supporting hypothesis 3, offering eye tests to people at high risk of or in the early stages of a psychotic illness could be a rational intervention to test. Training in visual processing has also been suggested as a possible therapeutic intervention for people with psychotic illnesses and visual impairment based on the hypothesis that visual impairment may contribute to its development.","Wednesday, 12 August, 2020","Tuesday, 25 August, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health"

According to that study, factors which increased risk for cardiovascular disease in SMI patients included antipsychotic use and higher body mass index (BMI).

However, the interplay between SMI and CVD and their risk factors is complex. Reverse causation or confounding might compromise our ability to draw causal conclusions and in fact, no study to date has addressed the causal effects between SMI and CVD or the potentially mediating role of factors such as BMI.

The observed association between SMI and CVD also points towards shared biological correlates. Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, can present a potential biological mechanism linking SMI and CVD. DNA methylation signatures have been robustly linked to SMI and SMI / CVD risk factors (Barker, Walton, & Cecil, n.d.; Dick et al., 2014; Joubert et al., 2016; Kato et al., 2015), but no study to date has investigated the epigenetic overlap between CVD and SMI.",null,"Wednesday, 20 September, 2017","Wednesday, 20 September, 2017","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, cardiovascular, Epigenetics, GWAS, Metabolomics, Cardiovascular, Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc., mental health"

The majority of studies examining this intergeneration 'transmission' of sexual abuse and violence have been conducted using samples from populations in which there are a high number of victims and outside the UK. Furthermore, studies have tended to focus on the sexual abuse histories of the mother and not the father. This study, using a general population sample (i.e., of people not specifically identified on the basis of being victims of sexual abuse) will enable us to identify the extent to which mothers' sexual abuse experiences increase the risk of similar victimisation in their children. We will also examine the impact of the sexual histories of fathers and what other factors (e.g., other types of abuse experienced by the mother and/or father, parents' mental health, children's early development and conduct disorders) exacerbate or reduce the risk of intergeneration transmission.","This research is important to understand in a general UK population study whether the child of parents who have been sexually abuse are at a greater risk of being victims of sexual abuse than children whose parents have not been abused. It will also highlight whether it is the sexual victimisation specifically or other factors that co-occur that increase the risk. This will have important implications for the prevention of sexual abuse, particularly in respect of identifying areas that can be the focus of intervention and support for parents who have experienced sexual abuse, in order that the risk to their children is minimised. If the findings show that the children of sexually abused parents are not at increased risk (i.e., due to the nature of the sample in this study compared to the specific sexual abuse population samples in most other studies), then the findings have significant impact for theory/policy developed on the belief of intergenerational transmission.","Saturday, 18 May, 2019","Monday, 20 May, 2019","Social Science, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Statistical methods, Child sexual abuse

Full blood counts tap into a small but medically important subset of this information such as the relative proportions of several types of white blood cells in a blood sample: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Their relative proportions often reflect what is going on the body. For example, high neutrophil counts may indicate a bacterial infection and high eosinophil counts an allergic response. Patterns of methylated and unmethylated cytosines in genomic DNA extracted from white blood cells provide another source of information in a blood sample. These patterns can not only differentiate between cells of different types but also between individuals with different specific phenotypes such as age and BMI and exposure histories such as smoking behaviour. Some phenotypes and exposures have such distinct patterns that the patterns can be used as proxies for the original phenotype or exposure. Proxies for cell counts are the easiest to develop because methylation patterns differ dramatically between cell types. These cell type specific patterns include so much of the genome that they often obscure patterns linked to other phenotypes and exposures. Fortunately in some cases the pattern is only partially obscured and can be rescued by including cell count information in mathematical models.

With this map of variation in methylation across the life course, we can then identify those eras that show most variability as these may highlight critical windows for healthy development or disease vulnerability.",null,"Wednesday, 6 September, 2017","Wednesday, 6 September, 2017","Developmental biology, Epigenetics, Ageing, Biological samples -e.g. blood, cell lines, saliva, etc., Development, Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc., Methods - e.g. cross cohort analysis, data mining, mendelian randomisation, etc."

Although common in adults, T2D was previously rare in childhood, but its prevalence in this age group has been increasing in the past two decades as a result of the childhood obesity pandemic, accounting for up to 45% of cases of diabetes in youth in certain at-risk populations. The prevalence of prediabetes (an early stage of T2D, which is characterized by elevated blood sugar below the threshold to diagnose T2D) is even higher among obese children. Furthermore, individuals who develop both prediabetes and T2D in childhood and adolescence develop early microvascular complications, whose treatment failure is high. Thus, prevention of young-onset T2D using targeted lifestyle modification presents a particularly important yet difficult challenge. As such, identifying children at increased risk early in their lives is critical for these targeted interventions. Additionally, quantifying the genetic liability to youth-onset T2D could help better understand the respective contributions of environment vs genetics in the etiology of this disease. For instance, it is crucial to understand if among children with increased genetic risk for T2D, a favorable environment can prevent the development of T2D.

T2D  has a polygenic nature, with an important heritable component explaining  between 20% and 80% of the risk to develop this disease. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been demonstrated to have an improving ability to identify adult individuals at significantly high/low predisposition towards polygenic diseases. Therefore, it has become possible to identify adults who will lie at the extreme distribution of a trait, such as risk of T2D. T2D is causally linked to obesity. Obesity, as expressed by the measures of body mass index (BMI), is also a highly heritable polygenic trait. A PRS for adult BMI (Khera et al, Cell 2019) has been able to predict differences in body weight in ALSPAC children as early as at birth, with increasing predictive performance as individuals grow older.

Therefore, we posit that, similar to the PRS for BMI, a PRS for adult T2D, in combination with clinical risk factors (such as nutrition and physical activity) may be able to effectively predict individuals presenting abnormal glycemic traits  in childhood. Since T2D and prediabetes in both adults and children is causally linked to obesity, we will also test if a PRS for adult BMI predicts abnormal glycemic traits in children. We will then compare the predictive performance of the PRSes and combine them with traditional non-genetic risk factors to enhance T2D risk prediction in youth. Finally, among children at the extremities of the PRS distribution (ie children with the highest and lowest genetic risk  for T2D), we will seek to identify which environmental factors mitigate the effects of this genetic risk, and either contribute or prevent the development of T2D. To do this, we will use a large pediatric cohort representing the general population (ALSPAC), as well as a population of children at risk of obesity (QUALITY), both of predominantly European ancestry.","Our study can potentially stratify for risk of T2D among children, based on PRS derivable at no risk and low cost. Such a stratification is likely to improve screening for candidates for targeted lifestyle interventions,  while optimizing allocation of medical resources. Individuals who maintain normal glycemic profile despite an unfavorable PRS – or develop T2D despite a favorable PRS – may be of particular interest, since the discordance between polygenic susceptibility and clinical phenotype in these individuals could result from a disproportionate influence of environment. As such, this study can lead to interesting conclusions on the “nature vs nurture” of T2D in youth. Finally, a clear understanding of the genetic predisposition to obesity may help to destigmatize obesity among patients, their health care providers, and the general public.","Monday, 22 February, 2021","Tuesday, 23 February, 2021","Genetic epidemiology (including association studies and mendelian randomisation), Diabetes, GWAS, Genetic epidemiology"

Multiple theories hypothesize developmental differences in children's reactions to interparental conflict, but few studies have investigated these differences within a prospective longitudinal design. The purpose of the proposed study is to examine in detail the impact that the timing and chronicity of exposure to interparental conflict has on children's later adjustment difficulties. The effect of these factors will be investigated prospectively in a community sample of more than 6,000 families with varying degrees of interparental conflict and adjustment difficulties. We made three main hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that interparental conflict will positively predict subsequent child adjustment. Second, based on theoretical and empirical support, we hypothesize that children exposed to parent conflict earlier in their development will have worse emotional and behavioral outcomes when compared to children exposed to conflict at later age points. Finally, we predict that children exposed to chronic elevated levels of interparental conflict over the early and middle years of their development will show increased levels of subsequent adjustment problems. In addition, children's gender, nonverbal receptive skill, and locus of control will be examined as potential moderators of the parent conflict-child adjustment association. The results of this study may serve as a step toward a better understanding of how timing and chronicity of exposure to parent conflict impact the relationship between parent conflict and children's adjustment problems.",null,"Monday, 14 December, 2009","Monday, 14 December, 2009","ADHD, Behavioural Problems, Parenting"

However, genetics and individual eating habits have also been argued to heavily influence weight. Eating more than needed can lead to weight gain, but for some, exercising control and knowing when to stop is particularly difficult. Longitudinal studies have suggested that flexible restraint (e.g. a gradual approach to dieting, using control when over-eating) is more adaptive and prevents weight gain in individuals with a lack of control over eating relative to more rigid forms of restraint (an âall or nothingâ approach). This study proposes to investigate how much of the relationship between inherited genes and obesity in adulthood, is facilitated by eating habits and food preferences, and whether these pathways can be lessened through contending eating behaviours and food preferences in childhood and adulthood.","Understanding of the mechanisms through which genetic determinants affect eating behaviours, and in turn adiposity is expected to inform the body of research investigating the most effective obesity prevention and treatment interventions.","Tuesday, 26 May, 2020","Tuesday, 26 May, 2020","Psychology and Genetics, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Obesity, Computer simulations/modelling/algorithms, Statistical methods, BMI, Cognition - cognitive function, Genetic epidemiology, Genetics, Growth, Neurology, Nutrition - breast feeding, diet, Psychology - personality"

One possible mechanism is DNA methylation, where a methyl-group is added to a DNA molecule. Also common variation in the DNA itself can influence DNA methylation. In this project we aim to assess the impact of common DNA variation, prenatal environment, and their combined effects on DNA methylation in newborns.","Our results support that a more complete picture of factors influencing DNA methylation should include genotype information and could also help to detect environmental influences that may only be unmasked in the context of a specific genetic background. This highlights the importance of including both individual genetic differences as well as environmental phenotypes into epigenetic studies and also the importance of improving our ability to identify environmental associations. Our data also support the disease relevance of variants predicting DNA methylation together with the environment beyond main meQTL effects, and the view that there are functional differences of additive and interactive effects of genes and environment on DNA methylation. Improved understanding of these functional differences may also yield novel insights into pathophysiological mechanisms of common non-communicable diseases, as risk for all of these disorders is driven by both genetic and environmental factors.","Monday, 19 November, 2018","Tuesday, 20 November, 2018","Genetics, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Statistical methods, Birth outcomes, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Development, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution, Epigenetics, Genetics, Mothers - maternal age, menopause, obstetrics, Offspring, Statistical methods"

This trait is moderately stable across the childhood to adulthood  [1].  Shy children often express social withdrawal and internalizing problems (i.e., loneliness, anxiety and depressive symptoms), if they have experienced negative peer experiences, such as peer rejection and victimization [2-6].  In contrast, mutual and high-quality friendships [6, 7] as well as parenting styles characterized by high warmth and autonomy [4, 8-10] buffer against social withdrawal and internalizing problems among shy youth. While the link between shyness and later socioemotional problems is well-documented, little is known about physical health outcomes of shy children even though epidemiologic studies suggest that childhood social withdrawal/isolation, an outcome of childhood shyness, is an independent risk factor for increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in adulthood [11-13].  Similarly, studies using animal models show that rodents and dogs with stable neophobic/inhibited traits have shorter lifespan, dampened immune response, and elevated glucocorticoid production [14-17]. Yet, no studies in humans have identified whether early temperamental shyness plays a role in increased CVD risk in adulthood and how temperamental shyness, peer and parental relationships shape the development of physiological systems linked to CVD risk across the lifespan to confer later health risks.  This research proposal aims to address these knowledge gaps by considering a broad range of negative and positive peer-experiences in relation to CV risk factors measured from childhood to adulthood, and the potential role of child mental health within this relationship.

A population cohort study.,"Attention deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disabling neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of the population. There is emerging evidence that early detection and intervention improves neurodevelopmental disorders outcomes.  This knowledge, coupled with clear evidence that the first signs and symptoms of developmental disorders may be evident for many children by 30 months of age, has led to increased early detection efforts. However, it is still uncertain how best to identify the very first signs of these disorders. For example, early speech, motor delay or global developmental delay, birth and neonatal complications may index future neurodevelopmental disorders. Investigations using prospective designs may be especially fruitful because they are less affected by retrospective recall biases.

In this project I propose to utilise data from a large, prospective population-based cohort, ALSPAC. The aim is to test the hypothesis that early developmental difficulties in the first year of life precede ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders emergence by ages 7 to 9 years.

This work will represent a step towards earlier detection of ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders prior to the onset of behavioural symptoms.","The findings of this study may bring more clarity towards a long-held suspicion that early differences underscore the multifaceted nature of ADHD. We aim to identify genetic risk factors of ADHD, as well as precursors and early signs reported in the first 3 years of life among children from general population that later develop ADHD. The findings of this study may have potential implications for the development of approaches to early population screening and intervention programmes. Early predictors of ASD have been broadly researched, but in comparison, this has not been extensively studied in ADHD. We therefore highlight the need of considering the developmental determinants of ADHD, as well as the genetic and environmental factors.","Wednesday, 5 August, 2020","Friday, 7 August, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Developmental disorders - autism, Statistical methods, Genetics"

It often occurs in the absence of obvious injury. It can be very difficult to treat. The UK is home to several large databases that contain information about subjectsâ life history of pain and their genetic âmake-upâ. We plan to use the largest of these (UK Biobank) to help identify the genes that are related to the presence of a chronic pain condition (e.g. pain of duration >3 months) and the related symptoms experienced by sufferers e.g. low mood, poor sleep, lack of motivation, (pain) anxiety or pain depression. By gaining confidence that these genetic markers are related to the presence of a chronic pain condition, we will then use this information to recruit two small (each <200) groups of ALSPAC subjects who may or may not already have a pain condition. The beauty of this approach, is that by identifying the genes that make people susceptible to developing a pain condition, we will see how this interacts with health factors e.g. weight, blood pressure, and events that shape a personâs psychology e.g. adverse life events such as bereavement, to try to provide a means for people to modify their risk, or identify people for whom early intervention might be most beneficial following an injury â to hopefully avoid them going on to suffer life-long pain.","1.

Conduct Disorder is often regarded as the precursor to Antisocial Personality Disorder later in life, and is also associated with delinquency and other problematic behaviour which negatively affect the individual as well as the social environment. Recent studies showed that among patients with Conduct Disorder a subgroup with ""limited prosocial emotions"" exists, characterized by more callous-unemotional personality traits. Our research project focuses on the question whether this LPE (limited prosocial emotions) specifier indeed represents a clinically meaningful and distinct subgroup. Whether a subtype to a diagnosis is a meaningful classification can be assessed by finding out whether individuals endorsing the specifier show e.g. a different symptomatology, different prognosis, differing therapeutical outcome, different neuroanatomic and biological correlates, and other differential socioeconomic patterns. Hence, the project aims at finding out more on whether the LPE specifier is a useful behavioural and neurobiological marker to the diagnosis of Conduct Disorder. In a previous project (European Collaborative Study FemNAT-CD) we collected evidence on behavioural and neuroanatomic correlates of the LPE-specifier. We would like to use ALSPAC in order to replicate our findings in another sample and make use of the longitudinal quality of ALSPAC.","We hope that we can provide additional evidence on whether Limited Prosocial Emotions (LPE) are a clinically relevant subtype for Conduct Disorder.

A pedigree is a special type of graph in that nodes representing individuals can only have two parents and parents must be labelled as being of opposite sex. Consequently, general graph learning algorithms are not very efficient unless they are suitably modified, although we do not have the additional problem encountered in other applications of having to learn the probabilities on the edges (arrows) between nodes as these derive from our knowledge of the genetic model under consideration. James has been in communication with us for some time and has considered a number of approaches to this specialised graph learning problem.

Some patients with CD may be asymptomatic, others present with non-specific symptoms, making the diagnosis difficult. Only 30% are thought to be diagnosed. Treatment for CD is lifetime adherence to a gluten free diet. Untreated CD may lead to malnutrition, anaemia, osteoporosis, infertility in women, lymphoma and small bowel cancer. Guidelines recommend that adults and children “at high risk” of CD should be offered testing. However, it is not clear which groups are at sufficiently high risk to justify routine testing.

We have performed a systematic review to identify symptoms and risk factors related to CD. We will use ALSPAC data from children who were tested for CD to determine which combination of symptoms and risk factors best predict CD diagnosis. The results from this study may help GPs decide who should be offered testing for CD.","Appropriate identification and treatment of CD can have significant benefits for patients in terms of symptoms, quality of life, and long-term health outcomes, as well as reducing healthcare and societal economic costs.","Thursday, 17 December, 2020","Thursday, 17 December, 2020","Epidemiology, Coeliac disease, Computer simulations/modelling/algorithms, Statistical methods, Coeliac disease"

However, sexual activity can also lead to adverse health consequences including sexually transmitted infections (STI) and unintended pregnancies, whose impact may be profound and long lasting. Intimate relations may also be the setting for violence between partners with wider health consequences for families. In the UK and elsewhere the above adverse outcomes are common and may be increasing, in part reflecting deficiencies in intervention policies. The UK Government has specified improving sexual health as an overarching priority. Sexual behaviour associated with increased risk of adverse sexual health outcomes may be influenced by the dynamic interplay of biological, individual, social, cultural, environmental and political processes across the life course. In particular, sexual development takes place in the context of developing social, peer and romantic relationships. It follows that an understanding of the development of young adult sexuality and other risk-taking behaviours and the association between these behaviours and outcomes such as STI requires longitudinal data about early and middle childhood experiences, as well as accurate data about the onset of romantic, sexual, and risk-taking behaviour from late childhood onwards. Such understanding is key to the design of appropriate public health interventions to improve sexual health. If the causal roots of risky sexual behaviour and its adverse sexual health consequences lie early in the life course then this is where effective intervention should be targeted. However, it may be that risk of adverse sexual health outcomes is substantially determined by proximal factors essentially independent of the pathways that precede them. This possibility has different implications for prevention. It may also be the case that most risk of adverse sexual health outcomes is not primarily attributable to a definable syndrome of risky sexual behaviour. Finally it is important to investigate the predictors of positive sexual health outcomes as these may also have implications for effective health promotion.",null,"Tuesday, 1 April, 2014","Thursday, 3 April, 2014",

Interestingly, we have recently shown that individuals who are genetically predisposed to lower activity of the inflammatory response (i.e. CRP levels and blockade of IL-6 cell signalling) have higher risk of schizophrenia5. This, seemingly contradictive, finding may be explained by a genetically determined decreased inflammatory response resulting in an increased susceptibility to early life infection4.

Given that a successful pregnancy outcome is highly dependent on the establishment and maintenance of an adequate placental circulation, it is possible that abnormalities of placental vasculature, leading to inadequate fetomaternal circulation, may be responsible for at least some poor pregnancy outcomes. This has led to an interest in the thrombophilias as risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome. The factor V Leiden mutation is the most common form of inherited thrombophilia.1 A point mutation in the factor V gene at nucleotide position 1691, resulting in an arginine to glutamine substitution, reduces the sensitivity of the factor V protein to inactivation by activated protein C (activated protein C resistance) resulting in a pro-coagulant state and an increased risk of thrombosis.2 The trait is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with the risk of thrombosis increased seven times in heterozygotes and 80 times in homozygotes. 3 Studies have shown that the distribution of the factor V Leiden mutation varies in different populations, being present in about 5% of Caucasian individuals (Europeans, Jews, Arabs and Indians) and virtually absent in Africans and Asians.",null,"Monday, 1 March, 2004","Monday, 1 March, 2004","Genetics, Obstetrics, Pregnancy"

Despite their high prevalence and adverse effects, research into the causes, prevention and treatment of continence problems is scarce. Clinicians recognise that psychological factors are strongly associated with continence problems but research is needed to examine whether these factors actually cause continence problems.

The proposed research will use cutting edge statistical methods to examine whether there are causal effects of psychological factors on continence problems in childhood, adolescence and adulthood. The psychological factors we will examine include depression, anxiety, emotional and behaviour problems, stressful life events, maternal mental health, parenting, and childhood adversity. We will investigate whether characteristics relating to the child (e.g. toilet anxiety), parents and wider influences (e.g. peers, school) may help to explain the association between psychological factors and continence problems. We will also examine the role of inflammation as a biological process that might underlie the link between psychological factors and continence problems.

If we find evidence that psychological factors cause continence problems, this could help clinicians to develop more effective interventions and treatments. Ultimately, our research could improve the lives of people affected by continence problems and help the NHS make better use of its resources.","Children, young people and adults with bladder/bowel problems, and parents/carers of children with bladder and bowel problems will benefit through raising the profile of these common and distressing health problems. A greater understanding of psychological factors in the aetiology of bladder/bowel problems could help to ensure appropriate psychological support is offered. An increased understanding of the origins of bladder/bowel problems and potentially modifiable factors in childhood could prevent these problems from becoming chronic and avert secondary impacts on quality of life.

Clinicians in paediatric and adult continence services (urologists, nephrologists, pediatricians, psychiatrists, GPs, nurses, health visitors, urotherapists, gastroenterologists, colo-rectal specialists, uro-gynaecologists) will benefit from our contribution to the evidence base relating to the effect of psychological factors on bladder/bowel problems. Clinicians have long suspected that psychological factors are involved in bladder/bowel problems, but the exact nature of the relationship is unknown. If psychological factors do have causal effects on bladder and bowel problems, this could inform intervention development.

Our contribution to the evidence base will also benefit stakeholders involved in designing paediatric and adult continence services and care pathways (Department of Health, NHS, NICE, ChiMat, policy makers, commissioners). Psychological interventions could help to relieve the persistence and treatment resistance that often characterise bladder/bowel problems, and this could ultimately help the NHS make better use of its resources.

Researchers (epidemiologists, clinical academics, psychologists, statisticians) will benefit through signficant advances in understanding of the effects of psychological factors on bladder/bowel problems and the application of causal inference methods. The statistician employed on the project will develop research skills that will be invaluable in his career development.

Our research has the potential to contribute to the PLUS consortium's overall goal of improving prevention and intervention strategies for LUTS in females.

This will help these organisiations achieve their aim of providing support for and improving quality of life for children, young people and adults with bladder and bowel problems.

What underpins the pervasive and situational manifestations is not well understood, and the impact of pervasive and situational dysfunction on future outcome (such as mental health, occupation, and educational status) needs further investigation. Different underlying mechanisms may relate in specific ways to the degree to which ADHD is expressed pervasively or situationally in the school or home setting.

Health policy and interventions in high income countries, such as the UK, have reduced rates of smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy; however, the prevalence of these harmful behaviours in low and middle income countries is rising. We are interested in investigating these health behaviours in Uruguay, where more than a quarter of women smoke throughout pregnancy and nearly half of women use alcohol in pregnancy. Intervening with smoking and alcohol use in pregnancy in Uruguay presents a significant opportunity for reducing these health behaviours in the long-term and for disease prevention. Yet policy on smoking/alcohol and pregnancy in Uruguay is limited and findings from surveys suggest that both the health care system and health professionals in Uruguay have not sufficiently prioritised reducing smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy. Efforts to implement further policy changes have been impeded by insufficient national evidence concerning the harms and economic consequences of these health behaviours. We aim to analyse existing data from national surveys in Uruguay to establish evidence, within the national context, for the relationship between pregnant women’s smoking and alcohol use and the harms to themselves and their infants. Given the existing evidence from countries such as the UK, and, in order to inform health policy in Uruguay, we aim to compare the evidence for these health effects in Uruguay with effects observed in the UK.  We hypothesise that the harmful effects of smoking and alcohol in pregnancy in Uruguay will be more pronounced than in the UK; this is because in Uruguay a poorer health care system and high levels of other risk factors (e.g., poor diet, substance misuse) might exacerbate the effects relative to a developed country. We aim to do this using UK data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). This study is a collaboration between academic groups in the UK and Uruguay, and The Lullaby Trust, a charity concerned with maternal smoking and use of alcohol as they can lead to sudden infant death. We anticipate that findings from this study will help policy makers and practitioners in Uruguay better understand smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy and its impact on the mother’s and infant’s health.

Key to the ultimate development of fully effective preventive and management strategies for high blood pressure, both at an individual and population level, will be a comprehensive understanding of the relevant biological pathways. Studies of environmental and genetic risk factors can inform this understanding, and current approaches recognise the importance of both. Recognised environmental determinants of BP include obesity, salt intake and excessive alcohol consumption. Familial aggregation of BP has long been recognised, and estimates of the heritability of systolic and diastolic BP have exceeded 50%. The identification of genes involved in BP regulation, by improving knowledge of the relevant biology, should facilitate advances in treatment and control of BP. The study designs employed in such studies need to account for the fact that BP is a complex trait.

This transition may also come with significant negative health and psychosocial consequences, however. Because early puberty has been linked to an array of health-related issues, factors that predict pubertal development differences among adolescents has been the focus of considerable research. One family factor that has been reliably linked to pubertal development, particularly girls' age at menarche (AAM), is father absence. Whether father absence causes differences in AAM is currently being debated by researchers. On one hand, some research suggests that father absence is an environmental influence that causally regulates AAM. On the other hand, some research suggests that the association is due to genetics: Genetic factors that might dispose a father to be absent are passed down to their daughters, which may dispose them to earlier AAM. This research is limited, however, in that both perspectives take a genes versus (or plus) environment approach, which overlooks how genes and environments operate together. The purpose of this proposal is to examine gene-environment interactions and epigenetic mechanisms of the relation between father absence, pubertal development, and related risky sexual behaviors in adolescent boys and girls.","This research has the potential to help elucidate how early environmental experiences in and around the family influence pubertal development. Discovering how social experiences become biologically imbedded has far reaching implications for intervention, both behavioral and pharmacological.

It is well known that the genes commonly mutated in adult AML (e.g. DNMT3A, TET2) are very rarely mutated in pediatric AML, suggesting that not only is the prevalence of clonal mutation different as a function of age, but also the genetic targets of clonal mutation. Such knowledge is critical as efforts to develop and implement precision therapeutics for a host of hematological diseases continue to expand. The background mutational profile is essential. This study would be the first to systematically examine the mutational spectrum using a high-resolution sequencing method with a limit of detection of 0.0001 in age-appropriate genes recurrently associated with AML in healthy children and young adults. Several studies in the past that utilized low-throughput methods found somatic mutations in genes such as JAK2 and TP53 in individuals without hematologic disease. Individuals with these mutations are associated with an increased risk of developing hematological and cardiovascular diseases in later in life.

Once the background clonal hematopoiesis in healthy individuals is established and characterized, such profile can be used as a comparison point to hematological disease of genetic nature. For example, in some clinical cases involving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), low frequency somatic mutations are present in healthy donors, which seemed to be under neutral selection in the donor’s body, but were subsequently implicated in the onset of secondary leukemia (with a reported incidence of 0.001) in the recipient as a result of clonal expansion, suggesting positive selection for putative pre-leukemic clones. Establishing the prevalence and the mutational spectrum of clonal hematopoiesis of blood and marrow donors would be crucial to understanding the clonal dynamics and selection of many rare donor clones in recipients post-HCT. 

In the subsequent follow-up study, we would identify somatic mutations that could be linked to the development of secondary hematologic complications (e.g. myelodysplasia, donor-derived leukemia, graft vs host disease) in recipients post-HCT, and with such data, we aim to better inform transplantation therapy in order to minimize the risk of secondary hematologic complications in the recipients.","Thursday, 15 February, 2018","Thursday, 1 March, 2018","Genetics, Cancer, DNA sequencing, Genomics"

It explains an estimated 70% of the chronic disease burden. As most of the aspects of our environment are modifiable, this provides a huge potential for disease prevention. Derived from the term exposure, the Exposome is the sum of all non-genetic drivers of health and diseases. Interacting with the genome, it defines individual health at different stages throughout the life course, inlcuding foetal life. The Exposome can be considered from two complementary angles: the External Exposome, comprising aspects of the built environment, the social environment, the physico-chemical environment, and the lifestyle/food environment; and the Internal Exposome, all exogenous or endogenous (bio)chemical entities measured in human biospecimens and influenced by the external urban exposome, including biomarkers of the exposures in the environment that are taken up, metabolised and might lead to biological changes.

EXPANSE will take the next step in Exposome research by introducing the following key elements into its research programme: bringing together large health datasets (millions of individuals) in support of sufficiently sized Exposome studies, addressing the evolution of both the exposome and health over the life-course, moving from observing static associations towards developing dynamic interventions, and introducing methodological innovations and practical tools.

The physical benefits of folic acid supplementation are well documented in the literature; the most notable is protection against first occurrence and reoccurrence of neural tube defects (3), which affects over 900 pregnancies per year in the UK (4). Supplementation has also been shown to reduce the risk of congenital heart defects (5), cleft palette (6). Premature delivery (7) and low infant birth weight (7).

   In terms of neurocognitive development, deficiency in maternal folate levels has been shown to negatively impact on the child’s cognitive performance (8), whereas optimal levels positively impact on language and motor development at age four (9) and lower the risk of children Internalising and externalising problems (10;11).

However, these studies have typically only examined a few sleep parameters (e.g. Dionne et al., 2011; Knowland et al., in press;), with some mixed findings emerging (Kocevska et al., 2017; Touchette et al., 2007). Moreover, research exploring the effects on later mental wellbeing have generally relied on a composite  ‘sleep problems’ variable (reflecting various individual sleep parameters; e.g. frequent wakings, early wakings, nightmares; e.g. Gregory & O’Connor, 2002), making it difficult to conclude which sleep parameters are important. Further research is therefore needed to systematically examine the effects of early sleep on these critical cognitive and wellbeing outcomes. Nevertheless, based on existing evidence, it appears that sleep quality and quantity parameters can predict key outcomes during childhood and adolescence.","This work will have important theoretical implications by delineating the extent to which early sleep predicts performance on meaningful assessments of school readiness and academic achievement. It will provide further insights into the effects of early sleep on later language skills, cognitive abilities, and mental wellbeing. The work may also be important practically, potentially identifying a novel way in which educational outcomes and mental wellbeing can be enhanced during childhood and adolescence. Furthermore, by investigating whether the effects of early sleep are particularly pronounced in children from disadvantaged backgrounds, this project might identify a novel way in which the socioeconomic status gap in educational performance could be reduced.","Saturday, 12 December, 2020","Tuesday, 15 December, 2020","Social Science, Cognitive impairment, mental health - e.g. anxiety, depression, psychosis, etc, speech/language problems, Statistical methods, •	Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity

It has been hypothesized that these increases are a consequence of changing environmental and/or lifestyle factors. Given the multifactorial aspect of these diseases, it is thus important to take into account the interrelations between these factors and respiratory health. The interrelations between body mass/body composition, physical activity, diet and lung function in childhood and adulthood have been incompletely addressed, likely because their time-dependent and bidirectional nature represent a methodologically challenging research question. Marginal structural models (MSMs) allow estimation of causal effects in observational studies by addressing time-dependent confounding (Robins JM et al. Epidemiology 2000). This approach has still limited application in respiratory epidemiology. We aim to investigate the joint and independent causal effects of body mass/body composition, physical activity and diet on lung function during childhood and early adulthood using MSMs in children from the ALSPAC study.","Respiratory diseases are global public health concerns, and leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children and adults. This research project could thus lead to potential public health interventions such as dietary, physical activity or weight loss interventions to improve lung function, prevent lung function decline etc. As per the methodological aspect of this project, we will assess the relevance of using novel methods from the causal inference framework to investigate research questions for which standard epidemiological methods are usually used and/or where knowledge is still needed.

There is some research suggesting that our diet, (what we eat) might make us more likely to become depressed and anxious. This type of research is called 'Nutritional Psychiatry' research. Many research studies have shown that people with depression and anxiety disorders do not have enough of certain 'micronutrients' either in their food, or in their blood. One example is magnesium, which is contained within green leafy vegetables, and is lacking in processed foods. It is possible that our society is not consuming enough magnesium, which could be increasing the number of people with depression and anxiety. However, it is difficult to say whether a low magnesium in depressed people was the cause of their depression. It may be because people with depression eat less healthily, or because people with other problems (alcohol use or long term illnesses) are more likely to get depressed.","A causative association between magnesium and depression/ anxiety would have potential public health implications, as well as provide evidence for the development of non-pharmacological interventions","Monday, 14 May, 2018",null,"Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Statistical methods, Nutrition - breast feeding, diet"

It is also believed that parents are gatekeepers and function as important role model for the development of offspring health behaviours such as diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleeping. Diets has been considered as one of most important health behaviours that offspring adapt from parents throughout development stages of life including early childhood and adolescent period. In the life course epidemiology, diets has been considered as one of most important modifiable risk factors for the development of cardio-metabolic diseases.  Most previous studies on the resemblance of parent-offspring dietary patterns were based on small sample and cross-sectional design. There is no study that considered (1) parent-offspring resemblance from early life to adulthood using repeated measures of parent-offspring diets; (2) whether this resemblance was influenced by other life style factors such as physical activity, sedentary behaviours, and sleeping (3) pathways of the resemblance of dietary trajectories predict the progression of offspring cardio-metabolic risks. Finally, (4) whether the genetic predisposition factors in parent-offspring dietary resemblance also contribute to the development of cardio-metabolic risk.","The knowledge to be generated from this study will inform the health policymaker and practitioner- how parent-offspring dietary resemblance over the life course plays key role in the development of diseases.

We will be using an approach called Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to gather data about people's alcohol consumption as they go about their normal lives. Specifically, we will be using a new version of EMA called microEMA, which is designed to minimise the level of interuption and burden to people, whilst allowing us to capture detailed data about their drinking behaviours. We have developed a microEMA application to run on a normal, commercially available smartwatch, and will use this, alongside a more traditional questionnaire, to capture information about the type and quantity of alcoholic drinks consumed during each day, and if these drinks are consumed at home or outside the home, and in the company of others or alone. We will do this over a period of 3 months. Because we will ask people about their drinking behaviours throughout the day, we hope to capture more accurate and detailed information about their drinking behaviour with our smartwatch microEMA application than with traditional questionnaires, which people complete days afterwards, and which are known to suffer from problems related to remembering what was consumed, and other reporting biases. We can then use these data to explore differences in drinking behaviours between different groups. We will explore differences in drinking behaviour between high and low social economic position groups. This will allow us to understand, not just the differences in drinking behaviours between the two groups, but if there are differences in the way the two groups use and experience the new smartwatch-based microEMA approach, if this if different to the way they use and experience more traditional questionnaire approaches, and if new approaches like micro EMA might introduce other unexpected biases that could affect the data they collect.","1) To demonstrate the feasibility of using new wearable devices for the capture of high temporal density, longitudinal health data.

Increases in physical activity are often associated with positive mental health outcomes, though more is not always better. For example, up to 40% of individuals with bulimia nervosa and up to 60% of those with anorexia nervosa present with driven exercise (exercising in a driven manner to control weight and shape). Driven exercise is a serious, concerning, and understudied eating disorder symptom. Existing research points towards compulsivity and general propensity to exercise as potential risk factors for driven exercise. At present, our understanding of the developmental etiology of driven exercise is poor, and the extent to which this symptom relates to patterns of PA during development is unknown.

We will examine risk for driven exercise in the ALSPAC cohort by identifying trajectories of physical activity during development and identifying whether these trajectories associate with driven exercise and eating disorder diagnoses in adolescence and emerging adulthood. We will then investigate the developmental timing and predictive strength of driven exercise in relation to eating disorder onset and maintenance. Finally, we will evaluate the degree to which genetic risk profiles inform risk for driven exercise.","At present, we know relatively little about the etiology of driven exercise, its relationship to premorbid activity levels, or how to manage this symptom in the context of ED treatment and recovery. In addition, we do not understand factors that contribute to the substantial variability in physical activity among those with EDs, and why only a portion of individuals present with the symptom of driven exercise. Given the critical need to improve early identification of and treatment for individuals with eating disorders, and even more-so for those who engage in driven exercise, enhancing our understanding of the risk for and development of driven exercise is paramount. Identifying associations between driven exercise, physical activity patterns, eating disorder onset, and the genetic architecture of driven exercise could point towards relevant biological mechanism(s), aid in early identification of at-risk youths, and ultimately inform therapeutic activity recommendations during eating disorder recovery. Further, this research will offer a blueprint for studying other presentations of physical activity dysregulation present in developmental psychopathology (e.g. hyperactivity, restlessness), and clarifying the degree to which various activity symptoms arise from shared versus unique risk.","Sunday, 1 September, 2019","Monday, 2 September, 2019","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Eating disorders - anorexia, bulimia, Mental health, Statistical methods, BMI, Genetic epidemiology, Psychology - personality, Physical - activity, fitness, function"

However, a lack of consensus remains today as to the nature of the relationship between the lateralization degree and cognitive development. Some theoretical positions consider that cognitive deficits are noted in individuals whose laterality is weakly established, in other words ambidextrous, while others consider ambilaterality as an advantage both in terms of language and visuospatial abilities (Boles & Barth , 2011; Chiarello, Welcome, Halderman, & Leonard, 2009; Johnston, Nicholls, Shah, & Shields, 2009). Innovatively, we suggest that this lack of consensus could be attributed to the existence of two distinct causes of ambidexterity with different developmental consequences.","The development of knowledge in this field constitutes a major societal issue, given the evocation in the scientific literature of the frequent belonging of ""laterality disorders"" to the clinical picture of many developmental and learning disorders in children (Kershner, 2019; Penolazzi, Spironelli, Vio & Angrilli, 2006; Xu, 2014), disorders that are most often diagnosed too late, during the first school learning, without allowing us to have a precise perception of the nature of these laterality disorders.
This issue is all the more important given that these laterality disorders affect a large part of the population in vulnerable situations, since they are not only associated with disturbances in oral and written language (including developmental dyslexia, to which we are concerned, which concerns 6 to 15% of school-age children, dysgraphia, dysorthography, dysphasia and language delay), but also intellectual deficit, psychoses (e.g. schizophrenia), neuro-developmental disorders such as autism (affecting 1 in 150 people in France, according to the High Autority of Health, 2017), epilepsy, as well as deviant behavior.
These laterality disorders could even appear as an interesting way of research in the determination of the etiological factors of the Coordination Acquisition Disorders (CAD) or Developmental Coordination Disorders (DCD), also called developmental dyspraxia (Gérard and al., 2005), resulting in early impairment of postural control (static and dynamic balance disorders), coordination and motor learning (lack of tonic regulation, slowness, imprecision, difficulties in relation with novelty, writing impairment), whose co-occurrence with specific language and reading disorders is noted in ± 60% of DCD cases (Vaivre-Douret et al., 2011).
The investigation of the links between laterality in development and dyslexia is also part of the incentives of the various calls for scientific projects aimed at understanding the mechanisms at play in the late expression of lasting disorders (such as dyslexia constellation).
In addition, the developmental consequences of breech birth would provide a very important source of information for our partners in obstetric hospital services, with a view to guide the evolution of childbirth practices (births by caesarean section vs. routes natural).","Thursday, 5 November, 2020","Monday, 9 November, 2020","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, - Developmental disorders - autism

Firstly, we aim to examine the longitudinal predictors of children's comprehension of written and spoken text (i.e. reading and listening comprehension). More specifically, the study seeks to examine the predictive relationships between cognitive-linguistic skills and children's listening and reading comprehension development across different developmental periods. As the simple view of reading posits (Gough, Hoover, & Peterson, 1996; Hoover & Gough, 1990), spoken text comprehension and decoding are two central subcomponents of reading comprehension. There is an abundance of research evidence showing that once word reading proficiency increases and therefore, ceases to constrain comprehension processes, listening comprehension becomes the most powerful of reading comprehension skills (Adolf, Catts, & Little, 2006; Babayi?it & Stainthorp, in press; Gough & Tunmer, 1986; Kendeou, Savage, & Broek, 2009). Currently, the longitudinal research into children's comprehension of both spoken and written text is highly limited (Oakhill & Cain, 2007). The findings from the proposed study will have implications for furthering our understanding of the causal antecedents of text comprehension skills as well as highlighting early markers of text comprehension difficulties. Furthermore, the findings will help to elucidate the evolving relationships of different oral language and cognitive skills with text comprehension skills. It is widely acknowledged that different subprocessing skills may play different roles along the trajectory of children's literacy development (Tilstra, McMaster, Van den Broek, Kendeou, & Rapp, 2009), hence the importance of longitudinal research that spans wider developmental periods.",null,"Sunday, 23 January, 2011","Sunday, 23 January, 2011","Social Science, Speech & Language"

Recently, it has been observed that common mental health problems in children, such as inattention-hyperactivity and impulse-control problems, are most strongly predicted by epigenetic patterns regulating gene expression at birth â a signal that is curiously lost when measuring these same patterns later in childhood. Such a finding points to the existence of an early biologically-sensitive developmental window and may provide us with crucial insights into the nature and origins of mental health outcomes in children. Yet, how these epigenetic timing effects arise, what factors drive them and why they manifest is currently a puzzle. To solve it, this project will combine (i) the application of innovative, multidisciplinary approaches and (ii) the generation of new data within a unique set of European longitudinal cohorts to systematically characterize, locate and explain epigenetic timing effects on child mental health with unprecedented scale and depth. As well as addressing a major knowledge gap and advancing research at the forefront of biological and psychological sciences, EpiTIME has the potential to set in motion a paradigm shift in the way that we conceptualize, understand and approach mental health in children.","Findings from this project will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between epigenetic variation and mental health problems in children.

We are using a custom version of the Illumina HumanHap 550+ platform with additional content selected by 23andMe. The additional content includes coverage of known common and rare SNP associations; better coverage of drug metabolizing genes; and dense coverage of the Y chromosome, mitochondrial DNA, and the MHC region.  The 23andMe customer cohort and the ALSPAC cohort have substantial differences in demographics, and phenotypes have been assessed very differently. Essentially all 23andMe customer phenotype data is self reported through web based surveys, and unlike ALSPAC, the 23andMe cohort is far from being a cross section of an identifiable population. As a result, we think it is most appropriate to model SNP associations separately in the two cohorts and then combine association test results in a meta-analysis.  For this initial data access proposal, we have enumerated a subset of the ALSPAC phenotypes we are interested in. We would use this data for exploratory purposes, for selection of appropriate models to be used later for genome-wide SNP association testing. We would also use the data to familiarize ourselves with the ALSPAC resource. The association analysis will be conducted later in collaboration with Drs. David Evans and Nic Timpson. In cases where an association has reached genome wide significance in the 23andMe cohort alone, the ALSPAC data can be used as an independent replication. We also expect that additional loci will be revealed with genome-wide significance in the combined meta-analysis. In some cases, we plan to develop new surveys for the 23andMe cohort around research questions that have been examined in ALSPAC, and will perform meta-analyses for those phenotypes later after new survey data is collected.  We think the area of host genetic susceptibility to common infectious disease is particularly interesting and not well studied, despite substantial public health impacts. This includes categorical phenotypes for one-time infections such as measles or mumps, as well as quantitative phenotypes such as frequency of upper respiratory infection and ear ache. We have already identified several associations with infectious disease in the 23andMe customer cohort, and will attempt to replicate these in the ALSPAC cohort.  We do not have the resources or domain knowledge to focus a substantial effort on the analysis of any one phenotype. As a result, our plan is to focus on phenotypes that can be assessed from at most a few survey or clinical exam responses, or where summary derived variables are already available. In the phenotype areas for which we have requested data, we have existing survey data and GWAS results in the 23andMe cohort for laterality, bitter taste perception, myopia, some infections, and dental health. We are planning to deploy surveys for post-partum depression, and have requested related ALSPAC data. We have also requested data for coordination and non-verbal perception tests, where we are considering new surveys.

Individually autoimmune diseases are relatively rare, but together they affect at least 5% of the UK population. The immune response that causes these diseases includes the production of antibodies to cells of the pancreas, gut, and thyroid. These antibodies can be measured in the blood and can act as markers of disease before symptoms occur. The antibodies to cells of the pancreas are highly predictive for type 1 diabetes; when an individual has multiple markers they have a 50-70% risk of developing diabetes in the next decade. These markers can be detected in early life (from 6 months of age) but may arise later and often persist for many years before disease onset. Although markers of autoimmunity have been well studied in family members of individuals with autoimmunity, particularly in childhood, they are rarely studied in people without a family history of disease. Studying markers of pancreatic and co-existing autoimmunity in blood samples from ALSPAC children and parents will complement data from our family-based study and tell us whether some people develop these markers during childhood, adolescence or in later life. Is autoimmunity âexplosiveâ with rapid appearance of autoantibodies followed by clinical onset of symptoms or does it follow a more indolent pathway? This will help us understand why different individuals are diagnosed with autoimmune disease very early in life, while others are diagnosed as adults.","Currently in the UK around 400,000 individuals have type 1 diabetes, but the incidence is increasing by approximately 3% per year. In 2011/2012 the disease cost for the UK was estimated at £1bn in direct and £0.9bn in indirect costs, set to increase to £1.8bn and £2.4bn by 2035/36 (Hex et al. 2012). As one of more than 80 autoimmune diseases whose combined financial cost is unknown, in the long-term, research discoveries about type 1 diabetes may have far reaching benefits. 
The aim of this research is to understand the development of autoimmunity directed to the pancreas, gut and thyroid in the general population and how this impacts the development of type 1 diabetes in later life. In turn, this may help identify the reasons why diabetes is delayed in these individuals, leading to strategies to prevent or delay the disease.  Eighty-five percent of type 1 diabetes patients have no first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes, so studying the natural history of disease in the general population is vital. This project will also add to knowledge of the initiation and development of multiple autoimmunity related to diabetes in the general population. Understanding the natural history of autoimmunity in childhood and adolescence will help develop better clinical strategies for identifying autoimmune disease in the general population.","Wednesday, 20 March, 2019","Thursday, 21 March, 2019","Immunology, Diabetes, Gastrointestinal, Radiobinding autoantibody assays

Coffee consumption has been linked to a wide range of health outcomes including cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive function (1).

Dietary black tea and coffee polyphenols lead to the inhibition of the mammalian DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) (2). Indeed, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, two common catechol-containing coffee polyphenols were previously shown to inhibit DNA methylation (3).

Two studies were recently performed to look at the epigenome-wide impact of coffee intake (4, 5). Of these only one study reported 1 CpG site (close to ALPPL2 gene) associated with coffee consumption (4). This gene was previously shown to be influenced by smoking (6). A recent study has shown a positive association between smoking and caffeine consumption (7) which lead us to believe that the findings from previous coffee consumption epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) may be confounded by smoking.

To address this, we performed an EWAS of coffee consumption and found 19 CpG sites associated with caffeinated coffee intake in EPIC-IARC samples (n=898) adjusting for smoking status.

The overall use of prescription medication (particularly antidepressants) by pregnant women has increased steadily over the past three decades. These medications are able to pass the placental barrier and are secreted in breast milk, which raises concerns about adverse effects on a childâs neurodevelopment. Additionally, maternal mood directly influences fetal and infant development through biological, genetic and indirect environmental mechanisms. Therefore, the benefits and risks of receiving pharmacological treatment during pregnancy must be assessed on an individual basis. Recent studies have demonstrated an increase risk in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when exposed to antidepressants prenatally. However, very little research has explored possible effects of prenatal exposure on the developmental trajectory of cognitive skills and language/communication abilities. To date, no studies have explored possible interactions between medication exposure and genetic factors in these cases.","The goal of this research is to assess the benefits and consequences of taking psychotropic medication during pregnancy. These assessments should be taken on an individual basis, any incremental risk must be weighed against serious consequences of failing to treat depression/anxiety and related disorders. However, in some cases alternative treatment to pharmacological intervention may be warranted and beneficial. Evaluating genetic risks may assist balancing the benefits and risks of prenatal exposure to psychotropic medications.

However, few large prospective longitudinal studies have examined whether these adverse outcomes persist into later childhood (7 years of age). Furthermore, the offspring outcomes are heterogenous and effect sizes are small to moderate. Thus, it is important to elucidate putative mechanisms, i.e. mediating factors, that underly associations between PPD and offspring adverse developmental outcomes. Such insights are crucial to highlight those at greater risk and develop targeted interventions to reduce adverse outcomes in offspring of depressed fathers. A substantial body of evidence suggests that an important potential mediator is the quality of parenting. Specifically, evidence suggests that PPD disrupts paternal levels of involvement with the offspring and quality of parenting (e.g., bonding, enjoyment, confidence), which, in turn, is associated with adverse offspring outcomes, including emotional and behavioural problems. However, few population-based studies have examined potential explanatory role of fathersâ involvement and parenting in the association between PPD and offspring development using longitudinal mediation models.","The role of fathers continues to be overlooked in developmental research, thus, the impact of these findings is likely to be high across several disciplines, including public health, epidemiology and sociology.

Although ASD, ADHD and schizophrenia are categorically defined for clinical purposes, they can also be viewed as the extremes of continuous trait dimensions found in the general population (4,5).",null,"Wednesday, 3 January, 2018","Tuesday, 9 January, 2018","Epidemiology, Developmental disorders - autism, Statistical methods, Genetic epidemiology"

It has been reported that the way in which the baby is born can result in differences in the composition of the microbes that establish themselves in new-borns (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010; Goedert, 2014).  For example, the rate of caesarean (C-section) delivery is increasing worldwide and epidemiological studies report an association between C-section delivery and an increased risk of obesity, asthma, allergies and immune deficiencies (Thavagnanam , 2008; Mueller, 2014; Pistiner, 2008; Round and Mazmanian, 2009; Li, 2013).  These findings have led to investigations into how caesarean-born babies respond to the missing vaginal microbiota being replaced artificially (Dominguez-Bello, 2016).

Obviously, parents and peer have direct impacts on childrenâs development (Bronfenbrenner, 1992) and it is important to take parenting and peer relations into account when investigating children self-identity development and psychological wellbeing.

Previous research has shown that parenting was positively related self-concept and involvement in peer relations (Dekovic & Meeus, 1997), and parenting and friendship quality had the longitudinal effect on internalizing symptoms in early adolescents (Gaertner, Fite, & Colder, 2010). Also, having a clear self-concept was positively associated with adolescentsâ interpersonal relationships such as child-parent relationship and friendship quality (Becht et al., 2017) and mental well-being (e.g., Cross, Gore, & Morris). However, it is currently less well understood how parenting influence the trajectories of self-concept development, peer relations and mental well-being in adolescence and how parenting in early childhood and self-concept and peer relations in early adolescence together contribute mental well-being in late adolescence. Also, though parenting, self and social relationship are important to development, there is few evidences to show which stage, childhood or adolescence contributes more to child development.","Firstly, from the theory perspective, this research has the potential to help researchers to learn more about the trajectory of the children’s development and the association between parenting, self-concept, friendship, and mental wellbeing in different stages of adolescents. 
Secondly, from the practical perspective, given that early adolescence is regard at window of opportunity in the lifespan (Roeser & Pinela, 2014), this research can help researchers in education area to develop some training and exercises aiming to stablish stable and healthy self in early adolescence to assist adolescents to improve social abilities and emotion regulation. 
Also, this research aims to answer the question of which stage is more important to a child’s development. It is beneficial to help researchers to find the vital period for a child development and clarify what is important for a child’s development.","Thursday, 7 June, 2018","Thursday, 24 May, 2018","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Statistical methods, Parenting"

Recent studies, using novel sequencing methods, have shown that as many as 95% of healthy individuals over the age of 60 has evidence of clonal haematopoiesis detectable in their blood.  We know that this increases the risk of these individuals developing blood cancers, but at the moment we are unable to predict which individuals are most at risk. To address this, we need a better understanding of how the growth/ survival of the blood cells harbouring these acquired mutations changes over time (the âevolutionary dynamicsâ) and, ultimately, how this differs in individuals who subsequently develop blood cancers.","Having data on clonal haematopoiesis from young individuals will allow us to see exactly when mutations start to appear in the blood and, having longitudinal data from the same individual, we can truly assess how clones in the same individual change over time.  This, together with data already published in older individuals, will be incredibly valuable for teaching us about the dynamics of haematopoiesis over a lifetime.

Estimates suggest that mental health problems, including depression and self-harm are at least double among those who have been exposed to ACEs. Despite the recognised importance of ACEs to later mental health outcomes, relatively little is known about the characteristics of ACEâs that have the greatest impact. Firstly, many studies have relied on cumulative scores, whereby ACEâs are simply dichotomised and summed. This approach assumes that each ACE contributes equitably to the outcome of interest and that they operate via the same mechanisms. Other research has focused on the relationship between individual ACEsâ and mental health. Although such studies have provided useful insights, it is known that ACEâs often co-occur and most have failed to take account of this clustering. Person centred approaches such as Latent Class Analysis (LCA) could be used to identify variability in ACE profiles between individuals and investigate potential differential associations with mental health, demographic factors, and mechanisms. Secondly, little attention has been paid to the role of timing, chronicity, or recency of exposure in relation to mental health, and findings from existing studies have been inconclusive. Disentangling these effects is challenging as it may be that those who have been exposed earlier in childhood have also been exposed for longer. This PhD will address these limitations and generate valuable new insights into the relationship between ACEs and two  mental health outcomes â depression and self-harm.","Improved understanding of the relationship between ACEs and mental health problems

However, the pattern of inheritance of DNA methylation is unknown. The erasure of DNAM of all genes (except imprinted ones) contradicts with the belief that it is vertically transmitted. We propose that inheritance of DNA methylation of from grandmother (F0) to grandchildren (F2) is conditional upon in utero exposure in the mother(F1). We use a CpG site cg05575921 of the AHRR gene to demonstrate the inheritance of DNAM.

Being born with cleft places a significant burden on children, their families and the health system as they require surgery (multiple times depending on cleft type), and other interventions to improve appearance, speech, hearing, dentition and other adverse outcomes. They are also at increased risk of psychological, psychiatric and cognitive problems [1]. There are several possible mechanisms underlying these associations that may be operating alone or together. First, they may reflect the psychological, developmental and social impacts of clefting and its treatment. Second, they may reflect genetic factors either as pleiotropic outcomes of genetic susceptibility to clefting or as independently inherited genetic risk.

The aetiology of both cleft and of psychiatric disorders is complex, with common risk alleles [3] [4] of individually small effects as well as rare genetic mutations of large effect and environmental factors playing roles. One group of rare mutations of large effect are Copy Number Variants (CNVs), referring to deletion or duplication of a part of the genome leading to differences between individuals in the number of copies of genes within the affected region. CNVs are known to increase risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (ND-CNVs), such as ADHD and autism, as well as mental health disorders but the presence and the impact of CNVs have not been studied in cleft [5].","The PhD project will provide the first detailed description of neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children with cleft and examine the contributions of genetic and environmental factors.

During early adolescence there is a dramatic rise in depressive symptoms in girls compared with boys.  By the mid-teens, girls are twice as likely to experience depression than boys, and this gender difference persists through adult life. Adolescence is, therefore, the key developmental period for the female rise in depression. The timing of the pubertal transition is of interest because early puberty in girls has been linked to a range of adverse outcomes in psychological, social, sexual and educational domains.  Girls who mature earlier than their peers face a cascade of psychosocial challenges that may be inconsistent with their level of cognitive and emotional development. This may lead to feelings of isolation and increased vulnerability to depression.  It is still unclear, however, whether adverse outcomes associated with early puberty translate into longer-term negative consequences for mental health in young women. Timing of puberty could also be important in determining risk for depressive symptoms/depression in boys, but findings are inconsistent and more research is needed. Few studies have examined mechanisms through which timing of puberty affects risk for depressive symptoms/depression. Psychosocial theories propose that individual and social factors explain more of the variance in adolescent depression than hormones alone.","The research findings have the potential to improve identification of young people who are at risk of developing depressive symptoms and depression.   In particular, the research will lead to improved understanding about the role of puberty in determining risk for depression and potentially modifiable mechanisms that underlie this link. This evidence could help to inform the development of interventions and school based programmes to reduce the risk of depression in young people. Interventions could be tailored to the distinct needs of young people at different stages of pubertal maturation, increasing the possibility of delivering services to young people who are most likely to benefit.","Friday, 5 April, 2019","Friday, 5 April, 2019","Epidemiology, Mental health, Statistical methods, Puberty"

However, whether they are indicative of the risk of young people developing serious mental disorders remains unclear. Such symptoms assessed in young people in clinical or high-risk settings have provided support for âstagingâ models for serious mental disorders. In these models, sub-threshold symptoms are hypothesized to progress to later stages of psychosis and mood disorders. In order to understand whether such staging models are valid for young people in the community, it is necessary to study cohorts of young people recruited from the community who are prospectively followed over time. Such cohorts also help avoid biases associated with selecting participants or their recall of symptoms. We propose to examine the ALSPAC cohort to determine whether subthreshold mood and psychotic symptoms in early adolescence progress to later stages (threshold stages) of these disorders, or predict difficulties in functioning in young adulthood. Specifically, we will examine the symptoms of mania, depression and psychosis in young adulthood. We propose to compare those with and without progressive symptoms of these mental disorders with respect to their birth, early life and parental characteristics in order to identify predictors of later difficulties. We also propose to examine the role of intermediate or late adolescent life events or substance use in the progression of mental health symptoms.

This research concerns existing evidence for associations between early puberty in girls and risky behaviors. Such behaviors include risky sexual behaviors (including earlier sexual experiences, unprotected sex and teenage pregnancy) and risky health behaviors (such as alcohol and substance misuse). Although there have been numerous observational reports of links between early puberty and risky behaviors, there have also been inconsistencies. For example, some studies report associations to be persistent into adulthood, whereas others suggest that effects are only present in early, but not late, adolescence. Furthermore, observational studies have numerous limitations, including confounding, reverse causality and bias, which make findings difficult to interpret. Thus, it is currently unclear whether associations between early puberty and risky behaviors in girls may be causal. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard of epidemiological research methods, testing causal associations between early puberty and risky behaviors is not possible within an RCT design. Alternatively, Mendelian randomization allows the testing of causal relationships between exposure and outcome within a genetically informed design. We propose to test the causal relationship between early puberty in girls and risky behavior using a Mendelian randomization design.",null,"Wednesday, 10 May, 2017","Wednesday, 17 May, 2017","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Statistical methods, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Development, Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc., Puberty"

Education is strongly associated with fertility, and after Mills et al fertility GWAS it's becoming increasingly apparent that this is likely to be causal. We only have limited evidence about why there are fertility differences by education. E.g. it could just be preferences, i.e. more education leads people to want fewer children, it could be because those with more education typically have less time after they complete education to start a family, or it could be because education makes people likely to find a partner. On the latter point, there is some evidence that men are reluctant to choose a partner who is more educated than they are. This may make it harder for educated women to find a partner.

People prefer to date and marry facially attractive individuals. The preference for more attractive partners is warranted from an evolutionary perspective, given that facially attractive individuals have higher reproductive success than their less attractive counterparts and facial attractiveness is generally thought to indicate genetic quality in terms of disease resistance. People are also more likely to ascribe positive personality attributes to form same-sex appliances, employ and even vote for facially attractive individuals. Despite historical beliefs, facial attractiveness is not merely an arbitrary cultural convention. People from different cultures show strong agreement in what is considered facially attractive. Even young infants who have not been exposed to cultural norms, prefer to look at faces that adults describe as facially attractive. Previous studies have identified several facial cues (eg sexual dimorphism and symmetry) and hormones (eg testosterone and cortisol) that play a role in facial attractiveness. Yet despite the high estimated heritability of facial attractiveness, very few studeis have accessed the genetic variation underlying facial attractiveness. To our knowledge, only the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been investigated as candidate genes for facial attractiveness. Roberts et al found that HLA heterozygous men (ie men that have differenc copies of the HLA genes) were considered more attractive than HLA homozygous men (ie men that have similar copies of the HLA genes). Follow up studies have replicated this association in male, but not female subjects. Recent studies have shown that genome wide association (GWA) studies can successfully identify common genetic variants and genes which regulate quantitative heritable traits such as height and facial morphology. GWA studies therefore provide a more robust approach to identifying common genetic variants that are associated with facial attractiveness compared to candidate gene approaches that have been used for HLA).",null,"Thursday, 11 April, 2013","Thursday, 11 April, 2013","Face Shape , GWAS, Genetics"

If children are born in September, then they are nearly five when they start school, but if they are born in August in the following chronological year then they have only just turned four years old when the school year starts. Studies have shown that the youngest children within a school year are at an increased risk for mental health problems, social impairment, neurodevelopmental disorder and intellectual disability diagnoses, and lower educational attainment (Bedard & Dhuey, 2006; ZoÃ«ga et al., 2012; PottegÃ¥rd et al, 2014; Root et al., 2019).  Cross-national comparisons of large representative population surveys that compare countries with different school entry dates have suggested that associations may reflect causal influences of age within school year on these outcomes, rather than season-of-birth (Goodman et al., 2003). This project will focus on children with early neurodevelopmental vulnerability, which will be defined using neurodevelopmental symptoms and diagnoses, genetic risk, or prematurity of birth. These children are all already at a higher risk of mental health problems including depression (Rice et al., 2018). We hypothesise that relative age effects may affect these groups of children more than others over development from childhood to adulthood. We also hypothesise that differences in mental health by month of birth will emerge only after school entry but show some persistence across the school years into early adulthood.","This project will likely be impactful as it aims to be assess whether age at school entry is causally associated with later mental health difficulties in specific at-risk groups. The project will help identify those children who are at highest risk of later mental health problems, and who are therefore a priority for early support and preventative intervention. 
Furthermore, identifying a group(s) of children who would benefit from delaying school entry has potentially significant individual, family and societal benefits. Currently, guidance in England and Wales indicates that it is possible to delay school entry if there is a ‘compelling reason’. However, decisions on deferred school entry are often left to individual school admission boards, and policy varies between the devolved nations. The project will provide comprehensive evidence on whether children at risk should be rigidly assigned to school entry based on date of birth or given greater flexibility regarding school entry, taking into account developmental maturity. Therefore, the findings of this project would be of significant interest to parents, carers, and teachers of premature children and children with neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as charities that advocate for these groups. The findings will also be of interest to the Welsh Government, UK Government, and local education authorities.","Friday, 15 November, 2019","Sunday, 17 November, 2019","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Statistical methods, Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Environment - enviromental exposure, pollution, Genetic epidemiology, Statistical methods"

Often such policies combine pronatalism ideology (reproduction as an intrinsic good) with a commitment to individual autonomy. The concept of reproductive liberty, however, fails to acknowledge the necessity of government assistance in facilitating reproductive choice, and a gap is emerging between the language of ârightsâ to particular services and access to those services.

Research to date exploring access to fertility services has focussed on the impact of involuntarily childlessness, but there has been scant attention to the related, but important, question of why people choose to have children in the first place.  The lack of empirical literature exploring the reasons why people do reproduce is evidence in itself of the generally unquestioned acceptance of pronatalism, suggesting the decision to have children needs less scrutiny than the decision not to. The questions we propose to include in ALSPAC will explore the reasons people have for making reproductive decisions, with a view to facilitating a better understanding of the reasons behind reproductive decisions.   This, in turn, will help us to build a more complete understanding of the relative importance of being able to access fertility services and the value people place on specific means of reproduction and parenting, which can feed into analysis of arguments about the funding of fertility services.","Understanding the social reasons for young peoples thoughts on whether they want to become parents or not and if so their preferences for different methods will provide information on current factors such as the economic recession, costs of further education, etc. on such decisions. Furthermore, with longer-term follow-up we will also be able to determine whether these early adult life opinions relate to having children and the timing of having those children. Lastly, as similar questions are being asked of a Bristol cohort of couples undergoing IVF we will be able to explore attitudes towards different methods of becoming a parent between those who do not (currently) have a fertility problem and those who do.
In addition, the data will help us to better understand how and why people anticipate becoming parents in particular ways, which can be used to feed into explorations of important questions about access to and funding for fertility services.","Monday, 13 August, 2018","Tuesday, 14 August, 2018","Reproduction, biosocial and bioethics, Fertility/infertility, Pregnancy - e.g. reproductive health, postnatal depression, birth outcomes, etc., Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics, Offspring, Parenting"

Poor quality diet is the top contributor to mortality globally, and is estimated to cost the NHS Â£6billion per year.

The period of adolescence to early adulthood (age  13 to 30) is the time when prevalence of overweight and obesity develops most rapidly, making this an important time to understand the contribution of diet to these developing risk factors. Adolescence and early adulthood is a time of rapid personal development, changing lifestyles, and is the time when adult behaviours, including adult dietary patterns, are developed and established.  Understanding the factors that influence development of diet is an important first step in developing strategies to change behaviour.

There is limited data available on changes in diet through adolescence and early adulthood in the UK.  Self-reported diet data is notoriously biased, however recent advances in biomarker research have established several biomarkers that are reliable indicators of consumption of specific foods and food groups.  In this project we will analyse blood samples from the ALSPAC cohort, taken at age 13, 15, 17, 24 and 30, to derive measures of intake of fruit and vegetable, dairy and fish intake.

We will use these measures of diet to assess (1) changes in diet across adolescence and early adulthood, (2) associations between socioeconomic changes in adolescence and early adulthood and changes in diet,  (3) the role of changes in diet in pathways linking socioeconomic determinants and risk factors  for cardiovascular disease.","Collection of this data will allow research which helps us to understand the role of diet within pathways which lead from socioeconomic determinants to cardiovascular and metabolic disease. In particular this research will provide information on the populations at risk for development of poor diet during early adulthood, and suggest opportunities for public health intervention. For example research based on this data could identify particular population groups or particular early adulthood life transitions that increase risk of a poor quality diet, suggesting a particular targets for intervention.
In addition, the analysis of nutritional biomarkers across this age range will feed data back into the ALSPAC cohort, for future analysis.

Incredibly, there is no drug that a subfertile man can take, nor that can be added to his sperm in vitro, to improve sperm motility.

Mendelian randomisation uses genetic variants associated with an exposure (e.g., smoking) to examine causal pathways between the exposure and outcomes. Previous genetic instruments for smoking have only captured discrete aspects (e.g., initiation, heaviness of smoking), limiting power and requiring individual level data on smoking status for analyses of heaviness of smoking. To overcome these issues, we are developing a novel genetic instrument for comprehensive smoking exposure, which takes into account duration of smoking, heaviness of smoking, time since cessation, and a simulated half-life constant to capture the exponentially decreasing effect of smoking on health over time. Our instrument includes both smokers and non-smokers, removing the need to stratify on smoking status.

We have begun work on this instrument by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of our comprehensive smoking measure in the UK Biobank (N=463,003) and identified 124 independent SNPs associated at the genome-wide level of significance. Our two-sample Mendelian randomisation validation analysis confirmed that smoking causes lung cancer and coronary heart disease. To further establish the validity of the instrument we need to check that it predicts smoking in an independent sample. Here we hope to use ALSPAC, checking whether a polygenic risk score for lifetime smoking exposure predicts actual smoking behaviour. Secondly, we need to check that the instrument is not spuriously associated with any traits other than smoking. We can do this by checking for associations with other outcomes in ALSPAC.

If the instrument predicts smoking in ALSPAC and is not associated with other unexpected traits, we hope to go onto use our novel genetic instrument to explore bi-directional effects between smoking and mental health, focusing on schizophrenia and major depressive disorder.","If this is a valid genetic instrument of lifetime smoking exposure then it will be used very widely across Mendelian Randomisation studies, being widely cited.","Tuesday, 3 April, 2018",null,"Genetic epidemiology (including association studies and mendelian randomisation), Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., PheWAS, Genetic epidemiology"

However, despite the ubiquity of sexual assault, many individuals do not develop any PTSD or other psychiatric disorders. Predicting which individuals may be at higher risk of PTSD, and identifying clinical and biological factors that lead to resilience or disease risk will be vital to developing new treatments and therapies, and in matching patients to appropriate, timely interventions. We propose to use environmental, genetic and methylation data from the ALSPAC cohort, to identify the key factors influencing psychiatric disease risk and resilience after sexual assault.","First and foremost, our research highlights the importance of understanding and ending sexual assault. Our existing studies already demonstrate the outsized role that sexual assault has in shaping the lives and experience of survivors; however, the ubiquity of sexual assault, and the huge role of sexual assault in PTSD development, is not yet appreciated. We hope that our work will highlight this.

Second, we describe a simple and useful model to study resilience to trauma. PTSD studies to date have focused on the severity of PTSD, or case-control status, without taking trauma into account. Our model may be easily applied to a range of trauma types and cohorts.

Third, by identifying genetic, epigenetic, and environmental predictors of resilience, we hope to understand the biological mechanisms of PTSD and wellness. Identifying these mechanisms and pathways will allow us to improve care for survivors, and hopefully to develop new therapeutics and interventions.","Friday, 28 June, 2019","Monday, 1 July, 2019","Genetics, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Developmental disorders - autism, Cognitive impairment, Eating disorders - anorexia, bulimia, Learning difficulty, Mental health, Obesity, Sexually transmitted diseases, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, Sexual assault

Research suggests that a significant proportion of the social gradient in health is due to SES differences in health-risk behaviors. Scholarship investigating the underlying mechanisms whereby lower SES increases health-risk behavior points to the mediating role of risk-increasing (or âriskogenicâ) psychosocial schemas. Specifically, evidence suggests that social context and experiences in development, which are patterned by oneâs social position, calibrate psychosocial orientations, including impulsivity or self-control, sensation seeking, and hostile views of relationships, which influence health-risk behaviors and health outcomes. Although the past decade has seen a spate of published GE-health research, few studies have focused on the role of G-E interplay in shaping psychosocial schemas as mechanisms through which SES adversity shapes health disparities. This project will investigate the effects of SES adversity on changes in psychosocial schemas, conceived as socially-calibrated and genetically-influenced endophenotypes which link SES adversity to increased health risk-behaviors. Additionally, although we know that social experiences âget under the skinâ to have enduring effects on health outcomes, we lack knowledge on the biological pathways through which such effects persist. Thus, second, and more innovatively, we will engage with the nascent field of social epigenetics to examine DNA methylation (DNAm) as a biological mechanism through which SES-adversity calibrates psychosocial schemas. In this project, we will investigate the DNAm patterns underlying psychosocial adaptations to SES adversity that increase health-risk behaviors, building on work that identifies DNAm as an important molecular underpinning of experience-dependent changes in cognitions, decision-making, and behavior.","The rationale for this research is the need to better understand what, when, and how social adversity increases ‘riskogenic’ psychosocial schemas influencing health-risk behaviors in the context of G-E interplay. In addition to enhancing scientific knowledge, findings may identify biomarkers of exposure or response to SES adversity to enhance risk assessments or targeted interventions to improve health.

Good mental health influences the capacity to thrive and flourish, while conversely, poor mental health affects indices as diverse as physical well-being and health, work satisfaction and achievements, and a range of interpersonal relationships. Yet, poor mental health characterizes up to a quarter of the UK adult population [3]. Given that many adult psychosocial difficulties (e.g. depression, substance use, unemployment) can be traced to neurodevelopmental difficulties in childhood [4], investigating early risk pathways is crucial for early detection and prevention [5]. There is good evidence in animal studies, and increasing evidence in humans, that early-life adversity can promote chronic, low-grade inflammation [6] and vulnerability for later mental health problems - and may do so through the immune systemâs role in brain development. The âhidden wounds hypothesisâ [7] indeed proposes that early psychosocial adversity translate into biological risk for mental illness by negatively affecting the role of the immune system in brain development [8]. Of interest, inflammatory markers can cross into the brain through several routes (e.g. afferent fibers, vagus nerve, permeable blood brain barrier) and (in animals) modulate synaptogenesis, synaptic refinement and survival, as well as myelination [8, 9]. Recent evidence also suggests that DNA methylation, a type of epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression, may be a biological mechanism by which adversity can result in low-grade chronic inflammation through affecting the regulation of genes involved in inflammation [10].  However, in humans, little is known about how adversity in different developmental periods may affect immune-related DNA methylation, which in turn could influence neurodevelopmental and mental health problems.",null,"Wednesday, 8 November, 2017","Tuesday, 5 December, 2017","Social Science, Fertility/infertility, Gastrointestinal, Epigenetics, Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc."

Because of the increased exposure to high ROS levels produced during respiration, lack of protective histones, and limited capacity for DNA repair[3,4] human mtDNA carries a large number of mutations that have segregated during evolution. Some of these genetic variants are used to define mtDNA haplogroups, and a few of them slightly modify metabolic performance and energy production; thus not all haplogroups have identical metabolic capacities[1]. It has been hypothesized that the geographic distribution of mtDNA haplogroups is the result of the selection of metabolic properties driven mainly by adaptation to climate and nutrition[1].

Nine mtDNA haplogroups have been identified in Europeans (namely H, I, J, K, T, U, V, W, X) which show varying frequencies by population.

Weight variability, or how much body weight varies over time independent of total weight loss or gains, might be predictive of later weight and health risk outcomes. Weight variability in adults has been associated with weight gain over a period of 18 months (Lowe et al 2015), and variability in week-to-week weight change in a weight loss program was associated with poorer long-term weight loss (Feig & Lowe submitted). In addition, research has suggested that weight variability is associated with adverse health problems including cardiovascular risk factors, heart disease, and stroke (Lissner 1991; French 1997). It is important to understand individual differences in weight variability because it may predate an increase in weight and ultimately the development of overweight or obesity, or the development of health risk factors. One explanation is that elevated weight variability is a marker of a breakdown of the body weight regulatory system that is weakened by biological or environmental factors. Therefore identifying these predictors of susceptibility to weight gain and health risks prior to the onset of health and weight problems could be useful in disease prevention. Little is known about weight variability in young children or infants. In this study we will look at weight variability in infancy and childhood as a predictor of later weight gain, as well as other physiological variables reflective of medical risk (e.g. blood pressure).

Children with ADHD are at high risk of developing antisocial behavior, substance abuse and other psychiatric disorders, consequently presenting difficulties in their education and social integration.

ADHD does not obey the classical laws of Mendelian inheritance, making it difficult to pinpoint the genes involved. Despite the early advances of candidate gene approaches, subsequent progress in unraveling genetics of ADHD has been rather slow. So far, association studies of ADHD yielded risk variants that (1) generally tend to have small effect sizes or be rare, (2) often refer to co-occurring conditions and (3) lack consistent replication. Even the most comprehensive genome-wide scans available with thousands of patients still appear to result in variants accounting for a relatively small proportion of disorder expression. Thus, there is a growing need for pursuing approaches alternative to dominating association studies.

This project proposes the examination of epigenetic factors in ADHD. Epigenetics concerns alterations in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in DNA sequence. These modifications have been shown to be dynamic and may be reversible throughout life, even in fully differentiated brain cells. As epigenetic mechanisms contribute to several neuropsychiatric disorders, we suggest the investigation a well-known process: parent-of-origin effect (POE).

POE is an umbrella term for a range of genetic and epigenetic phenomena inflecting the development of complex traits. POE have already been implicated in psychiatric health, with documented evidence in schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder. Nonetheless, little is known about POE in ADHD, with conflicting results dominating the field.

The hypothesis of POE in ADHD may be supported by several previous studies. The variability in ADHD phenotype was shown to vary depending on parental ADHD history and syndromes with ADHD symptomatology exhibit clinical evidence of POE. Furthermore, it is well-established that the expression of growth-enhancing genes such as IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) is regulated through imprinting, while suboptimal prenatal environment resulting in low birth weight or preterm birth can increase the risk for adverse neurobehavioral outcomes, including ADHD.

Currently, there is no methodology to properly investigate POE (especially for continuous phenotypes), meaning that all previous studies on POE in ADHD are subject of much debate and little replication. This project will be performed in collaboration with BROAD Institute of Harvard and MIT (Boston, MA, USA), where we will be working on the development of new methodology as well as the analyses of the data.",null,"Wednesday, 12 April, 2017","Wednesday, 12 April, 2017","Genetics, Mental health, Epigenetics, GWAS, Statistical methods, parent of origin effects, Biomarkers - e.g. cotinine, fatty acids, haemoglobin, etc., Genetics - e.g. epigenetics, mendelian randomisation, UK10K, sequencing, etc., Methods - e.g. cross cohort analysis, data mining, mendelian randomisation, etc., Nutrition - breast feeding, diet, Statistical methods, mental health"

Data sharing refers to researchers sharing study data at the end of a study with other researchers for further research.

I have designed a questionnaire to capture participant attitudes, drawing on questions asked in previous research (outwith the UK) on this topic.

Little research has been conducted exploring the attitudes of study participants to this sharing of their data and what limited findings there are, largely relate to settings outside of the UK. Although participants may give their consent for their data to be shared when they join a research study, they may not fully understand what this means.

By asking study participants to complete a questionnaire about data sharing we can find out what their attitudes towards it are.

The survey will be distributed to as wide a variety of participants as possible (both in terms of location and type of study they

took part in). This increases the generalisability of the results- they are more likely to apply to the wider population.

It is hoped that the data collected in the survey will show what participants attitudes are likely to be- how they would prefer to

consent to data sharing, how much information about it they would like at the beginning of a study and if they have any

concerns about the concept and processes. This information could then be used by researchers to modify the consent process, the way in which data sharing is explained to participants or the way in which data is shared.","Primarily this research will form the basis of my PhD thesis, and I hope to publish the results of this study in a peer reviewed journal. This research may also provide a useful starting point for other researchers who are seeking to be more transparent in their research (specifically data sharing) practice. Policy makers, funders (for example MRC, ESRC, NIHR), or organisations such as universities or clinical trial units who either make stipulations regarding data sharing or who draw up consent forms and patient information sheets will find it useful to consult this piece of research in order to ensure that research practice aligns with the attitudes and expectations of participants. 
I will also disseminate my findings thorough the UKCRC (UK Registered Clinical Trials Unit Network) Data Sharing group of which I am a member.","Friday, 7 June, 2019","Monday, 10 June, 2019","Clinical research/clinical practice, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Quantitative questionnaire survey with statistical analysis., Cohort studies - attrition, bias, participant engagement, ethics"

There are many potential reasons for this link, such as, (1) too much school work may cause short-sightedness, (2) short-sighted children may be more studious or “bookish” and therefore perform better at school than children with good eyesight, (3) one or more outside factors may cause both short-sightedness and better school performance. Conventional studies of the relationship between education and short-sightedness cannot answer whether options 1, 2 or 3 above is/are correct. Therefore, instead, we propose to use a method called “Mendelian randomisation” that is able to find the answers to this question. Mendelian randomisation uses naturally-occurring genetic differences between individuals to identify children who are – because of their genetics – very slightly more likely than average to become short-sighted, or very slightly more likely than average to do well at school. The technique works by examining the school performance of children who are slightly genetically predisposed to become short-sighted, and examining the eyesight of children who are slightly genetically predisposed to do well at school.",null,"Friday, 8 July, 2016","Thursday, 21 July, 2016","Epidemiology, Myopia, Statistical methods, Mendelian randomisation, Vision, myopia, education, mendelian randomisation"

It is a dynamic process beginning with tooth surface loss that eventually leads to cavities. Untreated caries can lead to pain, swelling, abscesses and in extreme cases, systemic blood infection (Monse et al., 2009). In western developed countries, the diet of adolescent populations is very rich in carbonated drinks and high-carbohydrate snack foods, also associated with a higher caries risk (Majewski, 2001). Although caries is a physical condition many psychosocial factors are involved, such as attitudes and behaviour re: oral hygiene, education level and access to dental care. Over and above other physical causes of adolescent caries (poor oral health, poor diet and subsequent chemical processes) maternal psychosocial factors are also an indicator of subsequent caries experience in their adolescent children (Nelson et al, 2012).",null,"Thursday, 19 June, 2014","Thursday, 26 June, 2014","Diet, Parenting"

Prospective studies of long-term psychosocial outcomes (particularly internalizing problems) are lacking. A few prospective studies on long-term psychosocial outcomes of prenatal alcohol exposure have focused on externalizing problems such as conduct problems, aggression and incarceration. Emerging literature indicates that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with internalizing problems such as depression. However, it is not clear whether prenatal alcohol exposure effects on internalizing problems are independent from effects on externalizing problems and neurocognitive deficits.

Despite the success of the vaccine there are recent reports of disease in older adolescents and young children who have been vaccinated and the causes for these failures are unknown but are likely to stem from our poor understanding of exactly which components of the bacteria causing the disease (B. pertussis) should be targeted. The ALSPAC team have recently published a study demonstrating that genetic differences in a key region of the human genome, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, may be associated with differential susceptibility to whooping cough. We have similarly undertaken a genetic study of African children finding associations across the same region of HLA with differential response to three different parts of the whooping cough vaccine. We would like to use sophisticated genetic techniques to compare our results with those from ALSPAC to determine whether we can show that reponses to one or several vaccine components is related to whooping cough susceptibility. These results will enable us to understand why the vaccine is failing in some groups of individuals and how we can improve the vaccine for multiple populations in the future.","We believe that our study will offer a novel approach to understanding how immune responses to vaccines may be correlated with vaccine success that in turn will enable a better appreciation of correlates of protection.

To compare the influence of physical activity on grip strength at different ages across the lifecourse 3. To explore the relationship between physical activity and subsequent grip strength trajectory. Evidence, mainly from age-heterogenous cross-sectional studies1 suggest that muscle strength, as assessed by grip strength, increases through childhood and adolescence, reaching a peak in early adult life before declining with increasing age. As no one cohort has repeated measures of strength for the same individuals from childhood to old age, it is necessary to combine repeated measures from several cohorts in order to construct a lifecourse trajectory of muscle strength. The cross-council funded HALCyon cohort consortium has already harmonised measures of physical capability, including grip strength, in eight UK cohorts spanning ages 50-90+ years.2 Similarly, the FALCon project has worked to develop and disseminate methods for the lifecourse modelling of physical and cognitive function, as well as cardiovascular function such as blood pressure.3 There is therefore the opportunity to continue work from both projects to look at the lifecourse trajectory of grip strength. In childhood and adolescence, we hypothesise that higher levels of CPA may predict a higher absolute values of muscle strength as well as a greater relative increase in strength towards the subsequent peak in early adult life.

Administration of nitrous oxide during labour appears to be a risk factor for adult amphetamine addiction in offspring [1], and administration of opiates and/or barbiturates and/or nitrous oxide is a risk factor for opiate addiction [2, 3]. These studies all used the same subjects: 200 amphetamine addicts and 200 opiate addicts born in Stockholm between 1945 and 1966. The addicts were compared to their siblings in a matched case control study. The mechanism contributing to this drug addiction in adults is thought to stem partly from an imprinting process during birth when certain drugs are given to the mother. The unconscious memory of the drugged state at birth might make the individual more disposed to become addicted if exposed as an adult. We are keen to investigate these associations further using the ALSPAC data. We know that there is basic information available on the labour analgesia given to the mothers of the ALSPAC children. We assume that at some stage in the next few years you will be doing projects on drug use / misuse / addiction, and that it would be relatively easy to relate the labour information to prospectively collected data.",null,"Tuesday, 14 July, 2009","Tuesday, 14 July, 2009","Cancer, Drugs"

One factor that has been previously associated with the transition to secondary school is a loss in academic achievement. Previous research has suggested a number of factors are related to differing levels of educational success, however, it is unknown how these factors may interact when taking the school transition into consideration.

The academic ability this project is focusing on is maths attainment. Theoretical and empirical research has suggested that maths skills can be altered by mental health issues and memory deficits, as well as parent-child interactions and the schooling environment.

To assess which factors are the most important for maths achievement, the project is investigating biological, psychological, social and environmental factors over 3 stages: pre-school transition, during school transition, and post-school transition.

In the pre-school transition stage, early life factors including a healthy pregnancy and birth as well as the childâs psychological attributes and early parent-child interactions will be explored. Following this, during the transition to secondary school, the focus of investigation will be on the schooling environment and teacher characteristics. The childâs psychological wellbeing and peer relationships during this time will also be examined. After the transition, the variables discussed previously will be investigated to examine whether they can predict later maths attainment at age 16.

To investigate this the study will utilise data from over 14,000 mothers and their children followed up extensively since before birth to assess which prenatal, pre-transition, during transition, and post-transition factors are the most important for improving maths abilities at age 16. A wide range of biological, psychological, and social factors will be investigated. The study predicts that prenatal issues will negatively impact early maths abilities, while positive relationships with parents and peers will lessen their effects. It is predicted that positive school experiences and teacher attitudes will also decrease this impact. Furthermore, it is predicted that greater mental health issues and lower cognitive abilities will decrease attainment.",null,"Tuesday, 16 January, 2018","Wednesday, 17 January, 2018","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Mental health, Statistical methods, Childhood - childcare, childhood adversity, Cognition - cognitive function, Development, Intelligence - memory, Parenting, Psychology - personality, Statistical methods"

Further investigation is required to confirm if these previously found genetic variants are predictive of alcohol, tobacco or caffeine use in specific subpopulations in ALSPAC; in adults (as a positive control), pregnancy, and adolescence. These variants may also have considerable pleiotropic effects, affecting the outcome through pathways other than the exposure of interest. As consumption of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine is highly comorbid with mental health problems, it is possible that common genetic variants are predisposing individuals for both an increased consumption of these substances, and development of mental health problems.

Weexplored the potentially beneficial effects of support giving by examining theneural substrates of giving support to a loved one. We focused on a prioriregions of interest in the ventral striatum and septal area (SA) because oftheir role in maternal caregiving behavior in animals.

METHODS: Twentyromantic couples completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging session inwhich the female partner underwent a scan while her partner stood just outsidethe scanner and received unpleasant electric shocks.

RESULTS: Support giving(holding a partner's arm while they experienced physical pain), compared withother control conditions, led to significantly more activity in the ventralstriatum, a reward-related region also involved in maternal behavior (p valuesless than  .05). Similar effects were observed for the SA, a region involved in bothmaternal behavior and fear attenuation. Greater activity in each of theseregions during support giving was associated with greater self-reported supportgiving effectiveness and social connection (r values = 0.55-0.64, p values less than .05). In addition, in line with the SA's role in fear attenuation (presumablyto facilitate caregiving during stress), increased SA activity during supportgiving was associated with reduced left (r = -0.44, p less than  .05) and right (r =-0.42, p less than  .05) amygdala activity.

Folate, for instance, plays a key role in fetal development and can significantly reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTD). Folate is available in small quantities in many foods however it is recommended that women supplement with folic acid (synthetic form of folate) daily during pregnancy. The association between insufficient folate and NTD has led to several countries recommending the fortification of foods such as flour and cereal grains with folic acid. In addition to a putative role of maternal folate deficiency in fetal development, blood folate levels have been linked, albeit inconsistently, to risk of various cancers in population-based studies. It is believed that one mechanism through which folate may influence subsequent adverse developmental outcomes and cancer risk in early life is via differential DNA methylation (a form of gene regulation) in blood. Consequently, our proposed research aims to further interrogate an effect of one-carbon micronutrient levels on various cancer outcomes, in addition to examining whether a putative effect of one-carbon micronutrient levels on both adverse developemental outcomes and cancer may operate through epigenetic mechanisms in early life. To perform these analyses we will use genome-wide association data derived from previous analyses performed in ALSPAC (B2104) to 1) estimate the causal effect of genetically-proxied blood folate on various adult cancers (using previously published summary GWAS data for these cancers), and 2) to examine the effect of genetic risk scores for various one-carbon micronutrients on DNA methylation profiles in children.",,"Thursday, 5 July, 2018","Wednesday, 18 July, 2018","Genetic epidemiology (including association studies and mendelian randomisation), Epigenetics, Genetic epidemiology, Metabolic - metabolism"

Sustained maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with aberrant DNA methylation reported in large-scale epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of cord blood (1,2). Associations are also seen with paternal smoking, although these largely attenuate when adjusted for maternal smoking (explained by the correlation of maternal and paternal smoking habits). However, all the EWAS for prenatal smoking exposure performed in cord blood to date have focused on autosomes and sex chromosomes have been previously excluded from the analysis. We propose that methylation changes induced in sex chromosomes may have biological importance and we seek to specifically analyse these in the Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies (ARIES).

In addition, body weight gain contributes to higher (mostly abdominal) body fat later in life, as compared with body weight maintenance. Body fat that is stored in the abdomen (android body fat) is strongly associated with the risk of cardiometabolic disease, whereas peripheral body fat (gynoid body fat) is believed to be less detrimental for cardiometabolic health. Cardiometabolic disease is accompanied by changes in the blood metabolic profile, such as changes in cholesterol, fatty acids, amino acids and factors related to inflammatory processes. It is not known whether body fat measures, such as total body fat, trunk fat, leg fat and arm fat, measured during childhood and adolescence are associated with changes in the metabolite profile at young adulthood. Additionally, it is not known whether or how the metabolite profile changes following the onset of puberty, and whether these changes can be attributed to prior changes in body composition.

Therefore, we will examine the change in the metabolite profile following the onset of puberty, and we will examine the relation between fat indices at different stages of development (e.g. before and after puberty) and changes in the metabolite profile. In addition, it is known that men and women have a different body fat distribution, with men having more trunk fat, and women having more leg fat. We will examine whether the regional fat indices in men and women differentially associate with changes in the metabolic profile during childhood and adolescence.","Metabolites are important intermediates of phenotypes and disease, and therefore contribute to research on the underlying mechanisms of disease. However, there is lack of longitudinal studies in metabolomics, therefore little is known about changes in metabolite profiles. This research will contribute to unravelling the metabolic changes before, during and after puberty, and whether these metabolic changes are attributable to changes in body composition with use of repeated measures of metabolites in ALSPAC. Thereby, this research will contribute to elucidating the critical periods when the first indications of cardiometabolic disease later in life (as changes in metabolite levels) will develop.","Thursday, 12 September, 2019","Monday, 16 September, 2019","Epidemiology, Obesity, Metabolomics, Metabolic - metabolism"

Psychotic experiences range from short-lived symptoms that are not fully believed through to persistent severe symptoms that characterise psychotic illnesses as schizophrenia.  It is well established that enduring psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia have worse physical health than the general population, and are at an increased risk of developing long-term physical health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. This may be due to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, such as a lack of physical activity and smoking. Such risk factors begin early in first-episode psychosis and even before the first episode. However, the causal relationship between poor physical health and psychosis is not fully understood. We think poor physical health and psychosis may occur independently of each other, but are both related to earlier more common mental health difficulties, such as depression and anxiety.

Not everyone who experiences mental health difficulties will go on to develop psychosis or physical health problems. For those who do, recovery is possible. Medication and supportive relationships are known to help with recovery, however less is known about the role of romantic relationships specifically.

This research project aims to explore how these factors interact over time within the ALSPAC dataset.","The evidence gained from this project will provide clinically important novel insights into the relationship between non-specific mental health problems and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, physical morbidity, social relationships and psychosis. 
The findings of this project will have direct implications for the design of interventions relating to what may be early predictors of psychosis and physical morbidity: depression, anxiety and negative symptoms.  Additionally this project will provide an understanding about the role social and in particular, romantic relationships play in the development of psychosis and physical health difficulties.
Additionally, if romantic relationships are found to moderate the associations in this model, this may provide an incentive for services to review their approach to and provision of support in this area. Therefore, the outputs of this project potentially have implications for mental and public health services and could ultimately result in changes to the time frame of interventions. We therefore expect this project will result in highly cited academic publications as well as translational impact on clinical practice.","Wednesday, 31 July, 2019","Tuesday, 6 August, 2019","Mental health - Psychology, Psychiatry, Cognition, Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Mental health, Statistical methods, BMI, Cardiovascular, Metabolic - metabolism, Physical - activity, fitness, function, Sleep, Statistical methods, psychosis, relationships, mental health, depression, anxiety, smoking"

Comorbidity between ED and anxiety (ANX) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is typical, with about two-thirds of individuals with ED also reporting lifetime ANX (including OCD). Comorbidity adversely impacts prognosis and time to recovery. Most ED and ANX phenotypes onset during adolescence, and evidence points to shared risk at the genetic level. ED and ANX phenotypes are moderately heritable. Genetic risk scores (GRS), which combine weighted risk from common variant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome, are effective in defining psychiatric risk, although the focus has typically been on diagnoses. Integrating genetic risk information across multiple ED- and ANX- phenotypes could enhance predictive power of GRS while also specifying whether this genetic risk is best understood through a single factor vs. multiple factors. For instance, multiple metabolic, anthropometric, and psychiatric traits share genetic risk with AN. ANX also shows significant genetic overlap with psychiatric traits but less so with anthropometric and metabolic traits, suggesting shared risk between ED and ANX with psychiatric traits, but differential risk with metabolic and anthropometric traits. We will investigate this empirically using genomic structural equation modeling (GSEM) to identify genomic factors associated with ED and ANX phenotypes.

Additionally, we propose a fine-grained investigation of the association between ED and ANX by examining ED and ANX symptom trajectories across adolescence and into adulthood; to hone in on the biology that underlies ED and ANX change over time. At present, little is known about how ED and ANX symptoms affect each other across development, and how genetic risk influences their onset and course, though it is likely that genetic risk affects onset and course differently in adolescence vs. adulthood. Studying how ED and ANX are associated, both genetically and phenotypically, across development will advance early identification and targeted prevention and treatment of these conditions before threshold diagnoses crystallize.",important novel findings in risk for eating disorders,"Tuesday, 24 September, 2019","Wednesday, 25 September, 2019","Epidemiology, Eating disorders - anorexia, bulimia, GWAS, Development"

Yet, understanding these biological mechanisms will be critical for minimizing the costs of low SES for health as well as maximizing the benefits of high SES for health. This lack of clarity may reflect variations in the measurement of SES, a lack of recognition of factors that influence for whom the SES-health gradient will hold and, until recently, limited availability of epigenetic data. We contend that in order to clarify how SES might get into the body to influence health we should first, determine which indictor(s) of SES, and in which combinations, might work to influence biological mechanisms and second, we should consider whether there might be specific factors that influence for whom SES might get into the body to influence mental and physical health.

However, whilst there are indirect clues in support of this hypothesis, such as evidence for maternal line inheritance of asthma suggestive of imprinting, and data indicating transgenerational effects of grand-maternal smoking in pregnancy on asthma risk(2), direct evidence is currently lacking. We have found a positive association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and risk of asthma in ALSPAC and proposed that the underlying mechanism involves glutathione (GSH) depletion(3). This effect has become stronger for asthma at 91 months (odds ratio per category increase in paracetamol exposure 1.33 (95% CI: 1.15 to 1.54), P=0.000092), and the effect was modified by glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 genotype in the mother and child (odds ratio 3.63 (1.48 to 8.92), P=0.005 if mother homozygous wild (HW) for GSTM1; OR 5.01 (2.13 to 11.74), P=0.00021 if child HW).

Hence, understanding the determinants of puberty timing is an important topic. Children who show rapid weight gain during early life and are overweight or obese are more likely than others to progress through puberty early. However, there is scarce and inconsistent evidence regarding specific foods or nutrients associated with the timing of puberty (1).

A previous analysis of ALSPAC in 2010 (prior to available puberty questionnaire data) was limited to a categorical assessment of age at menarche only (2). That analysis found that higher total protein intakes at age 3 and 7 years were associated with higher likelihood of reaching menarche by age 12 years 8 months (2), but two other studies found no association between total protein intake and the timing of onset of puberty (1). Also, inconsistent associations between total fat, monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat intakes and puberty timing have been reported (1, 2). No association between total carbohydrate intake and puberty timing was found (1), nor in ALSPAC with specific carbohydrates (i.e. starch, sugar and fibre intakes) (2). In contrast, a recent study found that more frequent sugar-sweetened beverage intakes was associated with earlier menarche (1).

The present research will analyse diets in children at ages prior to the onset of puberty. In ALSPAC, these diets were assessed by parental report (food frequency questionnaire and diet diaries) and objective biomarkers of specific intakes (red cell membrane fatty acids, as markers of dairy fat, and fish and seafood intakes). The main outcome will be the timing of puberty development: onset, completion and duration of puberty.

Preschool wheezing is a heterogeneous group of diseases and various cohort studies (including ALSPAC) have proposed a number of phenotypes that differ in time-course, associated factors such as atopy and risk of asthma in later life [2].

The importance of identifying the phenotype in a wheezing child is apparent because of parental concern, treatment considerations, and long-term prognosis. A complex approach to a wheezy child is often needed and includes clinical course (including frequency and severity of individual episodes), family history of asthma and atopy, various biomarkers such as blood and nasal secretion eosinophils [3,4], total and specific IgE [5], exhaled fraction of nitric oxide [6], ICAM1 [7], and other exhaled breath condensate markers [8]. There are data that chronic obstructive diseases in adulthood, including asthma and COPD, start in childhood [9] and indeed the features of certain preschool wheezing phenotypes are similar to those of COPD [10].

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is the major genetic factor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [11]. More than three million people die each year due to COPD and about 90% of COPD-related deaths happen in low-income countries. It is the third most common condition to cause death in the United States [12]. More than 235 million people have asthma which is the most common chronic disease in childhood (WHO data, 2017; http://www.who.int/respiratory/en/). There is no curative treatment for COPD.

Since alpha-1 antitrypsin also exhibits numerous immunomodulatory functions and suppresses inflammatory response, all these features may play a role in the pathogenesis of preschool wheezing.

AAT’s primary function is inhibition of proteases but it has other functions apart from protease inhibition [13] and is involved in the inflammatory processes [14]. It has been noted that oxidative stress is of greater magnitude in children with variant AAT alleles [15] and the Pi*Z type has proinflammatory properties [16]. Protease inhibitors (including AAT) are thought to be involved in childhood asthma exacerbations [17]. It has also been suggested that COPD patients who are heterozygotes (MZ genotype) had experienced wheezing in early childhood but were symptom-free until late adulthood and developed COPD.

One hypothesised explanation is that the pharmacological effects of alcohol reduce cognitive capacity, and risk perception leading to an increased risk of committing a crime while under the influence of alcohol. We propose to examine the extent to which associations detected are causal using data collected at the ALSPAC focus clinic at age 24 years on committing crime while sober (which cannot be due to the situational effects of intoxication) and while under the influence of alcohol. We will examine the effects of alcohol consumption (prevalence, frequency, quantity) on violent and nonviolent crime, compare the association between drinking and engaging in crime while sober to the association between drinking and crime, and investigate whether cognitive factors (such as  impulsivity, poor working memory and poor emotion recognition) increase the risk of crime while under the influence of alcohol.","This research is for a dissertation project within the MSc Epidemiology. It will therefore result in an electronic poster to be presented at a student research symposium, a dissertation report and a published paper. A better understanding of the extent to which the association between alcohol consumption and crime is causal will improve prevention and intervention strategies for criminal behaviour in young people. Identifying cognitive factors that increase the risk of crimes being committed under the influence of alcohol will improve targeted invention strategies.","Thursday, 26 March, 2020","Friday, 27 March, 2020","Epidemiology, Addiction  - e.g. alcohol, illicit drugs, smoking, gambling, etc., Behaviour - e.g. antisocial behaviour, risk behaviour, etc., Cognitive impairment, Statistical methods, Cognition - cognitive function, Statistical methods"

Previously, affected individuals were thought to ""grow out"" of such disorders by adult life. However, we now know that is not correct. Longitudinal patient studies show that many manifest high symptom levels and impairment in adult life. However individual developmental trajectories are highly variable and symptom profiles change with maturation. Intriguingly, recent evidence suggests that some forms of adult ADHD emerge without being preceded by a similar childhood phenotype. These findings highlight the need to investigate the natural history of neurodevelopmental disorders into adulthood, in unselected population cohorts.

DNA methylation in peripheral blood is known to be associated with a variety of exposures (e.g. cigarette smoking) and traits (e.g. BMI).  We propose to determine if DNA methylation is associated with aggressive behavior to better understand the biological correlates of aggression and to evaluate the potential utility of aggression biomarkers in peripheral blood.,A publication presenting the best biomarkers from peripheral blood DNA methylation to date for aggression.
