 People with EDs will present to hospital needing medical attention for physical health complications that may be direct or indirect consequences of their EDs. CRIS provides a unique opportunity to determine the physical health problems that people with AN or BN face which causes them to be admitted to hospital. This then will enable comparison of the hospital use and physical illnesses of patients with AN and BN to the general population. This information can help to inform clinical practice on optimum pathways in the management of patients with EDs.
It is known that among all mental health conditions, AN has one of the highest rate of deaths. Using CRIS, the rate of deaths in people with EDs compared to that observed in the general population of the U.K can be determined. Furthermore, it is known that one of the main causes of death in people with EDs is suicide; however not much has been done to draw a general picture about how EDs lead to other health conditions and death in a broader context.
