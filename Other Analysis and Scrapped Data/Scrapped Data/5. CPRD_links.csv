1616634570-2705,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=0,Exploring the role of electronic Frailty Index (eFI) using routine primary care electronic health care records data to predict hospitalization and mortality in older patients with type 2 diabetes,"Older people with type 2 diabetes commonly have different levels of frailty associated with multiple medical problems and disabilities.  The risks and benefits for older patients from lowering their blood sugar levels to certain target values may be affected by their different frailty levels.  We aim to use an ""electronic frailty index"" (eFI) to test the feasibility of using eFI scores for individual older patients to determine for each the blood sugar target that optimally balances benefits and risks.
To do this, we will use data collected from GP surgeries nation-wide.  From this we shall extract relevant information for all patients above the age of 65 with type 2 diabetes.  We will calculate individual eFI scores for patients using data such as age, disability status or co-existing medical problems.  We will then look for associations between individual frailty scores and various outcomes: overall risks of death and of severe complications such as heart attacks or strokes, and some risks associated with intensive treatment, such as low blood sugars (hypoglycaemia), requiring hospital admissions.  Finally, we will investigate - separately for patients with different severities of diabetes (identified using sugar levels from the diabetes monitoring blood test) - associations between the same outcomes and different blood sugar targets.
Our intention is to provide evidence to support the use of eFI scores to help determine appropriately differentiated blood sugar targets for older patients with type-2 diabetes, which take into account the different risks and benefits for individuals.","The technical summary should provide a succinct overview of the overarching study aim and objectives, primary exposure(s), and outcome(s), if relevant, study design, and methods including the main statistical tests to be used.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an age related disease and the heterogeneity in older patients' health status represent a challenge to making generalised treatment recommendations for older adults. The recent development and validation of an electronic frailty index (eFI) now offers a tool which was supported in the 2016 UK NICE multimorbidity guidelines. In this study, our research question is: Can an eFI, generated from routinely collected data, be used to predict hospitalization and mortality at an individual level of older patients with T2D? 
Study design: an open cohort of patients 65 years and older, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, followed for two years or until all-cause hospitalisation or mortality.
Methods: Multivariate Cox regression analysis will be run to predict the outcome.  Model 1 will include social history, polypharmacy and the co-morbidity relevant to risk factor for hospitalization and mortality but not the eFI; Model 2 will be the same but will include the eFI.  Likelihood-ratio test will be used to assess the effect of adding the eFI to the model.  For both models, D statistics and Harrell's C statistics will be calculated as measures of discrimination.  The addition of the eFI will be considered an improvement if a reduction in Akaike's Information Criterion is greater than 4.
The analysis will be repeated for patients grouped by different levels of glycaemic control.  The groups will be formed by using quintiles of HbA1c at the study entry.
We believe findings from this study will form the basis for a wider, routine, evidence-based use of eFI when assessing and setting treatment targets for people with T2D, and will have a major impact on the quality of life of patients and in reducing the societal economic burden of treatments.",Composite of All-cause hospitalisation and All-cause mortality deriving from GP or HES data.,"Dr Iskandar Idris - Chief Investigator - University of Nottingham

Studies carried out previously have shown mixed results. Some studies have found there is an increased chance of developing heart disease, but other studies have found that only happens in people with asthma that smoke or only in people with asthma and allergies. Therefore it may be that different people with asthma have different risks. Another study found that people in Taiwan with a similar lung disease, called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, that had recently started an inhaled drug that is commonly used in asthma, had an increased risk of developing heart disease. Therefore, we wish to see in a UK population of people with asthma if some people have an increased risk of heart disease. Whether that increases their risk of developing heart disease, or diseases associated with heart problems, or it increases their risk of worse problems from having heart disease e.g. needing to be admitted to hospital or even dying from heart disease.","The annual incidence and mortality rates of cardiovascular disease and related diseases (ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, ischaemic stroke, arrhythmias, thromboembolic disease, obstructive sleep apnoea and diabetes) will be calculated for people with asthma. Outcomes will be determined using primary care (CPRD), hospital diagnoses (HES) and death certificate diagnoses (ONS). Incidence and mortality will be compared to a randomly selected cohort of CPRD patients, that do not have asthma. A multivariable Poisson model, adjusted for risk factors (gender, age, smoking history, body mass index, eosinophil count, asthma medications, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and socioeconomic status - using linkage with Index of Multiple Deprivation), will be used to obtain rate ratios. To determine cardiovascular risk from long-acting bronchodilators, a nested case-control will be used from a cohort of incident long-acting bronchodilator users. Exposure (long acting bronchodilator) will be categorised by type of inhaler and duration of use. The cases will matched 1:4 and conditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association. The same analysis will also be carried out in a COPD population.","Incidence and mortality rates of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), hypertension, heart failure (HF), ischaemic stroke, arrhythmia, thromboembolic disease, obstructive sleep apnoea and diabetes in asthma patients; incident ratios comparing to general population.

In many instances, AD begins in childhood, while severe cases may persist in adulthood.  About one-third of adult cases develop in adulthood. AD is one of the most common non-communicable skin diseases which affects up to 20% of children and 2-8% of adults in most countries of the world. There is limited data on the number of adults living with AD in Europe, but studies suggest rates between 4.4% and 7.1% and trends of increasing occurrence. The purpose of this study is to determine how many adult patients live with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis as per Jan 1, 2020 in the UK population, how the occurrence of the disease has developed within the past 5 years and to examine the number of other diseases that may co-exist with AD. These data are based on patients seen in primary care. Also, the study aims to characterise patients with moderate-to-severe AD by age, gender, body mass index, what treatment they receive for the skin condition and counts of referrals from general practitioners to specialist/hospital care. The public health benefit and importance of the study is emphasized by the lack of knowledge on how many adults currently live with moderate to severe AD in the UK. Estimating the proportion of adults living with AD and assessing their severity of disease will help understanding the burden of disease of AD in the UK and how it has developed in recent time.","The intention of this study is to provide reliable, current data on the prevalence and treatment patterns (topical and systemic treatment) of AD in the adult UK population. The study is cross-sectional, determining adult patients with AD in the CPRD by a validated algorithm combining diagnostic and treatment codes indicative for AD (index event) including historic data 2 years preceding the index event. The main outcome variables are counts and proportion of adult patients with AD including demographic data, comorbidities and treatment characteristics. The statistical analysis in the study is descriptive, using count and proportion of adult AD patients. The results are summarised as number (%) for categorical variables and mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables. No comparative analyses are performed.

1616634546-2694,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=0,Hormone replacement therapy and dementia risk: nested case-control studies using CPRD and QResearch,"Background: Dementia is a devastating condition with serious consequences for affected individuals, families, carers and wider society.  It is commonest in older people, affecting 1 in 14 over the age of 65.  In the UK, there are currently about 850,000 people living with dementia, and the number is expected to increase to over 1 million by 2025.
Some factors, such as smoking, alcohol and obesity, are known to increase risk of developing dementia, but there is a lack of information about factors which could delay or prevent its development.  If taken at around the time of the menopause, there is some evidence that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can reduce the risk of dementia in women, but studies investigating this have so far been conflicting and inconclusive.

Purpose of the study: To clarify whether HRT can reduce the risk of developing dementia or delay onset.

Potential importance of the findings: If HRT is found to reduce the risk of developing dementia, this will be a significant step forward for women considering using hormonal therapies for menopausal symptoms.  Concern about the prospect of dementia is growing, so a beneficial effect from hormonal treatments on development of dementia would be an important decision factor.","The technical summary should provide a succinct overview of the overarching study aim and objectives, primary exposure(s), and outcome(s), if relevant, study design, and methods including the main statistical tests to be used.

Objective:
The study will investigate risks of incident dementia associated with different types of HRT.

Outcome:
Incident dementia

Exposure:
Prescriptions for HRT

Methods:
This will be a nested case-control study. Cases will be women aged 55 years and over with incident dementia diagnosed between 1998 and 2019, matched with up to 5 controls by age, sex, practice and calendar year. Cases will be selected using GP, ONS mortality and HES data.

Analysis:
Exposure to different HRTs will be defined as at least one prescription for that HRT excluding three years before the index date (date of diagnosis of dementia or equivalent date in matched controls). Conditional logistic regression will be used to assess the risks associated with different types of oestrogen and progesterone.  The effects of duration, length of any gap since the last use, different application routes and the age at which treatment started will be analysed for the most common types of hormones.  All analyses will be adjusted by available data for potential confounding variables.
A study using this same protocol will also be carried out using data from another primary care database (QResearch).  Adjusted odds ratios from the conditional regression analyses of the two datasets will be pooled using a fixed effect model with inverse variance weights.","First record of diagnosis of dementia in general practice, hospital admission data and ONS Mortality data, or treatment for dementia in general practice.","Dr Yana Vinogradova - Chief Investigator - University of Nottingham

This has resulted in an increase in the number of measles cases, leading the World Health Organization to withdraw the UK's measles elimination status in 2019.  The reasons for the decline in MMR uptake are unclear.  Public Health England publishes figures on regional variation and the National Audit Office publishes rates by area socioeconomic deprivation (a measure of the level of poverty in an area).  But no information is available on rates by other area based measures nor by maternal characteristics such as age, ethnicity, or the number of children a mother has.  NHS England and Public Health England have identified several contributing factors, including problems with access, anti-vaccination messages, and parental vaccine hesitancy.  The objective of this study is to explore individual and area level factors associated with likelihood of MMR immunisation, and furthermore to establish whether the main reasons for low vaccine uptake are limited access (i.e. GP practice/regional level variation) or individual differences in vaccine acceptance (i.e. variation at the maternal level).  The expected public health benefit of this research is the ability to target areas or groups of mothers with low access, or mothers with characteristics associated with lower acceptance, with the ultimate aim of increasing MMR uptake.","This study aims to explore potential predictors of low MMR vaccine uptake.  Predictors fit broadly into three categories: area level exposures; maternal characteristics; and pregnancy history/current pregnancy factors.  The CPRD Gold data will be used to establish a cohort of women in the pregnancy register whose pregnancies resulted in live births. Area-based socioeconomic status will be assessed based on the linked small-area data (English Index of Multiple Deprivation).  Practice (including Up To Standard date), region, urban/rural classification, mother's age, ethnicity, religion, number of children attached to the mother, parity, number of miscarriages, previous infant deaths, child's gender, pre(eclampsia), pregnancy hypertension, gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, and maternal history of anxiety or depression will be extracted from the primary care data.   The outcome variables will be MMR1 at 24 months, MMR1 at 5 years, and MMR2 at 5 years.  Vaccinated and unvaccinated children will be compared on predictor variables univariately, using two sample t-tests for quantitative variables and chi-square analysis for qualitative variables.

Experts look at clinical studies to decide if antidiabetic drugs are effective. However, patients enrolled in these clinical studies may not be similar to individuals who are likely to receive the drug in the real-world. Determining how similar the patients in the clinical studies are to such likely drug users is important to decide if the study results are useful. However, it is unclear who are the ideal group of likely drug users. Using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we will identify three groups of likely drug users and examine their similarity with the individuals enrolled in the clinical studies. This study will help experts to find out which group of likely drug users best help determine the real-world usefulness of clinical studies.","Cardiovascular outcome randomized controlled trials (CVOTs) are conducted among patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular outcomes to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of antidiabetic drugs. However, type 2 diabetes is a heterogenous disease, and multiple clinically relevant subgroups remain underrepresented in these trials. This has resulted in regulatory concerns regarding the applicability of the safety results from the CVOT in the larger population of patients with type 2 diabetes. Simultaneously, this has resulted in a limited incorporation of the trial results in clinical guidelines, as the trials are unable to provide guidance for patients who are not at a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, examining the representativeness of CVOTs to wider populations of drug users in diabetes is of critical importance. To this end, using the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial of liraglutide as an illustrative example, we will examine its representativeness based on three different target populations: all patients with type 2 diabetes, liraglutide users, and liraglutide candidates. Liraglutide candidates are a target population comprising of individuals who are eligible to receive liraglutide according to treatment guidelines. Using the CPRD, we will identify these three target populations. We will then apply the eligibility criteria of the LEADER trial on each target population and determine the percentage of individuals in the target who would be eligible to be included in the LEADER trial. We will use a logistic regression model to calculate the propensity score distance between the entire target population and the individuals within the target who are eligible for the LEADER trial. Together, this study will determine the ideal target populations and the appropriate measures to be used while determining the representativeness of CVOTs.",Percent eligible in the target population after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the LEADER trial.,"Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

As the disease progress, patients often require treatment with two types of insulin products known as rapid- and long-acting insulin, respectively. Patients treated with rapid- and long-acting insulins experience a large burden having to administer three to four injections per day. Not all patients with T2DM are able or willing to cope with the complexity of an intensive treatment like this and are therefore switched to a more convenient product known as premix insulin. Premixed insulin is a combination of rapid- and long-acting insulin offering the convenience of only twice daily insulin injections, while avoiding administration errors inherent in mixing separate insulins or giving multiple separate injections. Biphasic Insulin Aspart 30/70 (BIAsp 30) is a type of premixed insulin. There is limited data on clinical characteristics and blood sugar levels in patients switching to BIAsp 30 in clinical practise. We propose to study blood sugar control in patients prescribed BIAsp 30 by their general practitioner in the UK. By using routinely collected health information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) we will determine T2DM patients treated with multiple daily insulin injections switching to BIAsp 30 and examine blood sugar levels before and after switching. Furthermore, we will investigate clinical characteristics. The study will help fill in the knowledge gap about clinical characteristics and blood sugar levels in patients switching to BIAsp 30 in real world clinical practise.","Premixed insulins offer the convenience of fewer daily injections and better adherence in T2DM patients requiring both fast- and long-acting insulin treatment. Clinical trials have found the treatment effect to be comparable to basal-bolus treatment, however little is known about glycaemic control in patients switching from basal-bolus treatment to Biphasic Insulin Aspart 30/70 (BIAsp 30) in the real world. This study aims to investigate glycaemic control and other clinical characteristics in T2DM patients switching from basal-bolus treatment to BIAsp 30 in a population-based study in the UK. Data will be extracted from the CPRD database allowing for an analysis of the effect of switching to BIAsp 30 in a real-world setting. BIAsp 30 naiive patients will be followed after switching from basal-bolus treatment and their change in HbA1c will be analysed using a mixed model of repeated measures (MMRM). Treatment adherence will be evaluated by analysing the time until discontinuation.

In the UK, infant mortality had been decreasing continuously over 100 years until 2015. From 2015 to 2017, a gradual increase has been observed and was hypothesised to be due to increased deprivation. It is known that babies born to socially/economically deprived parents (or parents living in deprived areas) have a higher likelihood of dying. Previous reports also found that the difference in infant mortality due to deprivation has not been narrowed from 1950 to 2018. However, it is important to see whether the trend is robust after considering other potential explanations. It is also important to understand how deprivation may influence infant mortality. Some hypotheses are parental age at delivery, maternal illnesses, smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and pregnancy complications. This study will verify any socioeconomic disparity in infant mortality and the whether such disparity can be explained by maternal and pregnancy factors. While upstreaming factors for health disparity (such as deprivation) is harder and takes a longer time to improve, maternal and pregnancy factors can be changed through healthcare services in the exisiting framework. This study will contribute to the reduction of socioeconomic disparity in infant mortality through modifying the intermediate factors.","This study aims to study whether the socioeconomic disparity in infant mortality (under 1 year) has widened, narrowed, or remained stable and whether this can be explained by potential mediators: maternal age and ethnicity, smoking and drinking during pregnancy, maternal illnesses, and pregnancy complications using the CPRD Gold data. A cohort of pregnant women in the CPRD pregnancy register will be established. Stillbirths will be excluded. Deaths of their children will be ascertained through the linkage to the ONS death registration. Area-based socioeconomic status (relative deprivation) will be assessed based on the linked small-area data (twentiles of English Index of Multiple Deprivation). Child sex, year of birth, maternal age at delivery, any pregnancy complications and birth characteristics (gestational diabetes, pregnancy hypertension, (pre-)eclampsia, preterm labour, mode of delivery, and maternal prior history of mental disorders (depression and anxiety), disability, and cancer will be extracted from the primary care data. Poisson regression with robust standard errors will be used to study the trend of socioeconomic disparity. Infant all-cause death will be the outcome variable. Child sex, year of delivery, area-based deprivation, and the interaction between year of delivery and deprivation will be the predictors. Interaction tests will be used to indicate any changes in disparity. The same model will be replicated with potential mediators as additional covariates. The percentage decrease in the effect size of the interaction terms indicates the role of the mediators. As sensitivity analysis, the above primary analysis will be replicated with: 1. Generalised additive model for potential nonlinear trend; 3. Neonatal (0-27 days) and post-neonatal (28-365 days) death as outcomes; and 4.

For patients with long-term medical conditions this is even harder, particularly if their conditions share symptoms with cancer. For example, people with chronic chest disease will often be short of breath and have a cough, which are also symptoms of lung cancer. 
We will be developing new methods to find out if cancer diagnosis is significantly delayed in people with multiple health conditions. New methods are needed, because existing ones use the patient's first cancer symptom recorded in the medical notes. It is impossible to know if that symptom was from the cancer or the existing health condition
We will study 3,000 people (cases) with cancer of the stomach or food gullet, and 3,000 people who do not have cancer (controls). Cases and controls will be paired on age, sex, their general practice, and their health burden. We will then divide our 6,000 patients into groups by their health burden. We will study three groups of different health burden: (1) low (no or only a few long-term conditions); (2) medium; and (3) high (many long-term health conditions). 
We will identify ""normal"" patterns for visiting the doctor in the two years before the case was diagnosed with cancer. From this, we will see when people start to visit their doctor more often than normal because of the undiagnosed cancer. We will develop a method for comparing this ""pick-up"" point in visits between the three groups, to test if it varies for patients with different health burdens.","This matched, retrospective cohort study will be set in primary care, using observational data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We will study patients with CPRD diagnostic codes for oesophageal or stomach cancer recorded between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019. To quantify baseline consultation rates, we will include controls (1:1) to cases on age, sex, general practice and multimorbidity burden. Multimorbidity is defined as two or more coexisting chronic conditions, and multimorbidity burden as the overall impact of different diseases in an individual, taking their severity into account. 
We will develop methodology, based on time series and negative binomial/Poisson regression, to explore how the timeliness of cancer diagnosis varies between groups of patients with different multimorbidity burden. Previous work using such techniques has concentrated on the point at which the difference between consultation rates in cases and controls becomes statistically significant. This potentially introduces a bias, whose magnitude depends on sample size. Here we will build on preliminary work being done in partnership between Gary Abel and the UCL CanTest team to estimate the most likely inflection point and the uncertainty on that. Outcomes to be measured include:
1. Rates of face-to-face consultations between general practitioners and cases or matched controls in the 2 years before the case is diagnosed with cancer. 
2. The time at which population-level consultation rate starts to increase before a diagnosis of cancer, across patient groups with different multimorbidity burden.
Simulation suggests that 3,000 cases and 3,000 matched controls will give us 92% power to detect a 9% difference in monthly consultation rate between groups with differing multimorbidity burden.","1.

1616634548-2695,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=0,The prevalent new-user design for cohort studies with no active comparator: The example of statins and cancer,"Statins are drugs effective at lowering cholesterol and they are used in the prevention of heart attack and stroke. In addition to their favourable effect in cardiovascular diseases, some observational studies also suggested that statins might reduce the risk of developing cancer. However, it was shown that methodological problems in the design and analysis of some of these studies led to the apparent beneficial effect of statins on cancer. The challenges of comparing a treated group to untreated patients in observational studies are numerous and careful assessment of several aspects, both at the design stage and in the analysis, must be taken into account. Indeed, the complexity of studies involving the comparison of a treated group to a untreated group reside, in part, in the absence of a clear starting point in time to base the comparison for people not using the drug of interest.

We propose an approach, which provides an emulation of the classical randomized trial to compare new users of the drug under study with non-users. We illustrate this approach by assessing the effect of statin use compared with non-use on the incidence of cancer.","The new-user cohort design is an essential tool for the conduct of observational studies of the comparative effects of drugs, including effectiveness and safety, to capture potential early effects and to properly time the confounders. While this approach is commonplace, a certain level of complexity is introduced when the comparison is not against an active comparator but rather against non-use. In this context, immortal time and other time-related bias become important threats to the validity of results. The objective of this study is to describe how the prevalent new-user design can be used in this context and to illustrate its use with the example of assessing the effect of statin use compared to non-use on the incidence of cancer. We will form a cohort of all adults in the CPRD, 30 years of age or more between January 1998 and December 2015, having at least one year of up-to-standard data and the record of a LDL cholesterol level <5 mmol/L. For each statin user, we will use the prevalent new-user design to select a reference statin non-user at the same time point as the user, matched on sex and time conditional propensity scores. Matched subjects will be followed for up to 10 years or until the occurrence of a cancer. The Cox proportional hazard model will be used to perform an intention to treat analysis that assesses the effect of statin use versus non-use on the risk of cancer occurrence.","Overall cancer; 7 site-specific cancers: breast, colorectal, haematological, melanoma, non-small cell lung, prostate and urothelial.","Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

These sensations prompt us to move, so avoiding poor blood flow which can lead to pressure ulcers. Pressure ulcers mainly affect older people confined to a bed or chair. However, younger or seriously ill patients with limited movement can be affected. Pressure ulcers range in severity from red skin to deep wounds through muscle to bone. Pressure ulcers have a major impact on quality of life; they may heal slowly, become infected and can increase the risk of dying in older people. They are also a costly problem for the National Health Service (NHS). 

Common treatments for pressure ulcers include pressure relief, dressings and encouraging change of position. Surgery can be used to try and close deep pressure ulcers but in the United Kingdom this treatment is not common. It is not currently clear which patients with pressure ulcers may benefit from an operation and which of the different ways of doing the surgery seems best.

This study will analyse data collected routinely in the NHS about people who developed a pressure ulcer during the last 11 years. The study will describe the care that has been provided to these patients, the number of ulcers progressing to severe status, the kinds of patients who have been treated in different ways and examine how care is different in different places. It will also compare health outcomes in patients who did and did not have surgery.","There is little evidence about the effectiveness of surgical interventions for stage III and IV pressure ulcers. This retrospective cohort study is part of the SIPS study, which aims to define the parameters required for a randomised controlled trial of surgery for this indication.

The study will request data for patients with an index record indicating a pressure ulcer during a period of 11 years, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) records and mortality records. We expect the cohort to comprise over 75,000 pressure ulcers, using Read and SNOMED codes to ascertain eligible patients with incident ulcers.

This cohort will be used to assess usual care provided to patients, including but not limited to referrals within primary care, dressings, provision of pressure relief equipment and negative wound pressure therapy.

The objective is to describe the patients with incident severe pressure ulcers and their care pathways across primary and secondary care, e.g. management in the community, management by tissue viability nurses, admission to hospital and subsequent care.

The outcomes described will be: 
1. frequencies of specific Read and SNOMED codes; 
2. referral to and discharge from community/district nursing team; 
3. referral to tissue viability services; 
4. admission to hospital with a pressure ulcer diagnosis, and duration of admissions; 
5. admission to hospital for surgical reconstruction of a pressure ulcer; 
6. mortality. 

Mortality is an important outcome as pressure ulcers increase the risk of dying in older people. Outcome frequencies will be estimated precisely, given the large sample size. A small number of patients who have hospital admissions will be tracked through linkage with HES data.

These findings will contribute to a formal consensus process to define the populations that may benefit from reconstructive surgery, the operations that should be considered and what should constitute usual care.","1. Frequencies of activities (indicated by Read or SNOMED codes) reflecting management of pressure ulcers; 
2. Referral to and discharge from community/district nursing team, generating periods of community nursing care and durations; 
3. Referral to tissue viability services; 
4. Admission to hospital with a pressure ulcer diagnosis, and duration of admissions related to a pressure ulcer; 
5. Admission to hospital for surgical reconstruction of a pressure ulcer;

An important cause of increased morbidity in diabetes is higher occurrence of cancer among patients with diabetes. However, whether the occurrence of cancer in diabetes has changed over time is unclear. This is concerning because the occurrence of cancer has increased over the last several decades, with substantial costs to the health system, particularly when diagnosed at late stages. The current study will use the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink to investigate whether the occurrence of cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes compared with non-diabetic individuals has changed over time. Knowledge derived from this study might enable health authorities to screen for cancer among patients with diabetes, in the process diagnosing such cancer early and managing it more effectively.","Epidemiological studies have established the association between diabetes and the risk of cancer. Various factors that might influence the incidence of cancer in diabetes have altered over time. They include the introduction of novel antidiabetic drugs and longer survival of patients with diabetes. Whether the incidence of cancer in patients with diabetes has varied over time is unclear. This study will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to assemble patients at least 40 years of age newly-treated for type 2 diabetes between 1988 and 2018. These patients with type 2 diabetes will be matched with non-diabetic individuals using risk set sampling. Poisson regression models conditional on matched pairs will be used to estimate incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals comparing the incidence rates of cancer overall and site-specific cancer, separately, between patients with type 2 diabetes and individuals from the non-diabetic population for each year between 1988 and 2018. Secondary analyses will stratify the incidence by age and sex and examine the effect of duration of diabetes.","Cancer overall and site-specific cancer (cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, colon and rectal, kidney, head and neck, central nervous system, pancreas, bladder, endometrium, oesophagus, ovary, stomach, liver and biliary tract, and thyroid, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia, and myeloma).","Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

1616634559-2700,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=0,Determining the applicability and feasibility of using regression discontinuity in electronic health record data,"This study focuses on an analysis method - called regression discontinuity or ""RD"" - that aims to determine whether patients profit from a given treatment. While clinical trials (that is, a study where patients are randomly assigned to receive a treatment or not, often under highly controlled conditions) are considered to be the method of choice to test for effective treatment, they may not fully capture real-life effects occurring during routine care. Moreover, many clinical trials lack the long-run perspective necessary to evaluate treatments. RD achieves this by exploiting thresholds (cut-offs) in variables that influence whether someone receives a treatment or not (e.g., blood pressure above 160/100 mmHg). By ""zooming in"" around the threshold, it can be assumed that people just above and just below the threshold are similar to each other and can, thus, be compared in the same fashion as treated and untreated patients in a clinical trial. The method could potentially be applied widely in clinical medicine because clinical decisions are frequently at least partially based on such thresholds. RD, however, has thus far not been used in electronic health record data. The objective of this study is to determine to what degree RD can be applied in electronic health record data. If we are able to show that the method is feasible for a wide variety of variables and thresholds used in clinical medicine, then RD could be used to study of the effectiveness of clinical interventions in routine care (as opposed to research settings).","Regression discontinuity (RD) design - a quasi-experimental method taking advantage of decision rules that assign patients to a clinical intervention if they fall above/below an arbitrary cut-off point - has potential to assess causal effects of clinical interventions. This study seeks to determine the applicability and feasibility of RD in electronic health record data. Specifically, we aim to (1) determine which (if any) laboratory or physical measurements contain thresholds that are associated with a substantial change in the probability of receiving a clinical intervention, (2) evaluate if patient characteristics are balanced within a small bandwidth surrounding these thresholds, and (3) investigate whether associations between the clinical intervention and patient outcomes are robust to different choices of bandwidth around the threshold. Exposure variables include laboratory and physical measurements such as BMI, blood pressure, HbA1c, blood glucose, age, low-density lipoprotein, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, hemoglobin, and T-score and Z-score for bone mineral density. Patient outcomes primarily include future measurements of the exposure variables, mortality (overall and by cause of death, such as due to cardiovascular disease when examining the effects of statins), and hospitalization (overall and by cause of admission). We will estimate ""fuzzy"" RD models using local linear regression to avoid overfitting data and triangular weights to give more influence to observations close to the threshold. In addition, we will use a mean squared error (MSE) optimal bandwidth that is empirically derived. We assess the sensitivity of the results using alternative bandwidths (e.g. bandwidths that are 50%, 75%, 125%, and 150% of the empirically derived mean squared error-optimal bandwidth). If feasible and widely applicable, RD analyses in electronic health records could generate valuable insights into the real-life effects of clinical interventions on health and health care use, the unintended effects associated with these interventions, and the potential heterogenous treatment effects by detailed patient subgroups.","The primary outcomes that we will measure are: future measurements of the exposure variables (e.g. BMI, blood pressure, HbA1c, blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, hemoglobin, and T-score and Z-score for bone mineral density), mortality (overall and by cause of death, such as due to cardiovascular disease when examining the effects of statins), and hospitalization (overall and by cause of admission).","Professor Till Barnighausen - Chief Investigator - University of Heidelberg

1616634553-2697,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=0,Antibiotic prescribing and risk of herpes zoster: a case-control study,"Both bacteria and viruses are extremely common throughout the human body. These colonies are collectively known as the microbiome. The microbiome is particularly large in the human gut but is also present elsewhere, in the nose/back of the mouth, the lungs, the skin, etc. A 'healthy microbiome' is believed to be important for human health. In previous research we have tried to assess whether antibiotics, given against a bacterial infection, damage the microbiome so resulting in higher risk of other diseases. We have shown increased risk for meningitis, rheumatoid arthritis and colorectal cancer following antibiotic consumption, often years earlier. 

Antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not viruses. Yet one of our earlier findings was that prior antibiotics increased the risk for both bacterial and viral meningitis. The mechanism is unclear but possibly linked to the ecological relationships between bacteria and viruses in the human microbiome. We would like to examine this effect further by investigating whether taking antibiotics triggers shingles, a viral infection caused by reactivation of chickenpox virus that has lain dormant in the body usually from childhood. If there is a relationship, we would later like to investigate whether a 'damaged microbiome' caused by previous antibiotic consumption increases vulnerability to other viruses, in particular covid-19.","Antibiotics, given to combat a specific infection, may produce collateral damage to the microbiome. This effect may be important as a 'healthy microbiome' seems to be implicated in its host's health. Our group has been investigating this phenomenon in a series of case control studies using primary care data. In these studies we have shown that prior antibiotics increased the risk of bacterial meningitis, we hypothesise by damaging the nasopharyngeal microbiome in which meningitis organisms are often commensals; we have also shown increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis, we hypothesise by interfering with the immune response that is known to be an important function of the gut microbiome; and we have shown an increased risk of colorectal cancer, we hypothesise through damage to the protective effect of gut bacteria. One of the surprising findings in these studies was that prior antibiotics increased the risk of viral meningitis just as much as bacterial meningitis. Antibiotics have no direct effect on viruses so we surmise that change in the bacterial microbiome results in changes in the viral microbiome whether through affecting some immune response or by other ecological mechanisms. We would now like to investigate further this (indirect) relationship of antibiotics to the viral microbiome by seeing whether prior antibiotics increase the risk of reactivating herpes zoster. We therefore propose carrying out a case control study, comparing the antibiotic history of patients with herpes zoster with a control group without the disease. If there is an effect, it may have an important bearing on vulnerability to other viral infections such as covid-19.",The main outcome measure of the study is shingles/herpes zoster.

1616634579-2709,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=0,CORYLUS UK: A retrospective observational cohort study of the impact of COVID-19 on systemic lupus erythematosus patients in England using data from linked primary and secondary care databases,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complicated and chronic autoimmune disease where a patient’s own immune system can attack any part of their body. SLE has a huge range of symptoms from rash and hair loss, through to heart disease and serious brain and nerve problems from constant immune activity. Commonly prescribed medications include steroids and immunosuppressants that leave patients in an immunocompromised state, depending on the severity of their disease and medication dosage.
Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic there is a need to understand how it has affected SLE patients. Because of their treatment regimens, they may be more at risk of catching COVID-19 because of their immunocompromised state. However, the medications for SLE are also commonly used to treat COVID-19, so any infection might be less severe as a result.
This study will examine the impact that COVID-19 amongst patients with SLE in England, grouped according to how severe their SLE is. These patient groups will be described by their demographic and clinical profiles, along with determining their rate of healthcare resource use. Understanding the rate of COVID-19 infections in SLE patients, and the severity of their infections will be useful for informing policy and patient management.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by autoantibodies, systemic inflammation and lymphopenia. There is no cure for SLE, and treatment depends on severity, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and antimalarial agents such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Whilst corticosteroids are rapidly effective for suppressing flares, long term use has considerable side-effects[1].
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on patient care for those living with chronic diseases, including lower healthcare-seeking behaviour, and shielding for severely immunocompromised patients to lower their risk of exposure to the virus. However, with similar treatment regimens for SLE and COVID-19 considered, it is unknown whether SLE patients are at a greater or lower risk of severe COVID-19 infections.
This descriptive retrospective observational cohort study aims to investigate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had upon SLE patients, stratified according to the severity of their autoimmune disease. The demographic and clinical profiles of SLE patients will be described, stratified by severity of SLE and COVID-19 status. SLE severity will be determined using an algorithm that incorporates comorbid conditions and medications prescribed within the twelve months prior to the study period. Among SLE patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 within the study period, metrics for mortality, admissions and lengths of stay will be calculated, stratified by severity of COVID-19.
This description of healthcare resource use will provide insight into whether the incidence rates of COVID-19 amongst SLE patients are higher or lower than published incidences amongst the general population, and whether patients with more severe SLE have experienced worse COVID-19 specific outcomes and mortality rates. This information can be used to inform policy and improve patient management for SLE patients who may be exposed to COVID-19.","The number of patients in each SLE sub-cohort; The total number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infections per calendar month amongst these sub-cohorts, stratified by COVID-19 severity; Demographic profiles for each sub-cohort (Mean, median, minimum, and maximum age at SLE diagnosis, gender, ethnicity, BMI, total time in cohort, mean and median follow-up time, Charlson Co-morbidity Score); Clinical profiles of SLE patients at entry into the observation period (Recorded prescriptions in primary care for corticosteroids, other steroids, immunosuppressive agents: azathioprine, cyclosporin, methotrexate, mycophenelate, and hydroxychloroquine or other antimalarial; number and percentage of patients with a record in HES relating to high cost biologics, Number and percentage of patients with comorbidities of interest (diabetes, hypertension, history of pneumonia, arterial/venous thrombosis, haemolytic anaemia, end-stage renal disease or dialysis, nephritis, history of myocardial infarction, history of stroke, obesity, hypercholesterolemia); mean, median, minimum, and maximum age of SLE patients at COVID-19 diagnosis; acute case fatality rate of COVID-19; COVID-specific admission rate and lengths of stay; all-cause admission rates and lengths of stay between COVID-19 severity groups, including those without a COVID-19 diagnosis; COVID-19 clinical outcomes and therapies in secondary care (respiratory distress, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, organ failure, pneumonia","John Were - Chief Investigator - Health IQ

As the disease progress, patients often require treatment with insulin to control blood sugar levels, which in turn minimises the risk of long-term complications, but is associated with increased risk of low blood sugar levels. Insulin detemir has proved to be safe and effective in reducing blood sugar levels in T2DM patients. However, there is limited evidence as to the effect of insulin detemir in specific T2DM populations such as the elderly and patients suffering from comorbidities such as cardiovascular, kidney, or liver disease. We propose to study blood sugar control in T2DM first-time users of insulin detemir that are elderly or suffering from comorbidities. This will be evaluated using the health information data collected from CPRD of first time insulin detemir users belonging to the above mentioned patient groups. By using routinely collected health information the change in blood glucose levels can be investigated in patients prescribed insulin detemir for the first time by their general practitioner in the United Kingdom. The study will provide insights to the knowledge gap about the effect of insulin detemir on controlling blood sugar levels and the occurrence of low blood sugar levels in elderly patients and with patients with multimorbidity in a real world setting.","This study aims to describe the change in HbA1c levels in T2DM patient groups such as elderly (>/=65) and patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular, renal, or liver disease, after initiating insulin detemir. Furthermore, we will investigate the occurrence of hypoglycaemic events, change in the number of oral glucose lowering drugs used, and the adherence to insulin detemir among these patient groups. Insulin detemir has shown to be effective in controlling glycaemic levels in patients with T2DM. However, limited evidence is available describing the use in T2DM elderly patients and patients suffering from comorbidities such as cardiovascular/renal/hepatic impairment in a real-world setting. The study will use a retrospective cohort design, with first-time use of insulin detemir as index, to assess glycaemic control based on HbA1c prior to index and during a 12-month post-index follow-up period. Mixed model of repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to evaluate mean Hb1Ac levels from baseline to end of follow-up. The risk of hypoglycaemia will be evaluated based on number of events from index to 12-month follow-up and analysed using a negative binomial model.

It is defined as an excess of body weight and is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancers, psychological problems such as depression, and mortality. The Coronavirus lockdown in the UK may mean that people see change in their BMI, move or exercise less frequently, use healthcare less often, and may be at increased risk of experiencing diseases associated with obesity or mental health issues.

The overall objective of this study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on People with Obesity (PwO), People with Overweight (PwOv) and people with neither obesity nor overweight (Pw/out). We will investigate change in body mass during lockdown, and people’s use of healthcare resources such as visiting healthcare professionals, taking medications during the COVID-19 pandemic and occurrence of mental health issues in these groups during lockdown.","Obesity is a significant public health problem across the UK. Defined as an excess of body weight, whether overweight (body mass index (BMI): 25-29) or obese (BMI≥30), it is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancers, psychological problems such as depression and anxiety, and mortality. The Coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2 virus), resulted in several stages of lockdown in the UK in order to disease reduce transmission, which may mean that people have seen a change in their BMI, experienced reduced activity, use healthcare resources more sparingly, and may be at increased risk of experiencing mental health issues associated with overweight or obese.

The overall objective of this study is to use Hospital Episode Statistic (HES)-linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on People with Obesity (PwO), People with Overweight (PwOv) and people with neither obesity nor overweight (Pw/out). We will investigate change in BMI/weight, use of healthcare resources, such as contact with healthcare professionals, adherence to medications, and incidence, recurrence and exacerbation of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 lockdown, amongst these populations. Means and standard deviations will be produced to describe changes, and generalised linear models (GLM) for repeated measures will be used to investigate changes in BMI/weight during lockdown (23rd March 2020 - present) relative to baseline (22nd March 2017 – 22nd March 2020 - BMI may be imputed within this period), and investigate effect modification by obesity level.

Concerns have emerged that SSRIs may increase the risk of high blood sugar levels and cause type 2 diabetes. However, whether the risk of diabetes varies between individual SSRIs is unclear. Indeed, individual SSRI drugs have different mechanisms of action that may affect weight gain and blood sugar levels. Thus, SSRIs with a stronger effect on weight and blood sugar levels may be associated with a higher risk of diabetes. This study will use the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink to assess whether the use of SSRIs with stronger effects on weight gain and blood sugar levels increase the risk of diabetes compared with SSRIs with a weak effect. Given the serious, long-lasting consequences of diabetes in children and youths, this study will provide information on the differences between SSRIs to inform treatment choice when prescribing an SSRI.","SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in children and youths in the United Kingdom. A steady increase in the rate of SSRIs prescriptions has been observed in the last two decades in this population. However, several studies in adults and one study in children and youths suggest that SSRIs may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While these studies evaluated the risk of T2DM associated with SSRIs as a class, whether differences exist between individual SSRIs is unclear. Indeed, individual SSRIs have different pharmacodynamic mechanisms, which may in turn induce different glycaemic and metabolic effects. The main mechanism of action of SSRIs involves the serotonin transporter, but affinity to other receptors with metabolic effects varies amongst SSRIs. Thus, SSRIs with higher binding affinity to these receptors may be associated with a higher risk for T2DM. We will conduct a cohort study to assess whether the use of SSRIs with strong binding affinity is associated with an increased risk for T2DM compared with use of SSRIs with weak binding affinity. The cohort will comprise all patients aged 5 to 24 years with a first prescription for an SSRI between 1990 and 2019. We will use Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratios of T2DM associated with the use of SSRIs with strong binding affinity compared with SSRIs with weak binding affinity. Secondary analysis will explore whether the risk varies with duration of use. We will also conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our results.",Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).,"Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

AF treatment include oral anticoagulants, which prevent blood clots, the main driver of the associated stroke risk.  Traditionally warfarin was mainly used however it requires careful dosage adjustment and regular blood tests to be used safely. Novel antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOACs) are easier to use and have been shown in clinical trials to not only reduce stroke risk in AF patients but also have a lower tendency to cause major bleeding compared to warfarin.

In the UK, a quarter of acute vascular events (the majority strokes) are AF-related incurring considerable human and healthcare costs.

AF treatment includes oral anticoagulation, preventing blood clotting, the main driver of the associated stroke risk.  Warfarin, the first line, requires careful dosage adjustment and regular blood tests to be used safely. Novel antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOACs) are easier to use and, in clinical trials, reduce stroke risk in AF patients and cause less major bleeding than warfarin.  Head-to-head efficacy and safety comparisons between the NOACs and warfarin using observational data have been made, though none from the UK. 

Four distinct NOAC drugs available in the UK, the newest of which was introduced between 2008 and 2015.  The study will make new-user comparisons between the newest, edoxaban, and each of the other alternative treatments, including warfarin by selecting propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts among anti-coagulant naive patients with AF.

This study will determine the comparative effectiveness of each NOAC versus warfarin in routine UK clinical practice.  Specifically, the study will assess whether in newly-treated patients and compared to warfarin, the use of each NOAC is associated with: 1) the rate of major bleeding (the primary outcome of interest), strokes, mortality; 2) treatment adherence and persistence; and 4) lower overall healthcare resource use and costs.

Time-to-event analyses will use Cox proportional hazards regression, with censoring defined by either treatment switching, non-outcome related death, practice de-registration or database horizon.  Generalized linear models will be constructed using the PS-matched cohorts to compare HCRU (Poisson/binomial) and cost (gamma) between treatments.

For example, their immune system compromises their ability to fight respiratory infections. This might also be true for viral infections, but there is no literature that addresses this question. Our study proposes to establish if people with DS are affected more commonly than their peers from the general population or with Intellectual disabilities with viral respiratory infections and /or COVID-19 diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify specific risk factors based on co-occurring conditions for infections and poor outcomes, as well as to determine whether disease progression is associated with these pre-existing conditions. We will also study whether they experience different access to different treatments, and if response to treatments differ in individuals with Down syndrome. By studying people with Down Syndrome, a condition with genetic risk for particular health conditions including viral infections such as COVID-19, we can inform strategies and interventions to help improve outcomes in these individuals such as whether “sheltering” is advisable during such pandemics, and if there are inequalities in care that need to be addressed.","Our overarching hypothesis is that DS individuals may be more vulnerable to developing COVID-19 which is not solely explained by co-occurrence of intellectual disability, and that they may also have worse outcomes following infection.

Objectives:

We will include individuals with Down syndrome in the CPRD datasets (GOLD, and Aurum) and 1) define their typical seasonal incidence for influenza/ flu and respiratory infection diagnosis and cause-specific as well as all-cause mortality rates to generate expected rates, 2) describe excess flu-like and respiratory infections and mortality as well as suspected, clinically-diagnosed or confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with their peers with intellectual disabilities and general population, 3) explore and compare factors associated with excess infections during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 4) compare the treatment/ interventions offered and associated outcomes (e.g. hospitalisation/ death/ discharge/ recovery) and factors associated with poor outcome for those diagnosed with COVID-19.

Methods:

We will select a cohort of individuals with DS from CPRD and conduct an interrupted time series analysis, of individuals with Down syndrome compared to individuals from the general population, and those who have intellectual disabilities but not Down syndrome, to explore influenza/ seasonal flu, respiratory infection and COVID-19 diagnoses as well as mortality.","Flu-like illness/ influenza, respiratory infections, COVID-19 suspected or confirmed diagnosis, cause-specific and all-cause mortality rates","Andre Strydom - Chief Investigator - King’s College London

1616634512-2680,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=1,Risk factors for and long-term outcomes in people with covid-19 admitted to hospital in England,"Covid-19 has rapidly spread across the world with many more cases and fatalities than in previous coronavirus outbreaks. Although most people with covid-19 experience a mild/moderate self-limiting disease, it has been estimated that some 20% of covid-19 infections detected are admitted to hospital and that 1 in 4 of those hospitalised will have a severe illness that needs intensive care and/or results in death. Current evidence indicates that the risk of severe illness is higher in men than women, at older ages, and in people with at least one pre-existing health condition (co-morbidity).

We would like to understand better the extent to which different factors increase the likelihood of covid-19 infection that leads to hospital admission, admission to an intensive care unit, or death. Among those who are admitted to hospital and survive, we would like to better understand the long term risk of developing new lung or heart and other disease, and of deterioration in pre-existing conditions.

This information will help to guide preventive strategies (e.g. modification of factors that increase vulnerability or shielding those who are most vulnerable), and also long-term clinical care for patients who have recovered from covid-19 infection.","Evidence from around the globe indicates that most people infected by covid-19 will have only mild illness, but in approximately 20% of cases, the disease is more severe, requiring hospital admission. Among those admitted to hospital, ~1 in 4 require intensive care/and or die. Others may die from covid-19 without being admitted to hospital. To inform preventive strategies, there is a need to understand better what determines vulnerability to more severe illness, and to what extent. It is currently not clear if there are avoidable risk factors for admission, severe disease and/or death. For example, early papers suggest a low representation of smokers among those admitted, which is unexpected, but greater risk of severe disease. This information might allow modification of some factors that increase vulnerability, and help to work out those who could benefit most from shielding. In addition, it is important to find out whether people who recover from such illness incur an increased long-term risk of cardio-respiratory morbidity or of other types of illness.

To explore risk factors for hospital admission for covid-19, we will undertake a case control study using CPRD Gold and Aurum primary care data linked with HES inpatient data and ONS mortality data. Cases will be those individuals admitted to hospital with covid-19 and/or dying from the disease, with 5 controls per case matched on GP practice, sex and age. Using conditional logistic regression, we will investigate potential risk factors such as smoking, pre-existing conditions and medication.

To explore long-term health risks following hospital admission for covid-19, we will then follow up the cases and controls as a cohort, and use conditional Poisson regression to determine whether or not the cases have higher subsequent risk of deterioration in pre-existing disease or development of new cardiovascular, respiratory or other morbidity (e.g. heart failure, obstructive lung disease, mental health problems). The first analysis of outcomes will be at least 12 months after entry to follow-up.","In the case-control study, the main outcome will be admission to hospital for, or death from, covid-19 infection. Within this, a sub-set of more severe disease will be defined by admission to an intensive care unit and/or death from the disease.

For the cohort study, the exact specification of outcomes for analysis will depend on their frequency in the cohort as a whole (covid-19 patients and controls) at the time, and on the scientific evidence that has by then emerged regarding possible long-term effects of infection (which will be monitored continually over the follow-up period). To the extent that numbers are sufficient for meaningful statistical analysis, they will include measures of:
- Cumulative incidence of recurrent/new covid-19 infection (confirmed by serology or probable from clinical presentation) classified according to severity (e.g. leading to hospital admission, admission to intensive care or death)
- New or exacerbated cardio-respiratory disease
- New or exacerbated renal disease
- New or exacerbated auto-immune disease
- Cumulative frequency of respiratory infections other than serologically confirmed/probable Covid-19 infection
- Cumulative frequency of non-respiratory infections
- New or exacerbated mental illness","Jennifer Quint - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

People who had certain cancers diagnosed recently and are receiving treatments like chemotherapy are among those known to be at high risk, because some cancers and treatments weaken the immune system. But it is not known whether people who had cancer some time ago and have likely finished their cancer treatments are at higher risk if they catch the virus.

This study will investigate this in two ways, using data from routinely collected health records. First, we will look at how common known risk factors for severe COVID-19, such as heart disease and respiratory disease, are in cancer survivors compared to people who have never had cancer. Second, we will investigate whether cancer survivors are more likely than people who have never had cancer to get severe influenza requiring hospitalisation, or leading to death. The second approach is based on the fact that there is likely substantial overlap between people at high risk of severe influenza, and people at high risk of severe COVID-19. Indeed, because COVID-19 is completely new, public health organisations have had to base many of their decisions about how to handle the disease on evidence from influenza.

Our study will add to the evidence informing public health organisations and government whether cancer survivors need to be considered high-risk as policies such as isolation and social distancing evolve.","Older individuals and people with certain underlying health conditions are known to be at higher risk of having severe disease if they contract the novel COVID-19.

1616634534-2690,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=1,Defining clinical research phenotypes using SNOMED CT,"Diagnoses in general practice electronic health records are recorded using standardised codes from a terminology. However, there are often many possible codes for a single diagnosis. When using electronic health records for clinical research, researchers have to search many individual diagnosis codes in order to classify patients correctly by their diagnosis.

The new coding system called SNOMED CT may make this process easier. SNOMED CT is increasingly becoming the standard system for recording diagnoses in the NHS. It includes detailed information on how each term relates to other terms, such as if one diagnosis is a subtype of another diagnosis. This means that it is possible to find all the terms for a condition such as diabetes with a simple expression ('all subtypes of diabetes') rather than listing them all out. However, the exact set of SNOMED CT terms identified by this method may not be the same as what researchers and clinicians would choose if they were doing so manually. 

In this study we will investigate whether the SNOMED CT method ends up with a similar set of terms as a manual search, and when the terms are used to classify patient records in the database, whether the numbers and characteristics of patients with a particular diagnosis differs between the methods. We will initially test this technique on a random sample of patients for diagnoses of diabetes, asthma and heart failure, and if successful, expand the technique to other diseases. This will facilitate future studies using these databases.","Research studies using electronic health record databases need to identify patients with particular diagnoses using definitions based on coded entries (such as Read codes or ICD-10 codes). The lists of codes that define a diagnosis of interest have typically been defined using keyword searching (Read) or by traversing a hierarchy (ICD-10). However, diagnoses are increasingly encoded using SNOMED CT, which incorporates an ontology which encodes relationships between terms. In principle, the ontology could be used to create a set of terms for a concept based on a single term or SNOMED CT expression, but this has not previously been tested against other methods of creating sets of SNOMED CT terms of interest.

In this study we will develop a method to interpret SNOMED CT expressions and compare the resulting set of SNOMED CT concepts with those derived from keyword searching on the SNOMED CT descriptions, or from previously published phenotype definitions on the CALIBER portal (https://caliberresearch.org/portal/codelists) (mapped from Read V2 to SNOMED CT using the NHS mappings). We will compare the SNOMED CT terms selected by the two methods and use them to generate cohorts of patients from a random sample of CPRD Aurum. We will compare the number of patients, date of diagnosis, age distribution and sex distribution using the two methods. We will initially study a number of common disease examples with existing published phenotype definitions such as diabetes, asthma and heart failure, and then expand to other phenotypes used for CALIBER studies (e.g. https://github.com/spiros/chronological-map-phenotypes).

We will publish the methods and code used to interpret SNOMED CT expressions, and if our approach is successful it could be used in future research projects to assist in phenotype definition. This could make future research studies quicker and more reproducible, leading to patient benefit from higher quality research.","Comparison of phenotype definitions (sets of SNOMED CT terms) derived using different methods.

It's caused by a type of virus called a coronavirus. The virus has rapidly spread around the world, and is associated with a high risk of serious complications, including the need for specialised hospital care (for example, use of a breathing machine, or ventilator) and death.

We know that older people and individuals with pre-existing health problems who develop COVID-19 are at higher risk of serious disease or death. It is therefore important that we understand exactly which patients are at the greatest risk of harm, so that we can ensure those individuals can try and minimise their exposure to the virus (called “social distancing”), treat people earlier if possible, and make sure treatments are prioritised for those patients that are most likely to benefit.

We will aim to find out which existing health problems, drug treatments, or other factors (for example, smoking or pregnancy) are most strongly associated with people being admitted to intensive care or dying as a complication of COVID-19. We will do this by looking at routinely collected data from GP practices, hospital intensive care and national death records.

We intend to undertake the research extremely quickly, so that the findings can be passed on to the NHS and public health authorities to help guide care for the wider population as soon as possible.","COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving problem, presenting huge challenges to health services. There is an urgent need for tools to help clinicians, managers and policymakers decide how to optimise social distancing measures and to best deliver services to the most critically ill patients.

The proposed research will take advantage of a new linkage between the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC), COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS) and Second Generation Surveillance (SGSS) datasets and aims to develop a risk stratification tool to determine which patients in primary care are at highest risk of admission to intensive care and which pre-morbid factors predict survival. We will specifically look for causal associations with cardiovascular drug therapy as this is amenable to change and thus a potential opportunity for intervention.

Survival models will be developed to describe the association between key pre-morbid clinical factors (e.g. sociodemographics, comorbidities, prescribing, other clinical factors) and three key outcomes: intensive care admission, intensive care survival, and length of intensive care stay. Standard established methodological approaches to data processing and analysis will be undertaken to minimise the time taken to develop the necessary models. Advanced methodologies to account for known biases (confounding by indication and selection bias) will be used to explore pharmacoepidemiological relationships between cardiovascular medication and COVID-19 outcomes.

The resulting risk stratification tools will have value in identifying individuals at greatest risk of severe illness, enabling more tailored social distancing, facilitating early pre-emptive care, targeting any future vaccine delivery, and planning for use of intensive care facilities. The linked dataset would also facilitate other epidemiological analyses of COVID-19.","Primary outcome

Since November 2019, over 1.9 million people have been infected worldwide and as of April 2020 over 121,000 deaths have occurred. COVID-19 has been compared to seasonal flu because some of the initial symptoms of infection include fever, cough, fatigue and muscle pain.
Anonymised primary care patient data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) have been previously used to understand the burden of respiratory viral illness on the health care system, predict whether infections may result in hospitalisation and deaths and to determine who may be at risk for these outcomes. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, it has the potential to provide important data about high risk and vulnerable populations and the potential disease burden among such patients.
This descriptive study will assess weekly and monthly trends in the diagnosis of fever, cough, fatigue and muscle pain recorded in primary care patient records during 01/01/2015 – 30/04/2020. This information may be important in estimating undiagnosed mild COVID-19 infection in the period leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trends will also be described by age group, gender, level of socioeconomic deprivation, region and rural/urban location. We will also describe pre-existing health conditions among patients with at least one symptom and examine their use of health service during the pandemic.
Findings from this study will illustrate how primary care data can be used in other research to inform health care planning, including how health measures may be targeted.","We will use CPRD primary care data to estimate weekly and monthly consultation rates for fever, cough, and fatigue or myalgia during 01/01/2015 – 30/04/2020. These non-specific symptoms are reportedly common in COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections. The rates may be useful for modelling excess recording consistent with undiagnosed mild COVID-19 cases in the early phases of the UK outbreak. Consultation rates and 95% confidence intervals for each symptom will be generated and stratified by gender, age band, level of social deprivation, region and rural/urban location.

The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with at least one respiratory infection symptom recorded during each flu season in the study period, including the 2019/2020 flu season, will also be described. Pre-existing comorbidities including respiratory and cardiovascular conditions will be based on Read coded Quality Outcomes Framework definitions used in primary care and International Classification of Disease codes (ICD-10) for hospital data in secondary analysis. Prescribing of respiratory, cardiovascular and immunosuppressing medications as well as use of health services before and during the pandemic period will also be evaluated.

In March 2020, GP software providers introduced specific COVID-19 clinical codes, including suspected and confirmed diagnoses. Anecdotal reports suggest that prior to this time GPs may have used existing coronavirus codes to record information about COVID-19 cases. We will explore patterns of recording of COVID-19 and coronavirus codes, and if numbers permit, we will describe demographic, clinical characteristics, and presenting symptoms of patients with one of these codes recorded from January 2020.

It has spread quickly since then, and on March 11th the World Health Organisation officially declared that the COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic. People with COVID-19 can have fever, cough, and breathing difficulties, often from pneumonia due to the virus. However, it seems unexpectedly there was much lower numbers of people with asthma – a long-term lung condition – in COVID-19 hospitalised patients in China, Italy. This is unexpected as virus often trigger asthma attacks and the 2009 flu pandemic asthma was a significant risk factor for people needing to be admitted to hospital. There are several thoughts on why asthma patients have less severe COVID-19 infection. It could be related to asthma medications or the type of inflammation that occurs in people with asthma.

The results will show how antibiotic prescribing has changed during the pandemic and will inform efforts to ensure antibiotics are used appropriately.","The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to impact on many areas of medical practice. This study aims to determine how antibiotic prescribing is changing during the pandemic. We expect that antibiotic prescribing might increase because large numbers of people are having respiratory infections. Primary care consultations may not be taking place in a face-to-face format, possibly leading to greater antibiotic prescribing because clinical assessments are more limited. This study will analyse antibiotic prescribing in CPRD GOLD, later validating findings in CPRD Aurum. We will include all general practices in England that provide UTS data throughout 2017 to the present. We will take a random sample of registered patients, giving a total sample of 400,000-500,000. We will analyse antibiotic prescriptions by month, as well as broad spectrum antibiotic prescriptions, and consultations for respiratory tract, urinary tract and skin infections as the common infections in primary care. We will evaluate whether the pandemic has been associated with changes in infection consultations and antibiotic prescriptions. We will also evaluate numbers of COVID-19 consultations. We will visualise the data with a scatterplot of monthly rates, fitting smoothed curves to evaluate whether onset of the pandemic in February 2020 has been associated with any departures from trend. We will fit Poisson models to 2017 to 2019 data to predict expected antibiotic prescribing in 2020. We will also fit interrupted time series models.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID19, mainly enters the body through lung cells. It interacts with a protein molecule called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The ACE2 molecule is part the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates body salt content and blood pressure. Drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system, including angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), are widely used in the treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes. This has raised concerns that these drugs might increase the risk of either patients getting COVID-19 or having worse outcomes if they have the infection. We are conducting two studies with COVID-19 patients to test these hypotheses. We have discussed the signals from these studies with the MHRA, which recommended we conduct a third study using CPRD data. In order to estimate whether ARBs or ACEIs are associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection, we will compare antihypertensive-treated COVID-19 patients with antihypertensive-treated controls of the same age and sex from the same general practice, to see if the cases are more likely to be treated with ARBs or ACEIs. In order to estimate whether ARBs or ACEIs may be associated with the course of the COVID-19 illness, we will follow-up all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and determine whether they develop pneumonia, sepsis, or acute kidney injury or are admitted to hospital, or have a fatal outcome. We will compare the risks for patients according to ARB/ACEI treatment allowing for other differences including underlying health conditions. We know that a study like this has many limitations and it may not be possible to draw conclusions about causation.","The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID19, interacts with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.

1616634498-2674,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=1,An investigation of excess mortality and end-of-life morbidity patterns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective analysis using primary care data,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may be worse among certain groups, for example ethnic minorities, people living in poorer areas, or with pre-existing illness. This could be due to the epidemic starting in cities where proportionately more Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) or poorer people live, or there may be health-related reasons, such as BAME or poorer people having more existing illness. This has been highlighted in many provisional reports focusing on hospital deaths directly attributed to COVID-19. Simply counting these gives an incomplete and possibly misleading picture of the epidemic in the community. However, a wider perspective can be obtained by counting all deaths and comparing this to the number expected from the same season over previous years. This is known as excess mortality.

Our study will use anonymised general practice medical records to examine whether excess mortality during 2020 is greater among certain groups (BAME, more deprived, pre-existing illness) compared to patterns from 2010-9. It will seek to explain variations by risk factors such as smoking or obesity, and by a wide range of medical conditions.

Additionally, we will investigate patterns of illness before death for all patients who died over the last 10 years. We will assess if people dying recently are spending more or less of their final years in good health compared to patients who died at the beginning of the study, focusing on ethnic and socio-economic differences. We will also investigate the how COVID-19 has impacted any trends here.","Preliminary analyses during the COVID-19 pandemic have reported higher risks among people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, those living in more deprived areas, and those with existing co-morbidities including diabetes. Regional variations in BAME groups and deprivation, combined with the progress of the UK epidemic may partially explain these differences, as could higher prevalences of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and associated treatments. Initial reporting largely focused on COVID-19 hospital deaths, where coding may not have been consistent throughout. Focusing on these deaths assumes that there has not been an indirect impact on mortality, with people avoiding secondary care. Therefore, a fuller assessment of the impact of COVID-19 needs to consider excess all-cause mortality as a measure of impact, while still accounting for these individual characteristics.

We will combine data from Aurum and GOLD to estimate excess mortality rates among registered adults during the pandemic period (mid-March to mid-June 2020) compared to corresponding periods in the previous ten years. Poisson regression will be used to compare excess mortality rates between pre-defined groups of interest (BAME, deprivation, co-morbidities), estimating how much the excess rate widened in 2020 for these groups. The models will seek to explain ethnic and socio-economic variations by including other individual level modifiers of COVID-19 risk such as age, smoking, obesity and pre-existing medical conditions.

Finally, we will investigate how COVID-19 has impacted on compression of morbidity. Focusing on the last 5 years of life, we will compare morbidity in all patients who died between 2010-2020 to see whether those dying recently have more morbidity before death than those dying 10 years previously, and whether there are variations by ethnicity and deprivation. Analyses will control for age at death, and a matched comparison group will be used to account for any temporal trends in recording.",Mortality (All and by Cause of Death); Emergency Hospitalisations (All and by reason for admission),"Iain Carey - Chief Investigator - St George’s, University of London

In the UK, a national lockdown closed schools, universities and most shops and workplaces. With the exception of essential workers, most working adults have been instructed to work from home, or to suspend work if home-working is not possible. Many of those continuing to work in the community face exposure to the virus and stressful working conditions, particularly healthcare workers. In addition, social distancing, shielding and self-isolation guidance have reduced people’s social contact significantly. A deep economic recession is predicted. The effects of these sudden changes on people’s mental health is not well understood. However, from looking at what has happened after similar disease outbreaks in other countries – and from what we understand from previous economic recessions – an increase in the numbers of people experiencing mental illness is likely.

As the crisis progresses, we aim to carry out rapid examination of:

- patterns of GP contact for new episodes of mental illness, self-harm, prescribing for medication for symptoms of mental illness and referrals to mental health services
- numbers of contacts among people with existing mental illness or a history of self-harm.

We will also examine longer term consequences of the pandemic in the general population, those with existing mental disorder and/or history of self-harm and survivors of COVID-19 infection. For this part of the study we will include data on hospital attendance for self-harm, admission for inpatient psychiatric care, and death due to alcohol-related causes and by suicide.","We aim to:

(i) examine the incidence and prevalence of primary care contact for mental illness and self-harm, and referrals to mental health services before, during and after the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (Phase 1)

(ii) examine longer term temporal trends in primary and secondary care contacts for mental illness, non-fatal self-harm and suicide rates, following the COVID-19 pandemic (Phase 2)

(iii) follow up persons diagnosed with COVID-19 to examine likelihood of specific mental illness, fatigue syndromes and episodes of self-harm identified from primary and/or secondary care, alcohol-related hospital admission, prescriptions for psychotropic medication in primary care and death by suicide, accidental poisoning or alcohol-related causes (Phase 3).

For all phases we aim to examine differences by age group, gender, ethnic group and practice-level deprivation (IMD quintiles). We will also examine trends in the modes of GP consultation over time.

For Phase 1 we will use primary care electronic health records included in CPRD GOLD and CPRD Aurum. First, we will estimate incidence rates of specific mental illness diagnoses, clinically significant alcohol use, prescriptions for psychotropic medication, GP referrals to psychiatric services (such as community mental health, outpatient mental health, e.g. ‘psychiatrist’, and drug and alcohol services) and episodes of self-harm. Second, we will estimate prevalence of patient contact with general practice, prescriptions for psychotropic medication and hospital-presenting self-harm among individuals with a prior diagnosis of a mental disorder and/or history of self-harm.

Primary care records will be linked to HES A&E, HES APC, HES Outpatient, patient postcode-level IMD score and ONS Death Registrations for Phase 2 and 3. Incidence rates and prevalence values will be stratified by gender, age group, ethnic group and practice-level IMD quintile. Joinpoint analysis will be used to examine significant differences in temporal trends. For Phase 3 we will use cohort study designs.","Incidence of:
- Mental illness diagnoses: anxiety disorder; depression; schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; psychoses; eating disorder; personality disorder; PTSD

Approximately 10% of those aged over 65 years have frailty. The recent Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted routine care in the health care system and there are concerns in primary care about what we can do for the most vulnerable patients in the post Covid-19 world and what interventions should be prioritised in order to help these patients. This study will identify opportunities to better target clinical improvement activities for frail multimorbid elderly patients in general practice. Anonymised electronic hearth records of frail elderly patients will be analysed. The outcomes of interest will be death (irrespective of the cause) emergency hospital admissions (and reasons),and infection-related complications, Accident and Emergency Attendance and care home admission. The medicines that were prescribed to frail elderly patients will be evaluated for their associations with increased or decreased risk of these outcomes. Of particular interest will be to look at treatment strategies that vary between general practices and identify those that could suggest potential for improvement. Experts will review the clinically important predictors. These variables will include characteristics such as extent and type of how many medicines a frail person receives and the complexity of a medication regimen. The results of this study will be used to provide feedback to GPs (using a secure internet infrastructure) which can help to identify opportunities to better target clinical improvement activities to frail patients in their practice.","Recent research in primary care found that 23·2% of the total population were multimorbid (i.e., were suffering from two or more long-term disorders). There are concerns in primary care about what we can do for the most vulnerable patients in the post Covid-19 world and what interventions should be prioritised in order to help these patients. The overall objective of this study is to identify opportunities to better target clinical improvement activities for frail multimorbid elderly patients and to evaluate the extent of variability in clinical outcomes and treatments and its predictors before and during/after Covid-19. The design will be a cohort study with nested case-control study. The main study population will be patients in participating practices who are 65 years or older and have electronic frailty index score of 0.21. The outcomes of interest will be death (irrespective of the cause), emergency hospital admissions (and reasons), infection-related complications, Accident and Emergency Attendance and care home admission. Indicators of type of clinical care and clinical measurements will be considered as modifiable predictors. A broad set of modifiable predictors will be evaluated in the development cohort and tested in the validation cohort (using Cox proportional hazards models). This will then be followed by expert review for clinically important predictors. The variables will include characteristics such as extent and type of polypharmacy, STOPP criteria (which concern potentially inappropriate prescribing or omissions) and medication regimen complexity index. propensity-matched case-control datasets will be used to identify the predictors that are associated with increased or decreased risks of the outcome of interest. The results of this study will be used to provide feedback to GPs (using a secure internet infrastructure) which can help to identify opportunities to better target clinical improvement activities to frail patients in their practice.","- all-cause mortality

All-cause mortality will be based on the death recording in the GP EHRs (with sensitivity analyses conducted with death certificate records, where available). The definition for emergency hospital admissions will be similar to that used for the prediction tool QAdmissions (Hippisley-Cox & Coupland, 2013).

Only emergency admissions where the admission date and discharge date were both recorded and where the admission date was on or before the discharge date will be included (Hippisley-Cox & Coupland, 2013). The definition for infection-related complications will be similar as used in previous studies, including infection-related hospital admissions as recorded in HES and GP-recorded complications (Mistry et al., 2020; Van Staa et al., 2020).

Much of the clinical and research focus across the UK is understandably targeting pandemic management. As healthcare resources are reallocated to the COVID-19 response, there will inevitably be decreased resources for non-COVID-19 related healthcare, including activities designed to prevent people becoming ill, such as monitoring of chronic disease, potentially creating or worsening physical and mental health of patients. Mental health is also likely to be impacted by fears around the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as control measures such as mass social distancing, closures of social spaces and self-isolation. Understanding of these indirect effects will help public health planning and policy over the following months, particularly when/if the COVID-19 pandemic is under control. The outcomes will occur in several phases. This initial body of work focuses on acute presentations in the early stages of the pandemic. Our group is also planning a further large study focused on extending this to later outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis associated with very significant morbidity and mortality. Much of the clinical and research focus across the UK is understandably targeting pandemic management. As healthcare resources are reallocated to the COVID-19 response and modifications made to methods of care delivery due to social distancing requirements, there will inevitably be an impact on non-COVID-19 related healthcare provision, including activities designed to prevent people becoming ill, such as monitoring of chronic disease, potentially creating or worsening physical and mental health of patients.
We plan to analyse changes in disease incidence, routine monitoring and health outcomes, during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial approach will be a descriptive before and after analysis. This will be followed by an interrupted time series analysis. This initial body of work focuses on acute presentations in the early stages of the pandemic. Our group is also planning a further large study focused on extending this to later outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Our programme of research focuses on a range of outcomes resulting from the diversion of resources and social distancing. This study focuses on acute manifestations of chronic comorbidities that we anticipate may be increased due to decreased resources for management of disease, including reduced availability of face-to-face consultations, and difficulty accessing medications and healthcare whilst in self-isolation.

Although we will focus on some incident conditions, we are also interested in outcomes affecting people with existing morbidity, e.g. diabetic emergencies and prescribing patterns for selected conditions.

We plan to undertake this study in several phases.

1. The first phase is the focus of this proposal. We will focus on acute adverse outcomes- the impact of resource restriction on non-COVID conditions (see Figure 1), for example diabetic emergencies.
2. The later phases will be detailed in a subsequent ISAC and will focus on intermediate outcomes (interrupted care for chronic conditions and delayed outcomes, e.g. resulting from delayed presentations and burnout from prolonged psychological trauma and economic hardship).

Although there is potentially a huge range of diagnoses that could present with acute presentations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on a number of specific outcomes in this initial proposal which plausibly could be adversely affected acutely. We have specifically selected diabetic emergencies and respiratory outcomes as these individuals are likely to be included on vulnerable and extremely vulnerable lists, making it very difficult for them to access healthcare resources. Psychological health is also likely to be impacted by fears around the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as control measures such as mass social distancing, closures of social spaces and self-isolation. Furthermore, existing mental illness may be affected by difficulty accessing medications and talking therapies whilst in self-isolation.
Detailed outcomes are listed below.

ICD Chapter X Respiratory. Acute severe asthma including exacerbations and status asthmaticus, COPD exacerbations

To understand changes in the outcomes detailed above, we will also capture activity related to chronic disease monitoring, consultations and prescribing for the specific diseases of interest- diabetes, respiratory disease and mental health.","Sinead Langan - Chief Investigator - London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)

Individuals who are at high risk of this infection have been identified. They include patients who have underlying conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and patients on immune modifying medications (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis patients). For management of these underlying conditions, these patients take anti-hypertensives and glucose lowering medications.

There has been speculation that these drugs could lead to increased risk of both the infection itself and deaths related to the infection. On the other hand there is also belief that some medications may be protective (e.g. HCQ). This has been amplified on social media and there is no current evidence to support these hypotheses.

In order to provide appropriate guidance for these high risk patients, it is essential that we conduct a pharmaco-epidemiological study to investigate the effects of these drugs on COVID-19 infection rates, hospitalisation due to COVID-19, and related deaths.","Aim:
This study will aim to identify the effect of current use of various antihypertensive treatments (ACE inhibitors, ARAs and calcium channel blockers), therapies for type 2 diabetes (SGLT2 inhibitors), NSAIDs and hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 infection rates and mortality. We will compare the rates and severity (hospitalisation due to COVID-19, mortality) of COVID-19 infection among patients prescribed with the above-mentioned drugs (with an underlying condition indicating a necessity for their prescription) compared to propensity score matched patients prescribed with comparator drugs (with the same underlying condition).

Design:
Propensity score matched cohort study with active comparators.

Target population:
Adults aged 50 years and above with a diagnosis of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis as of 30th Jan 2020.

For example, people who would usually present in primary care with cancer symptoms may not be attending due to fear of contracting COVID-19. This “accumulated” demand may lead to a spike in demand for primary and community care services in the future, leading to increased demand for secondary care services or affecting future mortality rates or other population health outcomes.

This project will provide understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on primary care and consequences for population health by measuring patterns of demand by age, sex and clinical reason prior to the pandemic and how this has changed in 2020. We will look at changes in the outcomes of consultations (e.g. referrals) and at changes in demand for people with pre-existing long-term conditions such as diabetes. The pandemic has brought health inequalities into the spotlight, and consequently we will look at demand by level of deprivation in the area.

The results from this study will feed into a wider project being conducted as part of The Health Foundation’s response to the pandemic in collaboration with other thinktanks that is looking at the change in use of health and care services by non-COVID patients. This will ultimately provide evidence and analysis that will help policymakers and system leaders manage the demand and ensure that health and social care services are configured to respond.","The aim of the study is to produce summary statistics on the use of primary care at a high level, by age, sex:
1. Consultation type (e.g. face-to-face, telephone) and role of staff member conducting consultation.
2. We will then look at changes in the reason for consultation through the diagnosis codes: showing the mention of a conditions or COVID-19,
3. The outcomes of consultations (referrals, prescribing, tests, immunisation),
4. Using diagnosis codes form the patient’s historical data, we will look at changes in items 1-3 for patients with pre-existing long-term conditions, and finally:
5. We will look at items 1-4 by practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation

We will compare the summary statistics (means and variance) of primary care activity and mortality for different groups (age, sex, pre-existing condition and local IMD) in 2020 to the same periods from the past 4 years (2016-2019), while taking into account trends in activity levels for those groups using a simple time series trend analysis, taking into account observed seasonality in primary care use and mortality. This analysis will be performed on consultation rates and mortality rates per person in the defined groups. We will then perform similar time trend analysis on the per consultation rates for face to face / phone, referral rates, prescribing rates, testing and where the diagnosis code refers to a pre-existing condition / COVID-19.

An early, high level understanding of the effect of COVID-19 on primary care use will inform policy in how best for the NHS to recover, in addition it will inform areas for further research on the impact of COVID-19 on non-COVID patients.","Primary care consultation rates – key variables are: age; sex; reasons for consultation or diagnosis (including COVID-19); consultation type; practice staff role; outcome of consultation (referral, prescribing, test, immunisation); mortality (using the ONS linkage); practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation; the presence of pre-existing long-term condition: Cancer, Diabetes, Heart Failure, Coronary Heart Disease, Atrial Fibrillation, Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder, Stroke, Chronic Kidney Disease, Chronic Liver Disease, Depression, Anxiety, Dementia","Toby Watt - Chief Investigator - The Health Foundation

We plan to determine what proportion of these patients experience mental distress symptoms and establish how the combinations of COVID-19 and mental distress impact on quality of life, disability, mortality. We will also investigate whether mental distress n relation to COVID-19 is more common among ethnic minority patients, patients with multimorbidity, and those from a poor socioeconomic background. Moreover, we will examine the consequences of mental distress for patients’ quality of life, access to health services, and continuity of care. Further, we will identify whether public health responses to the COVID-19 are associated with the development of mental distress symptoms. The findings of the project will enable us to propose intervention strategies to better address future viral infectious outbreaks across different populations.","Aims: Recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has so far affected a quarter of the world populations, from young children to older adults. Patients susceptible or diagnosed with COVID-19, their families, and health professionals are at increased risk of experiencing mental distress, including neurological symptoms. The proposed study aims to establish the epidemiology of mental distress among patients susceptible/isolated/diagnosed with COVID-19, and the impact of current care pathways on mental distress symptomatology and prognosis. Whenever feasible, these aims will be explored separately by gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status (SES).
Primary exposures: COVID-19 susceptibility/isolation/infection diagnoses and corticosteroids treatment.
Outcomes: Primary study outcome will be incidence mental distress (including neurological symptoms) events during the study period. In addition, the study will estimate COVID-19 related outcomes, including physical impairment, poor quality of life, healthcare utilisations, and all-cause mortality.
Study design: Prospective matched cohort study, including a nested case-control study.
Methods: Multivariable longitudinal analyses will be implemented using several statistical techniques, including, Cox proportion hazards regression, linear mixed effects models, and conditional logistic regression.
Linked datasets: ONS Death registration data, Index of Multiple Deprivation (practice and patient level).
Findings: The proposed study will provide novel insights into the mental and neurological distress associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic. It will also identify the impact that COVID-19 burden has on vulnerable subgroups and healthcare professionals’ mental distress. Such information will inform the development of preventive and control strategies associated with future infectious outbreaks.","The study primary outcome will be mental distress and neurological symptoms, defined as the presence of depression, anxiety, sleep problems, self-harm, cognitive impairment, seizures, unexplained pain, los of sensation. Several secondary outcomes will be investigated, including physical disability, quality of life (QoL), safety outcomes, healthcare utilisation, and all-cause mortality.","Alex Dregan - Chief Investigator - King’s College London

Many countries have implemented “social isolation” policies to reduce spread of disease and to protect the people at highest risk of dying from COVID-19. On 16 March, the Chief Medical Officer announced a list of underlying conditions, such as chronic heart disease and lung disease, which put people at even higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, recommending reduced social interaction (“social distancing”). On 22 March, further guidance added a group of 1.5 million individuals who were particularly vulnerable, such as organ transplant recipients, who should be having minimal contact with other people (“shielding”).
In order to understand an individual’s risk of dying from COVID-19, we will develop and openly report definitions of these conditions in a reliable transparent way that can be used by others. We will estimate the frequency in the general population of each of the conditions on the high risk and vulnerable patient lists. It is important to understand their background risk of dying, even without COVID-19. We will use UK GP data and hospital records to study the risk of dying over 1 year from the conditions listed as “high risk” or “extremely vulnerable” for COVID-19 infection. We will then estimate the risk of dying from COVID-19 infection. We will explore with patients and health care professionals under what circumstances sharing information on risk might under different scenarios might help with adhering to the current lifechanging guidelines, and have other benefits. It is hoped that this information will enable people to make decisions about staying at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and to have conversations with your family and health professionals.","As countries around the world implement lockdown in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, there are concerns about the sustainability and acceptability of such interventions. On 22 March the government announced that a life-changing intervention(shielding) was to be offered to 1.5million citizens in England who were extremely vulnerable, based on one of a wide range of serious health conditions, which is an historic development.

We aim to understand these underlying conditions using NHS records, specifically to: (i) develop and validate EHR phenotypes for each condition and share with the international research community on the HDR UK- CALIBER portal; (ii) estimate the age- and sex- specific prevalence of these conditions (iii) estimate age-, sex- and condition- specific background (pre-COVID-19) risk of 1-year mortality; (iv) estimate 1-year mortality risk under different assumptions of COVID-19 infection and (v) the importance of government policies regarding COVID-19 and social isolation interventions.
Using population-based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (CPRD and HES, HDR UK - CALIBER), we will study underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020: “high risk” and 22 March 2020: “extremely vulnerable”) in individuals of all ages from 1997-2017. Using previously validated phenotypes (openly available for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes), we will estimate age- and sex-specific background and COVID-19-related 1-year mortality in each condition, assuming a range of potential impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality): relative risk 1 to 5, and a population infection rate of 0.0001-80%.
We will explore the co-design an online tool with patients, public, researchers, clinicians, policymakers and public health professionals to provide information about COVID-19-related policies, background risk of mortality and risk of COVID-related mortality. Subject to stakeholder feedback and iterative improvement, we will work with policy makers to explore implementation of the tool for public use to inform the public of their own risk of baseline and COVID-related mortality.",#NAME?,"Amitava Banerjee - Chief Investigator - University College London (UCL)

Severe forms of the diseases are usually diagnosed in infancy. Less severe forms can be difficult to diagnose as they are uncommon and present with a range of symptoms seen in other conditions. However, early diagnosis can allow prompt initiation of treatment, reducing the occurrence and severity of disease symptoms and extending life expectancy.
The study will provide updated information on how commonly Pompe disease and Fabry disease occur in the UK. The health of the populations with these diseases will be described.  The study will report the average frequency of clinical symptoms, disabilities, survival and use of healthcare. The cost of their healthcare use will be estimated.","For IOPD, LOPD and  Fabry disease, CPRD databases will be used to estimate the incidence (2000 to 2019) and point prevalence (2019) per 100,000 population, and the age and sex distribution at diagnosis. Observed survival from diagnosis to CPRD death date will be estimated as fixed duration survivals and as a survival plot with a mean reported. The prevalence of co-morbidities related to the conditions as of 31st December 2019 will be reported based on HES and CPRD. Mean healthcare resource use per month in secondary care (HES) and primary care (CPRD) will be estimated and costed. Secondary care resource utilisation will include total admitted time, admissions/bed days, outpatient appointments, A&E visits. which will be costed using HES generated Health Resource Group (HRG) including inpatient, outpatient, and A&E tariff costs.

Infectious diseases, including respiratory and urinary tract infections, are the most common reasons why patients see a GP. We think the COVID-19 lockdown may have changed the way patients seek healthcare for infectious diseases, and how GPs treat these infections.

Using anonymised primary care medical records, we would like to find out
1. Whether more or less a) infectious diseases are being diagnosed, and b) drugs used to treat infections are being prescribed, during the UK COVID-19 lockdown, and if changes are related to practice characteristics such as poverty, previous infection consultation behaviour
2. If certain patients with an infection are more or less likely to be treated with antibacterial/antivirals
3. Which medications are being prescribed to patients with COVID-19
4. Whether more or less patients registered to practices with fewer infectious disease diagnoses are going to hospital with an infectious disease.

The information will help us understand whether patients are seeking help less for infectious diseases in general practice, and whether this leads to more hospital attendances, and if GPs are changing the way they prescribe medication for infectious disease. Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the general population’s health will inform the delivery of primary care during the potential second wave of COVID-19 expected in the Autumn.","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of primary care has rapidly changed to meet sudden increases in demand and social distancing measures to reduce the potential spread of infection. Furthermore, patients are changing their health seeking behaviour, with reductions in health service utilisation. Infectious diseases are the most common presentations treated in primary care, with respiratory tract infections the most frequently prescribed antibiotics. Given these changes in health service use and delivery, it is unknown how the management of infectious disease in primary care will be impacted during the COVID-19 lockdown. Opportunities for early intervention may be being missed, potentially leading to serious complications and greater use of acute care services during a period when they are already overwhelmed.
The objective of this study is to investigate changes in diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, and associated hospital admissions, during the COVID-19 UK lockdown.
We will conduct a retrospective cohort analysis comparing practice-rates of infectious disease diagnoses and antibacterial and antiviral prescriptions pre and during the COVID-19 lockdown. We will investigate practice and patient-level factors associated with changes in the treatment of specific infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Furthermore, we will examine whether changes in practice-level hospital attendance for infectious diseases are associated with changes in diagnosis and prescribing in primary care. Mixed-effect regression models will be used to investigate associations with practice and patient-level factors.
Little attention is currently being paid to general practice, and results from this study will provide an insight into the changes in diagnosis and treatment of the most common presentations in primary care during COVID-19 lockdown, and the potential impact on hospital attendance for non-COVID-19 infections. Findings will inform the delivery of primary care for the management of infectious disease during a potential COVID-19 second wave, expected in Autumn.","Four main outcomes will be measured in this study.
- Changes in practice-level rates of specific infectious disease diagnoses, per 1,000 patients pre and during COVID-19 lockdown
- Changes in practice-level rates of antibacterial and antiviral prescribing, per 1,000 patients pre and during COVID-19 lockdown
- Change in practice-level rates of hospital attendance with specific infectious disease diagnoses, per 1,000 patients

As many as 10% of the population have a condition where the heart beats irregularly, called atrial fibrillation, which is also a risk factor for stroke. Those with atrial fibrillation typically receive medication that thins the blood to prevent blockage type strokes. However, there are several types of strokes and blood pressure still remains an important risk factor for certain types of stroke (and other cardiovascular (heart, brain or blood vessels) and non-cardiovascular problems). In particular, if blood pressure is high, one may be at higher risk of having a bleeding type stroke on the brain. Though blood thinners minimise blockage type strokes, they increase the risk of bleeding type strokes. Currently, there are no established blood pressure thresholds for patients on blood thinning medication. This study will help inform current practice and provide the potential to set thresholds to ensure safer initiation and maintenance processes for doctors using blood thinners.","The primary objective of this research is to understand the blood pressure (BP) thresholds at which recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, all cause-mortality as well as symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage and significant gastrointestinal bleeding occur post non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOACs) initiation for atrial fibrillation (AF).

People with obesity are more likely to have depression and to be prescribed antidepressants than other people. Antidepressants lead to weight gain to a variable degree. In people with obesity, antidepressants might have different risks for serious outcomes such as death due to heart disease and stroke, other non-fatal diabetes and cardiovascular events, suicide and self-harm, fractures and falls.

We will find out if different classes of antidepressant drugs and commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs are linked with serious outcomes in people who are overweight or obese. We will do this in people with a first episode of depression that is treated with no antidepressant, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, tricyclic or other antidepressant. We will also look at different types of antidepressants. We will compare each serious outcome in each class of antidepressant or no antidepressant.  We will do this by looking at anonymised patient records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to hospital records and deaths. We will consider in our analysis other risks for these outcomes such as smoking, other prescribed drugs and other physical and mental health conditions.

We will work with our patient and public representatives on how best to present this information to help patients and prescribers make the best decisions when considering the use of antidepressant drugs for depression in people who are overweight or obese.","In population cohort studies using primary care records linked to hospital episode statistics and records of deaths, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, tricyclic and other antidepressants show differences in serious outcomes such as suicide, fractures and mortality.

Cohort studies show that antidepressants vary in relation to weight gain so it is possible that they might have different risks for cardiovascular mortality and diabetes outcomes as well.

Using CPRD linked to hospital episode statistics and mortality records, we will determine the relative risk of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants and antidepressant classes on serious outcomes related to cardiovascular health, mortality, diabetes and suicidality in people with first episode depression who were previously found to be overweight or obese. We will use Cox proportional hazards modelling to assess the effect of individual antidepressants and classes of antidepressants on the serious outcomes. We will control for confounding variables such as smoking, alcohol intake, other prescribed medication, other physical and mental health diagnostic comorbidities known to be associated with cardiovascular outcomes, mortality and depression outcomes.

The various forms of diabetic foot disease impair patients' quality of life and affect social participation. Between 0.03% and 1.5% of the population with diabetes may require some type of amputation, whereas among patients with diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU) this may run as high as 25%. Most ulcers can be prevented by screening for risk factors for a foot at risk of complications and good foot care.

Scoring systems for prediction of DFU in patients with diabetes perform relatively well in a hospital setting, but poor in a primary care setting. Furthermore, clinical risk scores that predict development of DFU by type  do not exist. Additionally, current scores are difficult to interpret. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop and validate a score for DFU, broken down by type using traditional, and sophisticated automated techniques.","The study objective is to develop prognostic scores for risk of diabetic foot ulceration (DFU), broken down by aetiology (composite, ischaemic, neuropathic, infected), in patients with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients aged 18 years or older with a registration of T1DM or T2DM between April 2004 and time of data extraction (approximately March 2019) will be included. The date of first diagnosis will define start of follow-up. All patients will be followed up for the occurrence of DFU (composite and aetiology specific), date of transfer out of practice area, death, end of data collection, or end of risk period (1, 5, 10, or 15 years), whichever will come first.

Both traditional epidemiological methods and machine learning techniques will be applied to develop and validate the prognostic scores.

Traditional: Regression models will be fitted with a predefined set of determinants for DFU, using forward selection with a significance level of 0.05. Various measures for prognostic accuracy including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and beta-coefficients of the included factors will be determined. The beta-coefficients in the final Cox models will be converted into 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year absolute risk scores. The models' performance will be determined by assessing goodness-of-fit and by assessment of the discriminative ability. To asses internal validity a k-fold cross-validation will be conducted.

Machine learning: The study population will be split into a `training' cohort and a 'test' cohort. The training cohort will be used to develop the prediction models using machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The models will be trained through 10-fold cross-validation. The test dataset will be used for model evaluation.

Strategies to better control this disease must include predisposing factors. One of these factors is smoking and a significant proportion of asthmatics are smokers. Despite the logical expectation that people with asthma would avoid exposure to cigarette smoke, studies suggest that smoking behaviour is prevalent among asthmatics at a rate similar or higher to that found in the general population.
Cigarette smoke triggers tightening of the lungs (bronchoconstriction) in asthmatic patients. Smoking asthmatics have more severe breathing problems, worse quality of life and a faster loss of breathing ability compared to non-smoking asthmatics. They are also more likely to have emergency room visits and are at a higher risk of dying following hospitalization for near-fatal asthma events.
Despite the importance of smoking as a factor in asthma, clinical trials studying new drugs for asthma generally exclude smokers. 
We are interested in examining smoking asthma patients' response to specific classes of inhaler drugs called inhaled corticosteroids and if an add-on LAMA therapy results in better treatment of asthma in smokers, which would identify the benefit of add-on therapies in smoking asthmatics that could be addressed by new asthma medications.","The primary Objective is to compare the annualized rate of exacerbation among smoking asthmatics in two cohorts.

AD may flare up due to reasons that vary from person to person, such as changes in weather, exposure to pollen, pet dander, certain types of food or food components, or even for no apparent reason at all. The cause of this sensitivity is not yet fully understood, but it appears that your genes may play a role, as the condition seems to be passed on from one generation to another. 

This study aims to determine whether a definition of how severe AD is can be created using just data from health records. This study will first explore whether this data-based definition will successfully reflect a difference in outcomes. For example, we would like to see whether severe AD as defined using data will result in those patients using up larger healthcare resources, such as more admissions to hospital, or more outpatient appointments. 

With a reliable definition of AD severity, we can utilise this definition in further studies on AD using datasets, which present a more practical, faster, and less expensive way of performing such research. Assessment of severity would also be useful for policy change and resource allocation in England.","Atopic dermatitis is a highly prevalent condition in the United Kingdom. Datasets have become very useful in assessing the impact of various diseases, including AD, on the National Health Service. This effort is particularly important in the face of tightening budgets for healthcare in the country.

The definition of conditions in various datasets is an important task to improve the reliability and accuracy of estimates of healthcare resource use and clinical outcomes. A poor definition would result in an unreliable picture on which to base health policy and intervention in the health system.

This study aims to determine whether severity of AD as defined through codes in datasets have the increased cost and clinical outcome implications that are expected with clinical definitions. We plan to use a definition combining the use of immunosuppressants, systemic corticosteroids, HRG tariffs with a certain complication score, and atopic dermatitis as a primary inpatient admission diagnosis as criteria defining a cohort of patients with moderate to severe AD. All other AD shall be classified as mild.

We shall then measure prevalence, patient demographics and clinical profiles, co-morbidities, clinical outcomes, healthcare resource use and costs for each of these cohorts. The goal is to determine if there is a significant difference in these outcomes between the mild AD, and moderate to severe AD. A significantly higher healthcare resource use, and worse clinical outcomes would indicate that the data-based definition is functionally viable and may be used for further research endeavours on these datasets.","Prevalence (prevalence of AD, prevalence of mild AD, prevalence of moderate to severe AD, prevalence of co-morbidities including asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, allergic urticaria, anxiety, cutaneous bacterial infection, depression, eosinophilic oesophagitis, food allergies), demographics (total patients, age, percent males, family history of atopy, time in cohort, follow-up), clinical outcomes (remission rate, absolute refractory rate, relapse rate, skin infection rate), healthcare resource use outcomes (inpatient admissions, inpatient length of stay, 30-day readmission rate, inpatient HRG tariffs, outpatient appointments, outpatient HRG tariffs, A&E attendances, GP appointments, nursing appointments in primary care, diagnostic tests in primary care, referrals in primary care, medications in primary care, consultation costs in primary care, prescription costs in primary care)","Dr Adrian Paul J.

1616634064-2494,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=10,Type 2 Diabetes in women after a diagnosis of gestational diabetes: understanding uptake to screening and progression rates- a retrospective cohort study in the CPRD database,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is a disease that normally appears during the second half of pregnancy, without any proof of pre-existing type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Around 7% of all pregnancies are affected by GDM, with a range of 1 to 14%, based on the study population and the diagnostic tests used. Factors related with an increased risk of GDM include being obese, having GDM during a past pregnancy, having a previous baby weighing 4.5 kg or above, having a sibling or parent with diabetes, or being part of a certain minority ethnic group. A previous GDM diagnosis holds a risk of up to 60% for future T2DM, a fact that highlights the value of screening following labour. The UK guidelines recommend offering a fasting glucose or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test by 13 weeks following birth in women with previous GDM. Women with a negative test result for T2DM following birth should be offered an annual HbA1c test. The rates of screening either shortly after, or in the years following labour in these women, can be used to promote lifestyle changes to prevent the onset of T2DM. This study aims to assess the current screening rates in these high-risk people, and to see if attendance to screening or type of screening test is related with progress to T2DM, heart disease and death. Current study findings will provide helpful information on the update of screening and related factors, since existing evidence in the UK is limited.","This study aims to estimate the proportion of women who attend post-partum follow-up and annual screening and recognise potential key factors that have an impact on these rates. The cohort will include patients with no previous diagnosis of T1DM or T2DM, diagnosed with GDM between 01/01/2000 and 05/11/2018 and having at least 12 months of follow-up. Previous research indicates that GDM is underreported in primary care and using linked primary-secondary care data will add a significant number of GDM cases to our cohort. Evaluation of screening rates and factors associated with them will be investigated in our cohort. In cases where women have GDM in multiple pregnancies, the first pregnancy complicated by occurrence will be used as the index pregnancy. Post-partum follow-up will be defined as any recorded glucose testing within 6 months of delivery. Determinants of screening uptake such as age, time since diagnosis, ethnicity, pregnancy outcome, previous pregnancies, delivery mode, pregnancy complications, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol intake, deprivation index, body mass index (BMI), mental health and geographic area will be extracted based on the information available within CPRD-HES data. Additionally, we will investigate progression to T2DM based on the type of screening test performed (fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) and long-term cardiovascular and mortality outcomes in women who attended screening compared to those who did not. We will use multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association of several factors to screening uptake and missing data will be addressed through complete-case analysis and multiple imputation. This study will provide novel and inclusive information about post-partum and annual screening for T2DM in women with previous GDM and the determinants of these rates, which will aid clinicians and healthcare professionals in improving the quality of provided health services.","- Post-partum screening rates following GDM; defined as any glucose testing within 6 months of delivery.

1616634067-2495,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=10,The balance between face-to-face and phone consultations in primary care and its effect on hospital demand: A longitudinal observational study,"Background and purpose of the study: 
Offering the right balance of access routes is difficult for GP practices, as patient needs range from urgent conditions to non-urgent services, routine check-ups and follow-up visits. Some practices offer a high level of telephone consultations, whereas, others limit their GP and nurse time to face-to-face appointments. 
Whether the consultation is with the patient's regular GP or not can also affect the need for the patient to return to primary care. Continuity of care is shown to have many benefits, though there has been a decline in continuity of care in recent years and the exact causes of the decline have been a matter of speculation. 
An appointment with the regular GP entails continuity of care as the GP will have information about the patients' health status, enabling a more meaningful consultation. We therefore expect the balance between the two types of consultations to vary depending on whether the consultation was with the patients' regular or another GP in the practice.
We are interested in answering two main questions: 
1. What factors within the primary care setting have driven the decline in continuity of care, and specifically, which factor is most important?  Only once we understand these factors, can the GP practices manage continuity better.
2. How does the variation in type of consultations and whether the consultation is with the regular GP or not, affect the primary care and secondary care usage of their patients? 
If a practice offers a high percentage of telephone consultations, it may lead to increased A&E activity as patients will use A&E as an alternative access route. On the contrary, a high percentage of telephone consultations may provide easy access to healthcare professionals, which can lead to decreased A&E activity. Limiting face-to-face consultations may lead to more outpatient activity, as GPs increase referrals to manage their limited capacity. Furthermore, these effects can be moderated by seeing the patients regular GP for the consultation.
We aim to understand this relationship between access to healthcare professionals in the GP setting and their patients' usage of primary and secondary care resources. 
Potential importance of the findings: The NHS General Practice Forward View and NHS Long Term Plan commit significant new resources to GP practices. In return, the NHS expects that GP practices will change their offering to reduce system usage. This research project provides insights into the potential to achieve this through appropriate triaging, balanced appointment offerings and the patient's ability to see their usual doctor in GP practices.","Research Question 1:
Study aim and objectives. 
We will study and quantify the relationship between different demand and supply factors as exposure variables, and the ability of the patient to see his regular GP as the main outcome variable. We expect that a combination of increase in demand and a reduction in supply leads to a reduction in continuity of care. 

Design. 
Our design is a longitudinal study that estimates effects of the exposure variable on the outcome variable within practices over time. 

Statistical methodology. 
We estimate this relationship between exposure and outcome variables by first breaking down the demand and supply factors into relevant and meaningful measures, aggregating the measures at the practice-month level and ultimately estimating a longitudinal model, specifically, a fixed-effects panel data model. 

Research Question 2:
Study aim and objectives. 
We will study the relationship between a practice's balance of telephone to face-to-face consultations (ratio of telephone consultations to face-to-face consultations) as the primary exposure variable, and, patients return frequency to the GP practice(number of face to face consultations in the next year), A&E visits, emergency admissions, emergency bed days and outpatient visits (annualized per capita) of registered practice patients as outcome variables.  We will use the percentage of consultations with a patient's regular GP as a moderator variable to see if relationship between our outcome and primary exposure variables differs.

We expect that a lower rate of face to face consultations in the current year may increase the patients return frequency to the practice in the next year. We also expect that a higher rate of face-to-face consultations leads to decreased outpatient activity, but a higher rate of telephone consultations at the expense of face-to-face time, may or may not lead to decreased A&E activity. Since capacity is limited, the tradeoff between telephone and face-to-face time for different patient segments, provided by different healthcare professionals, needs to be well understood. These effects may be more or less pronounced if the practice offers a higher ability for patients to have consultations with their regular GP. 

We aim to estimate the relationship between exposure and outcomes and to identify a range of telephone appointment rates that balance the effects on A&E and outpatient activity and lead to low overall secondary care usage.  We will break this down by the type of healthcare professional as well as patient segments. 

Design. Our design is a hybrid design, estimating cross-sectional and longitudinal effects simultaneously.

Statistical methodology. 
We estimate the relationship between exposure and outcomes using the following steps. First, we develop prediction models that allows us to predict the annual expected value of the 5 outcome variables as a function of patient characteristics alone. Second, we calculate for each outcome, a standardized outcome for each practice and year as the ratio of the sum of observed outcomes to the sum of model-predicted outcomes. A GP practice with a ratio below 1 will use fewer secondary care resources than expected for its patient population, a practice with a ratio above 1 will use more. Third, we estimate the relationship between exposure, standardized outcomes and the moderator, using multi-level longitudinal models. We use subsample and interaction models to assess the effects on subpopulations.","1. The main outcome variable for the first research question is chosen to capture the extent to which a practice is able to deliver continuity of care between a patient and their regular GP. We measure this as the percentage of consultations in which patients see their regular GP in a given practice-month. Section N describes in detail how this measure is calculated.
2. Primary outcomes of interest: per capita annual number of face-to-face appointments (in the subsequent year), per capita annual number of A&E visits for the practice population; per capita annual number of emergency admissions for the practice population; per capita annual number of emergency bed days for the practice population; per capita annual number of outpatient visits for the practice population.
The capitation (size of registered list) of a practice will be estimated from the observed number of patient consultations in a year, using published average numbers of annual GP patient consultations by age groups (1). 
For reporting purposes, we would only specify practices as small/medium/large.","Professor Stefan Scholtes - Chief Investigator - University of Cambridge

1616634100-2510,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=10,The effect of common infections on the risk of dementia in individuals with and without diabetes: a cohort study using UK primary and secondary care data,"Dementia is a major public health burden posing a devastating impact on individuals, caregivers and healthcare services. In the UK, it was estimated that around 850,000 people were living with dementia in 2015 and this number is projected to rise to over 1 million by 2025. Due to the rising ageing population and lack of medications that can cure or prevent dementia, it has become increasingly important to identify factors that can reduce the risk of dementia. Over, the last few decades, there has been growing interest on the role of infections on the risk of dementia. However, it remains unclear whether people with common infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections, have a higher chance of developing dementia. Additionally, common infections frequently occur in people with diabetes, and in turn diabetes is associated with dementia.

Therefore, we aim to carry out a study where we will follow individuals over time using anonymous data from primary care and hospital health records to investigate whether people with common infections are at an increased risk of developing dementia and whether this risk differs in people with and without diabetes. Infections and diabetes are potentially preventable and therefore a better understanding of how these conditions affect the risk of dementia could lead to important public health interventions. These interventions may include strategies to increase the uptake of vaccines to prevent infections, and early recognition and treatment of infections in people with diabetes to reduce the risk of developing dementia.","Dementia poses a significant burden on disability and dependence worldwide. Due to the increasing ageing population and absence of pharmacological therapies that can delay the onset or progression of dementia, dementia risk reduction has become a public health priority. Recent evidence suggests that the incidence of dementia is declining in Europe and the USA, and this change has been partly attributed to modifiable risk factors. Common infections have been identified as potential risk factors for dementia. In turn, common infections are more prevalent in diabetes, which is a strong risk factor for dementia. We hypothesise that individuals diagnosed with common infections (lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue infections and sepsis) will have an increased risk of dementia, and that this risk will increase in individuals with diabetes compared to those without diabetes.  

To test this hypothesis, we will carry out a cohort study of older adults aged 65 years and over using prospectively collected CPRD data linked to hospital episode statistics. We will exclude individuals with prevalent dementia and cognitive impairment at baseline. We will assess the age-specific incidence rates of dementia in individuals with and without common infections. Then, we will use Cox regression models to investigate the effect of the type, timing and frequency of infections on the incidence of dementia, adjusting for confounding factors. We will then investigate the presence of effect modification by diabetes on the association between common infections and incident dementia. Finally, we will investigate whether there is an association between common infections and evidence of cognitive impairment. To the test the robustness of our findings, we will carry out a range of sensitivity analyses. Improved understanding of the interrelationship between infections and diabetes with incident dementia will help to inform dementia risk reduction interventions.","Primary Outcomes

Endometriosis can cause chronic pain and infertility. The number of adolescent patients with endometriosis, as well as the number of adolescent patients newly diagnosed with endometriosis each year, have been measured by researchers in different countries. However, these researchers have used different age ranges for the adolescent age group as well as different definitions for endometriosis. This study will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 2006-2016 as well as linked hospital episode statistics data (HES) to estimate the number of adolescent patients 10-17 years of age diagnosed with endometriosis, as well as the number of adolescent patients newly diagnosed with endometriosis, each year.

The prevalence and incidence of endometriosis in the adolescent population has been reported in a number of population based on epidemiologic studies in the published literature.  Prevalence and incidence estimates likely vary across studies in the published literature due to differing age ranges for the adolescent age group, varying case definitions (some studies required surgical confirmation of endometriosis while others did not), varying medical practice across countries, and differences in study time periods. This retrospective cohort study will build upon the findings from a recent study in the UK population and will extend these findings to estimate the incidence and prevalence, and associated 95% confidence intervals, of endometriosis (with and without surgical confirmation) within a population-based sample of UK adolescents age 10-17 years of age.

Medication is the mainstay of treatment, and it is often required long-term. Lithium remains the best maintenance mood stabiliser for bipolar disorder. However, only 30% of individual's prescribed lithium will have a good therapeutic response. Concerns about adverse effects of lithium, especially kidney failure, have led to a decline in its use. Presently, there is no reliable way to predict lithium responders, or those who will require an alternative drug, e.g., a second-generation antipsychotic. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict who is at risk of kidney failure with lithium or will experience adverse effects whilst taking second generation antipsychotics (most of which are related to weight gain). Other reasons for patients stopping medication are also poorly understood.

To address these issues, We will use CPRD to identify bipolar disorder characteristics that predict response and adverse events during drug treatment. Results will ultimately aid personalised treatment choices, leading to improved medication effectiveness and reduced side effect burden.","AIMS
To personalise prescribing for people with bipolar disorder via prediction models that quantify the potential benefits and risks of existing treatments based on phenotypic characteristics of the individual.

Asthma treatments can be broadly classified as either reliever (generally short-acting bronchodilators) or maintenance therapy (inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators).  The goal of asthma management is to achieve and maintain control of symptoms and reduce the risk of future exacerbations with the minimum possible treatment. 

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines have been widely adopted and recommend the use of maintenance therapy when asthma symptoms become persistent with adjustments to medication regimes and doses depending on how well a patient's symptoms are controlled.

Although studies describing the use of asthma medications at a fixed point in time exist, currently there is limited real-wold information on how patients have their asthma therapies adjusted over time.

This study will examine the treatment changes, healthcare contacts and patient characteristics of people with asthma who have newly started maintenance therapy, exploring how treatment are adjusted and provide information on how patients are treated in the real world. In turn, this data may help optimisation and aid the appropriate selection of therapy for people with asthma.","This study will utilise a retrospective cohort. New users of maintenance asthma medication will be identified between January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015. The first new use prescription for a maintenance medication during this period will be the index prescription.  

New use will be defined as no prescription for maintenance asthma medication in the 12 months prior to index. New users will be grouped into three cohorts: new use of (1) an inhaled corticosteroid and long acting bronchodilator (ICS/LABA), (2) an ICS, or (3) an oral maintenance medication. 

Descriptive statistics will be utilized to characterize the cohorts of new users regarding demographics, comorbidities, healthcare resource use, exacerbations, and selected clinical characteristics at index. The index medication will be described by inhaled corticosteroid component and inhalation device where applicable.

The stoma redirects flow of food, stool, urine or other substances from their usual route and directs them outside the body. A colostomy is a stoma originating from the large intestine. An ileostomy is a stoma originating from the latter segment of the small intestine. A urostomy is a stoma originating from the urinary tract.

There are may reasons for a stoma to be formed. The usual reasons are related to problems in the downstream flow of digestive products or urine, such as blockage from growths or tumours, inflammation, or malformations from birth.

Because flow is redirected through an unusual route, complications may result. These complications may include infections, mental health issues, and skin problems. Many of those complications require attention by healthcare professionals, resulting in appointments with the GP, or even admissions in hospitals. These interactions with the National Health Service (NHS) result in costs incurred by the health system in England.

This study would like to quantify the complications and costs that colostomies, ileostomies and urostomies pose to the NHS in England in primary and secondary care.

We would like to compare these costs and complications with other patients who do not have stomas. This way, we will be able to determine what additional costs and complications patients with stomas have, compared to the general patient population. Ultimately, these findings may influence policies surrounding the care, and payment of care, of patients with stomas.","Colostomies, ileostomies and urostomies are interventions meant to alleviate the symptom and disease burden of conditions that affect the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. By redirecting the flow of digestive products or urine cutaneously, the downstream tracts are allowed to undergo treatment, excision or recovery. However, the stomas formed in these interventions may have an increased tendency towards infection and skin disruption. Having a stoma itself may cause psychological and mental health issues. These complications, in turn, result in costs to the NHS in England, in both primary and secondary care.

This retrospective cohort study seeks to determine the incremental health system burden and costs of these 3 types of stomas in primary and secondary care in England, compared to an age- and sex- matched population of patients without stomas.

Three general cohorts shall be created using read codes in primary care to identify patients with a 1) colostomy, 2) ileostomy, and 3) urostomy. Their comparison control groups shall be created using age- and sex-matching in a 1:50 proportion.

Once the cohorts and their counterpart control groups are identified, their primary and secondary care records shall be retrieved. Data on patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource use outcomes shall be extracted. The primary outcome would be the total annual cost of inpatient, outpatient, A&E and GP care. Costs will be computed utilising BNF prices, HRG tariffs, and PSSRU prices multiplied by the volume of resources consumed. Comparisons between each cohort and their counterpart control group shall be made on the outcomes specified, using either odds ratios or mean differences where applicable, with 95% confidence intervals and p-values reported. Student's unpaired t-test shall be used for comparisons of the means of two groups. Fisher's test or the chi-square test shall be performed to compare proportions in two groups.

With these comparisons, the researchers hope to quantify the incremental costs and complication burden that colostomies, ileostomies and urostomies pose to the English NHS.","Patient Demographics (total patients, age, sex, ethnicity, time from stoma creation, Charlson Comorbidity Index, time in cohort, follow-up duration); Clinical Outcomes (all-cause mortality, inpatient mortality, skin complications, psychological and behavioural complications, parastomal hernia and stomal prolapse, urinary tract infections, sepsis, revision of stoma); Healthcare Resource Use Outcomes (inpatient admissions, procedures, specialties, and costs; outpatient admissions, procedures, specialties, and costs; accident & emergency attendances, procedures and costs; GP attendances, nursing interactions, prescriptions, medications, and referrals)","Dr Adrian Paul J.

There are approximately 78,000 each year in the UK.

Many patients recover well from a wrist fracture. However, over half may continue to have some degree of chronic pain, and 1 in 5 will develop long-term functional impairment and associated disability. Wrist fractures may affect the person's ability to work, look after themselves, prepare meals and move about confidently. Some patients may become frail and lose their independence.

We want to be able to forecast who will not recover well after a wrist fracture, so that those people can be offered more support and rehabilitation. We plan to analyse data from a large national database of anonymised GP records. This will allow us to look at use of healthcare, such as GP visits and medication use, and health outcomes in a very large number of people (>100,000) over a period of up to 30 years. We will investigate whether people become frail after their wrist fracture, and need more healthcare. The results will help us work out what features or characteristics of patients help to identify those at increased risk of poor long-term outcomes. We will then be able to design a screening tool for clinicians to use with patients who have a wrist fracture to assess who will need extra rehabilitation. Separately to this study, we are carrying out other work with clinicians and patients to design the best rehabilitation package. In the future we can then test the screening tool and the rehabilitation package in a trial.","Each year approximately 78,000 people in the UK aged over 50 experience a fragility fracture of the wrist. Many of these fractures occur in individuals who are functionally independent, active, and with good health-related quality of life. Existing research has largely investigated consequences of wrist fractures in older populations and often with a focus on pain and hand disability, falls and future fractures. Yet, an estimated 20% of patients with wrist fracture are thought to develop functional decline, frailty, with consequent increased use of healthcare.
Understanding the extent and burden of these long-term consequences and the prognostic factors that identify those at high risk is essential to select subgroups likely to benefit from early, targeted interventions.

In order to provide high quality evidence on prognosis and inform the design of future intervention studies, we propose to conduct a study using anonymised medical record data from a large, national primary care database, to investigate the burden and long-term impact of wrist fractures to patients and the NHS. This study will assess: i) long-term consequences in individuals aged >/=50 years, who are often still working at the time of fracture; ii) trajectories towards frailty and increased healthcare use which are essential to inform the long-term primary care management of patients post fracture, and iii) predictors associated with unfavourable outcomes.

Subsequent work will use these findings to design and evaluate a brief screening tool to assess patients at the time of fracture, for use in a future randomised trial evaluating the clinical/cost-effectiveness of targeted interventions for those at risk of poor outcomes.",Decline in function using electronic frailty index (eFI); Healthcare utilization; Complications in primary or secondary care; Non-wrist fragility fracture; All-cause mortality,"Professor Danielle van der Windt - Chief Investigator - Keele University

Benzodiazepines may be prescribed for other things, such as sleep problems. The total number of benzodiazepine prescriptions stayed the same between 2008 and 2012. However, use of these drugs for sleep problems is decreasing, which may mean that the number of prescriptions for anxiety is increasing. However, no data for benzodiazepine use, or any of the other drugs used for anxiety, has been published since 2012.

The number of patients with a new episode defined by a symptom code or a diagnosis code in each calendar year will be calculated.  In addition, the number of patients who received at least one prescription for anxiolytic medication, and the number of patients who started such medication in each calendar year will be calculated. Person-years at risk will be used as the denominator. Incidence rates and 95%CI will be calculated using Poisson regression. Data will be plotted to examine patterns of prescribing over time for all medications combined, and separately by drug class (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, beta blockers). Changes in trends over time will be examined using join point regression. Data will be stratified by age/sex.

It affects people aged over 50 years and is most common in women between the ages of 70 and 80 years. A serious consequence of having GCA can be the sudden development of eyesight problems, which cannot be reversed but can be prevented if treatment is started early. Therefore, it is very important that GCA is identified as quickly as possible when it is suspected. General practitioners (GPs) are generally the first point of contact for healthcare in the UK. However, GCA remains difficult to identify and diagnose; firstly because GCA is a rare condition and secondly, because many symptoms related to GCA are also commonly seen in patients in this age group, for example, headaches. As a result of these factors, the diagnosis of GCA is commonly delayed and as a result, so too is treatment. 
The purpose of this study is to understand whether the number of people with GCA in the UK is changing over time and to identify clinical features and other health conditions which patients see their GP about which may be related to GCA, to help us improve diagnosing patients with GCA quicker, and more accurately.","Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of large/medium vessel vasculitis, typically affecting people over the age of 50 years. If untreated, it can lead to permanent visual loss. Diagnosing GCA is often difficult due to a wide range of non-specific presenting symptoms which can lead to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The overall aim of this study is to estimate the occurrence of GCA, and to identify the most common groups of clinical features presented prior to diagnosis.
Our first objective is to estimate the burden of GCA in the UK population. The annual incidence and prevalence of GCA will be assessed between 1990 and 2017. Trends over time will be modelled using joinpoint regression. Our second objective is to examine the clinical features that patients present with in primary care prior to GCA diagnosis. We will perform a matched case-control study that will identify commonly reported clinical features (symptoms & comorbidities) prior to a GCA diagnosis.

COPD can lead to long lasting breathing problems and even death. One of the main causes of this disease is smoking cigarettes, but the start of COPD can also be caused by other factors, such as dust. There is no cure for this disease, but symptoms (difficulty breathing) can be managed with treatment. Medicines that are inhaled are used to reduce symptoms, improve health status and exercise capacity. Moreover, inhaled medications for COPD reduce the frequency and severity of the difficulty in breathing and thus may decelerate the progression of lung function loss. However, inhaled medications are not effective in all patients and patients may develop side effects despite clinical benefit. We would like to be able to know the people who will benefit from treatment. A blood protein useful identifying these patients is ""creatine reactive protein (CRP)"" These factors can be identified following a simple blood test. People with high levels of these factors in their blood may benefit more from inhaled medicines.
This study will aim to see if this protein (CRP) can help identify which people that will benefit from corticosteroid (ICS; a common medication for COPD) treatment. We will assess the chances of our study outcomes among patients using ICS or not using statistical software called SAS.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a medical condition characterized by enhanced airway inflammation and is known to be responsible for mortality and morbidity of millions of individuals worldwide. C-reactive protein have also been identified to be elevated in patients with COPD exacerbation. Exacerbations of COPD are the primary outcome as these greatly affect a patients' quality of life. The benefits of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to reduce exacerbations have mainly been observed in patients having elevated CRP levels. More recently, a randomized open-label study among COPD patients found that after 6 weeks of treatment with ICS/long-acting beta-2 agonists CRP levels decreased. Therefore, the aim of this study will be to evaluate the risk of moderate-to-severe exacerbations, severe exacerbations and all-cause mortality with among COPD patients currently exposed to ICS stratified by CRP tertiles compared to ICS naive COPD patients with lowest CRP tertile. This study will be a cohort study of COPD patients aged 40 years or more from January 2005 to January 2014. Patients with CRP measurement at baseline will be included in the study. The primary outcome of the study will be a moderate exacerbation (secondary outcomes include: severe exacerbations or death). We will evaluate the risk of study outcomes stratified by ICS exposure.

Mothers of children with a life-limiting condition commonly end up being a coordinator and provider of healthcare for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The health of these mothers is important, both for their own well-being, and for their ability to care for their child. Services for these children within the National Health Service (NHS) and the statutory services rarely provide support for the parents or other family members. Mothers of children with a severe health condition or whose child has died are more likely themselves to die earlier than other mothers; this raises questions about their physical health.
Recent national guidance on End-of-Life care of children and young people from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence highlighted the lack of research assessing the effectiveness of services or interventions to support the psychological health of parents or carers of children with a life-limiting condition.
This programme of research utilises the ability to link mothers and their children's healthcare data in the Clinical Practice Research Dataset (CPRD) dataset. We will describe the types of physical and psychological health conditions diagnosed in mothers of children with a life-limiting condition, the prevalence of depression and anxiety in children and young people with life-limiting conditions, and the impact that treating these condition has on NHS resources.","There are now nearly 50000 children with a life-limiting or life-threatening conditions (LLC) in the UK. These include conditions where there is no reasonable hope of cure and from which they will die, as well as conditions for which curative treatment may be feasible but can fail, e.g. cancer or heart failure. Having a child with a LLC involves being a coordinator and provider of healthcare in addition to the responsibilities and pressures of parenting a child who is expected to die young. This adversely affects the health and wellbeing of these mothers and affects their ability to care for their child, but the extent of the impact is poorly understood. The impact on the mental health of the children with a LLC, and the need for interventions, is also poorly understood.

Research Questions (RQs): 

When compared to mothers of other children (WP1):
1. What is the nature and incidence of mental and physical morbidity in mothers of children with a life-limiting condition? 
2. What is the relationship between the health of the mother and the child's condition? 
3. What are the healthcare resource use for mothers of children with a LLC?

When compared to other children (WP2): 
4. What is the incidence of anxiety and depression in children and young people with a LLC? 
5. What is the impact of maternal mental health on the mental health of the children with a LLC?
6. What clinical and demographic factors are associated with the incidence of anxiety and depression among children and young people with LLCs?
7. What is the healthcare resource use of children with a LLC? 
Analyses : 
Diagnostic codes will be used to identify the children with LLC, and chronic disease and the key outcomes in the CPRD and hospital datasets. Incidence rates and incidence rates ratios will be used to quantify and compare the outcomes between groups with multivariable regression modelling used for the other key RQs.","Workpackage 1: Focus on Mothers

Since 2013 there is a new class of anti-diabetic drugs known as sodium-glucose inhibitors co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-Is) on the market. Use of these drugs reduces body weight. Unfortunately, those SGLT2-Is have also been linked to a potential increase in fracture risk. One of the potential mechanisms could be that the decrease in body weight due to use of SGLT2-Is may increase fracture risk. As low body weight and loss of body weight have been associated with an increased risk of fracture. However, up to date, studies investigating the association between use of SGLT2I-s and fracture risk have not investigated the effect of loss of body weight. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the relation between SGLT2-Is, changes in body weight and risk of fracture.","The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between current use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and fracture risk as compared to current sulphonylurea (SU) use. In addition, we will investigate what the effect of change in BMI is on this association.

We will first create a base study population including all patients who start with metformin only during 1-1-98 and 30-6-2018. From this base population we will select all patients with a first ever prescription of a sulphonylurea (SU), SGLT-2-inhibitor or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4-I) prescription during 1-1-2013 and 30-6-2018. SU use will be the reference group. In addition, we will compare fracture risk between SGLT-2-I use and DPP4-I use. Exposure will be assessed time-dependently, with groups distinguishing between current, and past use. Cox proportional hazard models will be used to derive hazard ratios for the association between use of SGLT-2-Is and fracture risk.

This pain, alongside associated poor function and sleep interference, may reduce effectiveness or receipt of appropriate treatment for other illnesses. This means people with musculoskeletal pain may have extended time in hospital, and increased chance of worse outcomes from hospital stays for other illnesses. The objective of this study is to determine whether having musculoskeletal pain increases time in hospital and leads to worse outcomes after a heart attack or stroke.
We will use information collected within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to hospital data. We will analyse data of around 100,000 patients aged 45 years and over newly diagnosed with heart attack or stroke. These conditions are life-threatening, have a major impact on quality of life, are common reasons for going to hospital, and are of high NHS priority. We will determine whether these patients have previously consulted with a doctor for musculoskeletal pain. We will compare length of hospital stay and risk of worse hospital outcomes such as death between those with pre-existing musculoskeletal pain and those without, after taking into account other illnesses. We will investigate links between musculoskeletal pain and likelihood of going back into hospital within 30 days of discharge. We will examine if findings vary by pain type such as osteoarthritis or back pain, or by age.","The NHS is under pressure with increased rates of hospital admission and delayed transfer of care. In people with other long-term conditions, such as vascular disease, musculoskeletal pain is common but often neglected. Musculoskeletal comorbidity can impact on outcomes if pain, and associated restricted functioning and sleep interference, prevent or delay delivery of appropriate treatment or reduce its effectiveness. It may limit patients' ability to manage another condition at home, extending time to discharge, and worsening outcomes of these other conditions.
The extent to which outcomes from vascular disease are worse for people with pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions in the UK is unknown, although there is some international evidence of worse outcomes after stroke. We aim to understand the extent of association between pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions and outcomes for patients hospitalised for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or stroke. We will analyse data of patients newly diagnosed with ACS or stroke and compare patients with a prior painful musculoskeletal condition requiring health care to patients without such a condition on mortality, length of hospital stay, discharge location, 30-day readmission for any condition, and resource use and costs. Painful musculoskeletal conditions will be identified from primary and secondary care records in the 24-months prior to ACS or stroke.  We will compare outcomes of hospitalisation (mortality, discharge location, readmission) between those with and those without musculoskeletal comorbidity using binary logistic regression. Poisson regression will be used to determine differences in length of stay in hospital. We will include in further models proxies for severity (musculoskeletal referral, analgesia prescription). We will use mixed-effects models to account for clustering by practice. Our findings will allow assessment of the potential for existing evidence-based management of musculoskeletal pain and associated disability to be targeted in these patients to make a substantial impact on outcomes of ACS and stroke.","1: Mortality (during hospitalisation, within 30 days of discharge)

These drugs have been shown to have several beneficial effects, including reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks, and promoting weight loss. However, there were early concerns that these drugs may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. While one hypothesis implicates a biological mechanism for this possible association, a competing hypothesis suggests a possible ""over detection"" of breast cancer by the rapid weight loss induced by these drugs. Indeed, significant weight loss might make it easier to feel a breast lump. It might also induce a behavioural change in some women, resulting in increased screening and detection of breast cancer. While the findings of a previous study supported the over detection hypothesis, it remains unknown whether the weight loss induced by GLP-1 receptor agonists is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Thus, this question will be investigated in a large group of women with type 2 diabetes identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.","The use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in the treatment of type 2 diabetes has markedly increased over the years, in part due to their favourable effects on cardiovascular outcomes. However, their association with breast cancer risk became a safety concern when they were initially introduced. Indeed, there were imbalances in breast cancer events with the GLP-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, in premarketing trials which were typically of short duration. In contrast, this imbalance was no longer observed in the large LEADER trial of liraglutide that followed patients over a three-year period. While one hypothesis for these contradictory findings implicates a possible tumour promoting effect, another hypothesis implicates the rapid weight loss induced by GLP-1 agonists leading to a transient increased detection of breast cancers. Specifically, it has been shown that obese women are significantly less likely to undergo mammography screening or breast examination than women of normal weight. Thus, the rapid weight loss induced by GLP-1 receptor agonist may lead to a better detection of breast lumps and to an increased frequency and accuracy of screening. While the association between GLP-1 receptor agonists and breast cancer has been previously investigated in one observational study, it remains unclear whether the weight loss induced by these drugs has an effect on breast cancer incidence. To address this question, we will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to assemble a cohort of women who initiated antidiabetic drugs between January 1 2007 and December 31 2017, with follow-up until December 31 2018. Time dependent Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of breast cancer, comparing GLP-1 receptor agonist maximal weight loss (<5%, 5%-10%, >10%) with dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors.

Episodes when the disease suddenly becomes worse (exacerbations) are critical events in a person's history of COPD. These events worsen quality of life and lung function and increase the probability of death. Within UK general practice, around a quarter of COPD patients have very stable disease over time, without any exacerbations up to ten years. We think that COPD patients without these exacerbations are a specific group, and we want to find out what characterises them so that we can better understand how to determine which patients are at higher risk so that they can be managed.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has proven to be a heterogeneous disease with regard to symptoms, radiological findings, type of inflammatory response, response to inhaled corticosteroids and comorbidities. However, it is especially the frequency and severity of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), which shapes lung function trajectories and survival. 

Recent data points at a large subgroup of COPD patients less susceptible to exacerbation, and this trait appears to be stable over time for periods as long as ten years. Little is known about the nature of this non-exacerbating phenotype even though one out of four COPD patients seems to belong to this category. 

Our design will include as a first part a cross sectional study describing the clinical characteristics of non-exacerbating COPD patients, such as general demographics, degree of dyspnoea, severity of obstruction by spirometry, smoking history, medication, previous or concomitant other lung diseases and other comorbidities. We will then conduct a historical cohort study aiming at comparing mortality rates between non-exacerbating and exacerbating COPD patients as well as causes of death in both groups. Non-exacerbating COPD patients will be defined through a baseline period of three years after inclusion, with no exacerbation during this time. Cox proportional hazards regression will be used. As primary care is the management setting for most COPD patients, the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD) should be a representative source of data for our study.","1.

Many individuals who end up having these diseases have a very high chance of having another event, which could be fatal. Previous studies have developed ways to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of developing these conditions in the future. However, few studies have developed methods to aid clinicians to manage people who already have these disease conditions and are at high risk of having severe complications.
Defining patients will help clinicians manage patients with more severe forms of heart/blood vessel diseases to prevent these conditions from reoccurring. Improvements in electronic patient record quality and advanced analytic methods now available, make it more efficient to develop more accurate ways of defining characteristics and understanding the underlying causes of heart/blood vessel diseases in these patients. This might eventually help to tailor and target early treatment and interventions to patients who would most likely benefit. 
Using electronic patient records from general practices across the UK, this study aims to define characteristics of these patients who are most likely to have the greatest complications of these conditions.","Background: Prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) requires timely identification of people at increased risk to target effective interventions. With advances in diagnosis and treatment of CVD and increasing life expectancy, more people are surviving initial CVD events, and secondary prevention risk prediction models are increasingly being utilised. A refined classification of CVD by disease severity could provide a novel tool to identify individuals with increased risk of severe disease and individualise management.

Aim: To develop and validate a novel clinical severity index for CVD severity risk classification in adults with an established CVD.

Study design: Retrospective open cohort 

Setting: UK General Practices

Participants: Patients aged 18 years and over, with a first diagnosis of incident non-fatal CVD.

Methods: Use a data driven cluster analysis in patients with newly diagnosed CVD to determine patient clusters based on potential risk factors for severe CVD outcomes. This will be related to retrospective data from patient records on development of severe CVD complications or outcomes. Cox and competing-risk regressions will be used to compare risk of severe CVD complications/outcomes among clusters.

Outputs: A novel risk severity tool built from data-driven methods for use in primary care, aimed at secondary prevention of CVD. The clinical decision tool would sub-stratify patients based on risk of severe CVD outcomes.
The tool will eventually help to tailor and target early treatment to patients who would benefit most from the respective effective interventions that already exist, thereby representing a first step towards personalised medicine in secondary prevent of CVD.","The health-related outcomes that are expected to be assessed are:

This research aims to answer four questions: 1) how common is osteoarthritis in the UK and what are the trends over the past twenty years; 2) are people with osteoarthritis more likely to have other long-term conditions than people without osteoarthritis; 3) which long-term conditions are more likely to co-exist with osteoarthritis and how do they progress with time; and 4) does the presence of long-term conditions in osteoarthritis add to the  burden both to patients and to health services.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic condition that has significant detrimental impact on daily activities and quality of life. There is lack of evidence on the association and/or causal relationship of OA with other chronic diseases (comorbidities) such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Presence of comorbidities affects management and outcome of OA in several ways. For example, some treatments (e.g. systemic analgesics) may add a further burden to the comorbidity, whereas others (e.g. exercise and weight loss) may benefit both OA and its comorbidities. This project aims to examine the trends, patterns and healthcare utilisation of OA and its comorbidities in the past 20 years in the UK using the Clinical Practice Research Data-link (CPRD). Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) will be used to determine hospitalisation. Office of National Statistics (ONS) death registration data will be used to map the death registration. Multiple deprivation index data will be used to explore the association with social factors. Trends of age-sex standardized incidence and prevalence of OA (and by body region) will be calculated for the last 20 years (1997-2017). 

We will determine incident OA cases according to the first diagnosis date (index date) and match each case with a non-OA (control) by age, gender and practice on a 1:1 basis with the same index date being allocated. We will retrospectively review comorbidities diagnosed prior to the index date and follow up at-risk OA cases and matched controls for incident comorbidities after the index date. The clusters of comorbidities will be examined for differences in pattern, trajectories, health utilisation and mortality. For the retrospective study, conditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios, and for the follow-up prospective study Cox-proportional hazard regression will be used to estimate the hazard ratios.","Primary outcome: association between OA and comorbidities

These complications can lead to disease in the most peripheral nerves, which alongside disease in the arterial blood vessels can lead to diabetic foot ulcers. Such ulcers often precede amputations, are associated with immobilization, impaired quality of life (QoL), and even increase the risk of early death. Much is already known about the risk factors for developing diabetic foot ulcers, but even in high-risk populations, the overall number of events each year is reported to be quite limited.

In this study, we want to investigate the trend in development of diabetic foot ulcers over time. Furthermore, we will describe these trends for several subgroups including people with type I and type II diabetes.","In CPRD, all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes will be included in the initial study cohort. 

Our primary outcome will be trends in incidence of first Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU).
Patients will be followed from the index date up to the date of death, end of data collection, end of study period, or the date of a DFU, whichever comes first. DFUs will be identified by use of read codes.

The incidence rates in each calendar year will be calculated as the sum of the DFUs in that year divided by the total time at risk in that given calendar year. This will be expressed as the number of events per 1000 person-years. We will break down these rates by gender, age categories, and type of diabetes (T1DM or T2DM). 

Furthermore, the following patient characteristics at the time of the first DFU will be determined, age, time since index date as a proxy for diabetes duration and history of Charcot Neuroarthropathy (CN).

For patients with a diagnosis of a DFU we will also calculate the 1- and 5-year mortality rates.

All analyses will be stratified by sex, age categories and type of diabetes (T1DM and T2DM).","1) Trends in incidence of first DFU and hospitalization for first DFU

Many doctors and scientists speculate that the lung inflammation that occurs in asthma increases a patient's risk of developing heart disease such as a heart attack. Some studies have suggested that there is an association between asthma and heart disease, while others studies suggest that this association is only in those asthma patients that smoke, in patients that developed asthma as an adult, or in those with asthma caused by allergies. The differences in results may be because different populations have different risks or because previous studies have limitations in the way the study was carried out.
 
Recently a study looking at patients with a similar lung disease to asthma, but unlike asthma as it is caused by smoking (called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD), found that certain inhaled treatments (long-acting bronchodilators) increase the risk of heart disease in a COPD population in Taiwan. These inhalers are also commonly used in asthma patients but no one has looked at the possible side-effects to the heart in asthma patients. We would like to look in a large UK nationwide population of asthma patients to see if they do have an increased risk of heart disease and if certain patients are at higher risk than others. As a comparison, we would also like to see if these inhalers increase the risk of heart disease in COPD patients in a UK population, as was found in the Taiwan population.","To determine the risk of cardiovascular disease in a general asthma cohort, annual incidence and prevalence rates will be calculated for each cardiovascular outcome (including ischaemic heart disease, heart failure and stroke) and stratified by clinical characteristics between 2004 and 2017. To compare CVD incidence and mortality rates to the general population a matched cohort of asthma patients and randomly identified patients from the total CPRD population will be obtained from CPRD between 2012 and 2017. A multivariate Poisson model, adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, will be used to obtain rate ratios. 

To determine any cardiovascular risk from incident long-acting bronchodilators (LAB) a nested case-control will be carried out from a cohort of incident LAB users. The cases will be acute cardiovascular events and controls will be matched 1:4 on disease risk score and cohort entry date.  Conditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association. Exposure (long acting bronchodilator) will be categorised by type of inhaler and duration of use. The same analysis will also be carried out in a COPD population to see if the findings in a UK population match those found in the Taiwanese population used in the original study.","1.

Severe asthma is not very common but contributes around 50% of costs related to asthma. More research is needed to understand the true burden of severe asthma in the UK. This study will determine new asthma patients and describe their treatment journey to severe asthma. We will also describe the profile of these patients and assess the health services they use.,"Severe asthma typically refers to asthma that remains uncontrolled despite treatment with routine asthma medications such as inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Whilst severe asthma affects around only 5% of all patients with asthma, it is responsible for approximately 50% of the economic costs attributable to the disease, representing a severe economic burden. In addition, patients with severe asthma suffer a serious reduction in quality of life; patients have frequent Accident & Emergency (A&E) visits and are often unable to work or go to school as a result of their condition. Using a cohort of asthma patients, we will examine the treatment pathways for asthma patients to their severe asthma diagnosis and describe health care resource utilisation including referrals through to severe asthma.

The variability of medications in terms of effectiveness both across individuals and within an individual over time is, for the most part, poorly understood. This research project proposes to use electronic health records to discover adaptive treatment strategies that tailor treatment decisions to patient characteristics such as demographic characteristics, concurrent health problems, and response to previous treatments. Our work will serve to identify patient characteristics that can be used to tailor therapies so that patients receive the treatments most likely to confer the greatest benefit. Furthermore, we will compare tailored treatment strategies estimated from two different sources: one which is drawn from a general population and thus is likely to be applicable to a wider patient group and another drawn from a more selected population of Americans with health insurance, to see whether the estimated strategies are similar. If they are indeed similar, it would allow us to draw conclusions for a wider population based on the second dataset, which has more detailed information available and thus might permit even more individualized treatment strategies to be formed.","People experiencing depression and those who care for them are often faced with many treatment options and insufficient information for how to choose the best treatment. This research project proposes to discover adaptive treatment strategies (ATSs) that tailor treatment decisions to patient characteristics such as demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and response to previous treatments. The aims of this retrospective cohort study are to (1) estimate a tailored pharmaco-therapeutic treatment strategy for depression that adapts to patient-specific variables, and (2) compare the estimated strategy with one derived from the Mental Health Research Network, which includes longitudinal, patient-reported depression symptoms but is less representative sample to assess the validity and generalizability of the latter sample.
     The analyses for aims (1) and (2) will estimate the ATS that reduces the risk of treatment failure, defined as the composite of self-harm, suicide, or hospitalization for depression. First-line treatments considered will be an antidepressant that is either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, a third-generation antidepressant, or a tricyclic. For individuals not responding to the initial treatment, second-line treatments considered will be switching to a different medication in the same class, or in a different class. Estimation will be by Q-learning and its more robust counterpart, dynamic weighted ordinary least squares.
     To undertake aim (2), comparisons between estimated rules will be taken both qualitatively (examining whether the same tailoring variables are used in both cohorts, evaluating the similarity of treatment decision thresholds) and quantitatively, by simple statistical metrics such as Cochran's Q test, a non-parametric test of concordance to assess whether the recommended treatments from each estimated rule differs within the sample.

Patients diagnosed with MDD consistently experience at least five symptoms from a list. When the first two types of antidepressant treatment given to a patient with MDD are not adequately effective, the patient is considered to have Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). 
Many forms of therapy exist for MDD including drugs (e.g. anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anticonvulsants), procedures (e.g. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)) and therapies which do not involve drugs (e.g. psychotherapy, occupational therapy). However, the range of therapies currently available remain unsatisfactory for a large number of patients. Therefore, a need exists for new treatments with improved effectiveness.  
The objective of this study is to describe characteristics of the MDD and TRD patient populations of the UK, to explore the treatments currently taken by patients in the UK, and to describe the cost of managing and treating patients in the UK. This will help to explore how a new and more effective treatment might be beneficial in the UK. 
To achieve these objectives, data from patients who were diagnosed with MDD between January 2011 and May 2015 will be used from diagnosis to the point at which data is no longer available (2017).","This study aims to better understand the epidemiology and pharmacoeconomics of MDD and TRD, and the current treatment pathways used in the treatment of these conditions in the UK, which will in turn allow Janssen to ascertain whether there is a specific unmet need within these patient groups regarding the treatment options currently available, and thus highlighting the need for new treatments. The results of this study will also be used to inform a submission to a UK Health Technology Assessment (HTA) body to determine the relevance of currently-available comparators.
Methods:
To address the study objectives, a retrospective, longitudinal cohort design will be employed in incident MDD patients identified between January 2011 and May 2015 using linked CPRD-HES-MHDS data. Patients will be indexed on the date of first AD prescription within the indexing period and all indexed patients will be followed up for a minimum of 180 days, with the exception of those who die in the 180 days following indexing. Linked CPRD-HES data will be used to address all objectives. Linked CPRD-HES data will be used in conjunction with MHDS data to describe the use of non-pharmacological treatments. 
Data analysis:
All analyses will be predominantly descriptive in nature, with all outcomes reported using appropriate descriptive statistics. Statistical testing will be utilised between subgroups, where applicable, in addition to Kaplan-Meier estimates (for time-to-event analyses) and generalised linear models (for regression modelling). Analyses pertaining to the primary and secondary objectives will include estimation of incidence of MDD and TRD, description of treatment pathways and treatment outcomes at each line of therapy and description of baseline demographics and clinical characteristics.

Therapy failure, however, is common: up to 57% discontinues thiopurine therapy, due to either side effects or lack of desired effect. Some of these side effects are potentially fatal and include liver damage, decrease in blood cell counts and inflammation of the pancreas. 

Allopurinol might reduce these side effects of thiopurines, by channelling conversion of thiopurines towards the effective compounds, rather than the toxic ones. Studies have demonstrated that - with the addition of allopurinol - toxic thiopurine compounds were indeed lowered with 94%, while levels of beneficial compounds were increased. Hence, in clinical practice, some physicians start the use of allopurinol accompanied with a reduced thiopurine dose (by 50-75%) in patients with a proven thiopurine conversion towards toxic compounds.  

Despite these data on this beneficial interaction between thiopurines and allopurinol, evidence on clinical endpoints is limited. Some of the studies observed a decreasing trend of liver damage but had not enough patients to study this association more carefully. Moreover, other side effects, such as lowered blood cell counts and pancreas damage, have not been thoroughly studied. Finally, the majority of these studies had a relatively short time window of follow-up.
 
The objectives of this study are therefore, firstly, to evaluate the rates of liver damage, and, secondary, to assess decrease in blood cell counts and pancreas damage in adult and children thiopurine users with or without allopurinol.","Thiopurines are important in the treatment of IBD, but therapy failure is a common clinical phenomenon. Up to 57% discontinues thiopurine therapy, due to either adverse events or limited clinical response. Some of these adverse events are potentially fatal and include hepatotoxicity, myelotoxicity and pancreatitis. (1-5)(1-5)

Allopurinol might enhance the risk-benefit ratio of thiopurines. Mechanistically, allopurinol promotes metabolism of thiopurines towards beneficial 6-thioguanine metabolites (6-TGN) rather than the assumed hepatotoxic 6-methylmercaptopurine metabolites (6-MMP). Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the addition of allopurinol indeed effectively lowers 6-MMP concentrations by 94%, at the cost of increases in 6-TGN concentrations. Based on this mechanism, various IBD guidelines advocate the use of allopurinol, in adjunction with a reduced thiopurine dose (by 50-75%) in patients with skewed thiopurine metabolism. 

Evidence on clinical endpoints (rather than pharmacokinetic evidence) on the addition of allopurinol is scarce. Some of the pharmacokinetic studies observed a decreasing trend in hepatotoxicity, but were not powered to study this association more carefully. Moreover, the impact on other toxicity parameters (e.g. pancreatitis) has not been thoroughly studied. Finally, the majority of these studies had a relatively short follow-up time window. 

The objectives of this study are therefore to primarily evaluate the rates of hepatotoxicity, and secondary to assess rates of myelotoxicity and pancreas toxicity in adult and paediatrics thiopurine users with or without allopurinol.

Rate ratios for hepatotoxicity, myelotoxicity and pancreas toxicity will be calculated among allopurinol-thiopurine co-users versus thiopurine-monotherapy users. For this purpose, time-dependent cox proportional hazards models will be used, adjusted for potential confounders using propensity scores. All analyses will be stratified based on the defined azathioprine dose reduction category, age, gender and - where relevant - potential effect modifiers. Statistical interaction will be tested using Wald tests.","Our primary outcome will be hepatotoxicity.

Previous studies showed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) might increase the risk of broken bone, non-fusion broken bone, and joint replacement. In contrast, other studies concluded that NSAIDs did not affect the contact between bone and artificial materials implanted into joints, and the movement of these materials after hip replacement (HR). Only a few studies investigated the association between NSAIDs and the risk of revision surgery for specific joints namely HR and knee replacement (KR). Thus, we aim to investigate the risk of revision surgery for LJR, i.e., HR and KR for NSAID users and to evaluate whether the duration of NSAID use, different sub-groups of NSAID (either conventional NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors), and joint replaced (either knee or hip) lead to different risk of revision surgery.

For NSAID users, they might also be defined as ""non-users"" if a total duration of either single or consecutive prescription of any NSAIDs were <3 weeks, or if they have no NSAID prescription following past use, or during a 3-week period following primary LJR. We will stratify our analyses based on the sub-groups of NSAIDs, the duration of current NSAID use, and joint replaced. The outcome will be the revision of LJR. We will consider age, sex, body mass index (BMI), co-medications, co-morbidities, and lifestyle factors as potential confounders. The risk of revision of LJR for NSAID use will be estimated by using Cox proportional hazard with time-dependent covariates.

It can roughly be divided into two major groups: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In the UK the majority of lung cancer patients experience a form of NSCLC. 

In early stages, surgery is the primary treatment option. However, if the tumour has spread, surgery is often no longer possible. In that case systemic treatment, a drug given orally or intravenously that spreads through the whole body, becomes the primary treatment option. Previously, chemotherapy was the only systemic treatment available for those patients. In the last decade, several new treatment options have become available, such as targeted therapies (for example alectinib or osimertinib) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ifor example nivolumab or pembrolizumab). In patients with more developed NSCLC (higher stages) those therapies have become first-line treatment options and are extensively used in the clinical practice.

New drugs are evaluated in clinical trials. Before inclusion, patients are screened based on their characteristics and their comorbidities (inclusion- and exclusion-criteria). Comorbidities are other conditions that occur simultaneously with the condition of interest. Those criteria used for screening of the patients could lead to differences between the patients included in the study and NSCLC-patients in clinical practice. 

The aim of this study is to describe characteristics and comorbidities of British lung cancer patients and to evaluate the representativeness of recently performed, clinical trials evaluating targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer patients.","Primary objective is to compare the characteristics of patients included in phase III randomized clinical trials that evaluated targeted therapies or immunotherapy for treatment of lung cancer with the characteristics of patients with lung cancer in CPRD from 2014 through 2018. 
Secondary objective is to compare overall survival among patients with lung cancer in CPRD (2014-2018) who were eligible for inclusion in phase III RCTs that evaluated targeted therapies or immunotherapy for treatment of lung cancer with those in CPRD who did not meet those eligibility criteria.
First, we will create a base study population including all patients with any diagnosis of lung cancer between 01-01-2014 and 31-12-2018. The comorbidities of the included patients will be described, and subsequently the included patients will be compared based on their characteristics, with the study population of different clinical trials. This will enable us to evaluate which proportion of UK lung cancer patients would be eligible to participate in one of the clinical trials, thereby defining the representativeness of the included study population in the clinical trials. In addition to representativeness, for all lung cancer patients in CPRD, Kaplan-Meier analyses will compare overall survival between those who met eligibility criteria for each individual RCT versus those did not meet eligibility criteria. Corresponding Kaplan-Meier curves will compare overall survival in CPRD patients whose characteristics made them eligible or ineligible for inclusion in published RCTs. In addition, Cox proportional hazards analyses will estimate crude and age-sex adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of overall survival of patients with lung cancer, comparing patients who were eligible for participation in RCTs  to those who were not.",Overall survival,"Professor Frank de Vries - Chief Investigator - Utrecht University

1616634023-2477,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=11,"The association between fracture risk and diabetes duration, complications and regulation in diabetes mellitus","Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease, wherein the regulation of the blood sugar (glucose) level is disturbed resulting in high glucose levels. On the long-term patients with DM might develop microvascular complications such as; eye damage (retinopathy), kidney damage (nephropathy), and nerve damage (neuropathy). DM patients may also have an increased fracture risk due to bone deterioration or fall risk. Current studies focus on the question whether fracture risk in patients with DM is increased compared to people without DM. Results of these studies differ and most studies only focus on all fractures or on one specific fracture type. Therefore, it is not clear which fracture types are more common in DM. Fracture risk might also differ between patients with DM. Some studies suggested that patients with a long DM duration, with diabetic complications or poor DM regulation have an increased fracture risk compared to patients with a shorter DM duration, without complications or healthy blood glucose levels. However, the results of these previous studies are not concordant and difficult to compare due to different study designs. Obtaining this information is important to better understand if and why fracture risk is increased and inform preventative strategies. Therefore, the aim of our study is first to determine whether fracture risk is increased for specific fracture types in patients with either type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or  type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to people without DM. Secondly, we will determine whether a long DM duration, DM complications and a poor DM regulation increase fracture risk in DM.","The objective of this study is to determine whether fracture risk is increased in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared to matched controls, broken down by fracture type and to identify risk factors per fracture type. In addition, we will investigate diabetes specific risk factors within patients with DM. 

The study population will consist of all patients with diabetes within the full CPRD cohort. Diabetes will be identified by a prescription for an insulin, or a non-insulin anti-diabetic drug (NIAD). The date of the prescription will define the index date. In order to identify incident diabetics, patients will need to have at least one year of valid data collection before the index date. Patients with diabetes will be matched by year of birth, sex and practice to 1 control patient without diabetes, using incidence density sampling. Control patients will be assigned the index date of their matched control. The study period for this study will be 1987 - 2017.

Cox regression will be used to compare fracture risk in patients with DM (T1DM/T2DM) to healthy controls. For each fracture type we will investigate what potential risk factors are. We identified these possible risk factors based on literature and we will use them as potential confounders. We will also do this for T1DM and T2DM separately. Within the DM cohort we will investigate whether  regulation of DM, presence of complications and duration of DM are specific risk factors for the different fracture types. 
For aim 1 the following confounders are considered:
Age, Charlson comorbidity index, A history of: fall and hypoglycaemia related hospitalizations and use of the following drugs in de 6 months before an interval:
anti-epileptics, oral glucocorticoids, antidepressants, anxiolytics or hypnotics, antipsychotics,
anti-Parkinson drugs, opposed hormone replacement therapy, calcium, bisphosphonates, vitamin D, raloxifene, strontium ranelate, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone.

When our immune system is weakened through illness or age, the virus can reactivate to cause shingles. 

The chickenpox vaccine is not part of routine childhood vaccination in the United Kingdom. This is because there are concerns that removing chickenpox from the population through vaccinating children would cause adults to get shingles. Adults with prior chickenpox exposed to children with chickenpox are thought to have their immunity boosted, therefore reducing their risk of shingles. However, the magnitude of this boosting effect is poorly understood.

The objective of this research is to carry out a study using UK healthcare data to estimate the extent to which exposure to children with chickenpox reduces an adult's risk of developing shingles.","Varicella is a common childhood infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). After primary VZV infection, the virus remains in the body and zoster is caused by the reactivation of VZV, typically in late-life. The varicella vaccine is not recommended in the United Kingdom, due to concerns that removing varicella contacts from the population through immunisation would lead to an outbreak of zoster cases in adults. Adults exposed to varicella contacts are thought to have their VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity boosted and therefore their risk of zoster reduced.  However, the magnitude of this exogenous boosting effect is poorly understood.  

In countries which universally vaccinate children against varicella, such as the United States, there has been a gradual increase in the rate of zoster since its introduction. However, the dramatic increases in the rate of zoster, as predicted by many modelling studies, have not been observed. This has led some commentators to question whether VZV-boosting from exposure to varicella contacts is as significant as previously thought. 

This study will use data from the UK to explore the association between having a household member with varicella and the subsequent risk of zoster. Within-person comparisons will be undertaken using the self-controlled case-series method. Participants will have a first-ever diagnosis of zoster and a household member with varicella within the study period. Zoster incidence in periods following varicella exposure will be compared with incidence in other time periods, using conditional Poisson Regression. Age-adjusted incidence ratios (IRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated.",Herpes zoster,"Dr Harriet Forbes - Chief Investigator - London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM )

1616634055-2491,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=11,Inflammatory Skin Diseases and the Risk of Chronic Kidney Disease - Cross-sectional and Cohort Studies,"Chronic kidney disease is common with one in ten people affected. It often has no symptoms until late in the disease process (kidney failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation), with resulting poor quality of life and increased risk of death. Diabetes and high blood pressure are well-established risk factors for kidney disease, but the full reasons for developing chronic kidney disease are not completely understood. Emerging evidence suggests that there may be a link between chronic inflammation and kidney damage, and inflammation might cause kidney disease. Chronic inflammation is also a feature of several common non-infectious skin diseases (e.g. atopic eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, hidradenitis suppurativa). Recent work suggests a possible association between more common inflammatory skin diseases and kidney disease, but the size and nature of this association remain unclear. We plan to investigate and quantify the association between chronic kidney disease and inflammatory skin diseases in the general population. To understand the timing of events, we will also examine the association of chronic kidney disease with atopic eczema and psoriasis, specifically among people with diabetes. Patients with diabetes undergo periodic blood testing for kidney function, so the occurrence of new kidney disease can be reliably detected. Exploring and highlighting the potential role of skin diseases as possible risk-factors or markers for kidney disease could be important for defining at-risk populations who might benefit from regular kidney function monitoring, guiding judicial use of drugs that could cause kidney problems among patients with skin conditions, and help us understand why kidney disease occurs.","We aim to explore the association between CKD and common non-communicable inflammatory skin diseases (i.e. atopic eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, hidradenitis suppurativa). The diagnosis of CKD requires evidence of an abnormally low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), but creatinine tests are not routinely offered or performed for everybody. However, we have shown that prevalent cases of CKD can be reliably ascertained through pooling accumulated test results over several years. Incident CKD can be accurately detected in at-risk populations, like those with diabetes, who undergo regular routine kidney function monitoring. We, therefore, plan to address our research question through two complementary study designs (1. prevalent case-control; 2. cohort) allowing us to assess both the magnitude and the temporal direction of the association between inflammatory skin diseases and CKD. We will define our main outcome, CKD, based on two consecutive reduced eGFR measurements, and we will apply previously validated algorithms where available to detect inflammatory skin diseases (i.e. the exposures). Initially, we will include all CPRD patients with prevalent CKD in March 2018 (each matched on GP practice, age and sex with up to 5 individuals without CKD) in a case-control analysis. We will fit conditional logistic regression models to compare the prevalence CKD among individuals with and without inflammatory skin diseases, and multinomial regression models to assess the association by CKD stage. Subsequently, we will conduct a cohort analysis, including all individuals in CPRD with diabetes (2004-2018). We will fit Poisson regression models to compare the rate of incident CKD among patients with and without atopic eczema and psoriasis. We will consider various lifestyle variables, medications, and recognised risk factors of CKD as potential confounders and/or mediators, and will employ a purposeful hierarchical approach to model building for a-priori covariate selection.","Primary: Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
Secondary: CKD stage and renal replacement therapy (RRT) 

Overall we aim to explore the link between skin disease (exposure: atopic eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, and hidradenitis suppurativa) and kidney disease (outcome). However in practice, in Study A (case-control study) the exposure/outcome will be reversed, with CKD as exposure, and outcome as skin disease, while in Study B (cohort study) the exposure will be skin disease and the outcome(s) kidney disease.","Professor Dorothea Nitsch - Chief Investigator - London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM )

Levothyroxine is used to treat overt hypothyroidism based on previous studies supporting a higher risk of pregnancy complications (both for the mother and baby) in these women. However, the benefit of levothyroxine for SCH in pregnant women is less clear.  Despite a lack of firm evidence, current recommendations suggest that women start treatment with levothyroxine at the time of SCH diagnosis. Thus, there is a need to determine the effectiveness and safety of levothyroxine in pregnant women with SCH.  

Our study will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to compare the chances of having a pregnancy complication between patients who use levothyroxine and those who do not. The main outcomes that we will study include maternal and fetal complications, such as diabetes and hypertension during pregnancy, blood loss during delivery, maternal death, preterm birth, small birth weight, and fetal death. 

If we find that levothyroxine reduces the risk of pregnancy complications, our study will provide reassurance regarding the effectiveness of this drug in pregnancy. Given the increasing rates of SCH in pregnancy, this study will have important policy, clinical, and public health implications.","We will conduct a population-based cohort study including women aged 15 to 45 with a first recorded pregnancy in the CPRD Pregnancy Registry between April 1, 2000 to March 31, 2018 with a diagnosis of SCH or an abnormal TSH (<10mlU/L) value. Our primary objective will be to compare the rate of a composite of pregnancy loss and stillbirth in women with SCH using levothyroxine to that in women with SCH not using levothyroxine.  The secondary objectives are to describe the use of levothyroxine and to examine the rates of pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, gestational diabetes, maternal death, neonatal death, placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, pregnancy loss, preterm birth, small-for-gestational age, or stillbirth in women with SCH using levothyroxine to those in women with SCH not using levothyroxine and to examine if the association varies by timing of initiation, dose, and duration of use of levothyroxine during pregnancy. In our primary analysis, we will estimate the cumulative incidence proportion of our composite outcome using a pooled logistic regression analysis including a high-dimensional propensity score to adjust for known and unknown confounders. In our secondary analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazards models with a time-dependent exposure definition.","Primary outcome: pregnancy loss and stillbirth

Secondary outcomes: hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, gestational diabetes, maternal death (during pregnancy or within 30 days of delivery or documented to be related to pregnancy), neonatal death (<30 days of delivery), placental abruption (premature separation of placenta from uterus after 20 weeks' gestation), postpartum hemorrhage (>/=500 mL of blood loss in the 6-week postpartum period), preterm birth (onset of labor and cervical dilation <37 weeks' gestation), or small-for-gestational age (<5th percentile).","Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

After metformin, treatment decisions about other medications are generally based on the physician's choice. However, considerations may be based on the potential of risk of side effects from medication use. Newer medications (GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors) have entered the market and their potential, particularly in combination with each other, has not be extensively explored but could offer greater benefits in terms of diabetes management and lower risk of serious diabetes-related complications including heart disease.

In recent clinical trials, the combination of an SGLT-2 inhibitor and GLP-1 receptor agonist was shown to have additive effects on lowering blood glucose levels, blood pressure and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. The effect of the combination of these two medication classes on adverse effects in routine health care settings is not currently known. We will study the effects of an SGLT-2 inhibitor antidiabetic medication regimen, GLP-1 receptor agonist antidiabetic medication regimen and combination regimen of a SGLT-2 inhibitor and GLP-1 receptor agonist, compared to other combination regimens on the adverse event risk in people with type 2 diabetes.","Maintaining glycaemic control is an integral part of managing type 2 diabetes and often requires pharmacological agents to achieve this. With newer drugs entering the market it is important to assess the safety and efficacy of these drugs used alone and in combination and to establish their place in the treatment algorithm for guiding clinical decision making. The proposed study will examine the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitor regimens, GLP-1 receptor agonist regimens and combined SGLT-2 inhibitor/GLP-1 receptor agonist regimens on risk of major cardiovascular events, osteoporotic fractures, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Data will be obtained from three databases; CPRD GOLD, CPRD Aurum and the SAIL Databank (routinely-collected health care records from Wales), with a common protocol applied across the databases for cohort construction and analysis. The study populations will consist of any individual initiating a non-insulin antidiabetic drug up to 31 January 2018, with follow-up until 31 July 2018. In a nested case-control design, those who experience the outcome of interest will be matched to those who have not experienced the outcome at the time of the case event. Up to 20 controls will be randomly selected for each case and matched on the basis of sex, age, date of study cohort entry, and duration of treated diabetes. Cohorts will be built separately for each outcome. Odds ratios for the outcomes of interest among patients receiving SGLT-2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 receptor agonists, as compared with those receiving other antidiabetic combination regimens, will be estimated from conditional logistic regression models and pooled across the three databases with the use of random-effects models. To investigate risks associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists, a new-user cohort design will be implemented. Weighted Cox regression models will be used to estimate study-specific hazard ratios and pooled across the three databases.","Study 1

Osteoporosis commonly known as ""brittle bones"" and osteoporotic (OP) fractures are one of those complications, which are very dangerous and deadly. There are several factors that play a part in the raised risk of OP fractures in RA including the medicine that RA patients use. 
Perhaps, the most important drugs in RA with a role in osteoporosis are oral glucocorticoids (GCs). Still, RA patients take other drugs that could also affect bones; they are prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as pain-killers and as these drugs could develop stomach upset and peptic ulcer, other medication such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) do normally accompany them to reduce the stomach acidity and the chance of having peptic ulcer. Previous studies showed that PPIs could also increase the risk of an OP fracture. 
But to date, there is no study that considers use of both GCs and PPIs together and fracture risk in RA patients. Thus, in this study we examine the association between use of both GCs and PPIs together and the risk of fracture among patients with RA in the UK. Also, we examine the use of GCs and PPIs separately and different doses of GCs and PPIs and its effect on OP fracture risk, and among various OP fracture sites such as hip, vertebrae, humerus, forearm, pelvis, and rib.","Objectives: To investigate the association between concomitant use of glucocorticoids (GCs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and the risk of fracture among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 

Design: Retrospective cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).

Participants: All adults aged 50 years and older diagnosed with RA in CPRD between 1997 and 2017. The ""index date"" will be the RA diagnosis, recorded as the first read code for RA during valid data collection.

Primary exposure: There will be two primary exposures of interest in this study. First, the use of oral GCs, and secondly, the use of PPIs. Exposure to treatment will be assessed time-dependently, and in 30-day follow-up periods.

Outcome: The outcome in our study is occurrence of the first incident osteoporotic (OP) fracture in RA patients after the index date, which include hip/femur, clinical symptomatic vertebral, humerus, forearm, pelvic, and rib fractures.

Statistical analyses: Cox proportional-hazards models will be used to conduct the statistical analysis. The first and main analysis will compare the OP fracture risk between RA patients who are current users of both GCs and PPIs, and RA patients who take neither of them. Separate analyses will be conducted for various OP fracture sites. Also, the only use of either of these medications, i.e. GCs, or PPIs, will be compared to the control group, in order to estimate the fracture risk of any of these drugs, individually. Furthermore, recent and past use of either of these drugs will be compared to non-use. The secondary analysis will focus on average daily and cumulative dose of current GC and average daily dose and duration of current PPI use in RA patients and will be compared to non-use of both drugs. All calculations will be adjusted for the potential confounders.","Occurrence of an osteoporotic fracture, including hip/femur, clinical symptomatic vertebral, humerus, forearm, pelvic, and rib fractures.","Professor Frank de Vries - Chief Investigator - Utrecht University

Examples of pneumococcal disease include community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis. While healthy adults are at risk of developing pneumococcal disease, adults with chronic conditions such as diabetes, chronic heart failure, and chronic liver disease are at greater risk of developing the disease due to a weakened immune system. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was recommended for individuals with medical conditions in 1992. Data from 2009 show that most adults are not being vaccinated with the vaccine (only 34.4% received the vaccine in 2009). To our knowledge, the proportion of adults with chronic conditions who have been vaccinated for pneumococcal disease is unknown. We propose to estimate the risk of adults with chronic conditions developing pneumococcal diseases, the associated costs, and determine the percentage of adults with chronic conditions who received the pneumococcal vaccination.","The risk of pneumococcal disease in individuals with underlying medical conditions is not well characterized in the UK. The UK currently recommends pneumococcal vaccination for certain 'At Risk' adult individuals. However, reports on vaccine coverage rates (VCR) for this population are very limited. The last uptake rate for pneumococcal vaccination in the UK was published in 2009 and only showed a vaccine coverage rate of 34.4%. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the clinical and economic burden of pneumococcal disease and examine the pneumococcal VCR in adults aged 18 to 64 years old with underlying medical conditions using 2011-2016 Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data. This retrospective cohort study will be conducted using anonymized electronic health record (EHR) data from 2011-2016.

Descriptive statistics including frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, mean (SD) for continuous variables, will be calculated. Rates and rate ratios of pneumococcal diseases will be reported among patients with each chronic condition compared with age-matched healthy counterparts; rate of pneumococcal vaccination will be reported among patients with each underlying condition by length of follow-up since diagnosis (ranging from 1 to 4 years).

Although generally well tolerated, statins can cause muscular side effects, primarily muscle pain, which may lead to treatment termination. The risk of developing such side-effects increases with higher prescribed doses of a statin. Whether the choice of statin type influences the risk of muscle-related problems remains controversial. It has been suggested that hydrophilic, or water-soluble, statins, which are one subgroup of statin drugs, cause less muscle problems than lipophilic, or fat-soluble, statins because they are less likely to enter muscle cells. However, studies comparing hydrophilic with lipophilic statins, irrespective of prescribed doses, reported no difference in the risk of muscle problems. Still, it is possible that, at comparable doses, hydrophilic statins cause less muscle problems than lipophilic statins. Surprisingly, a study, which analysed the risk of severe but rare muscle inflammation during statin treatment, found that the different doses of the hydrophilic statin called rosuvastatin were more toxic than comparable doses of other lipophilic statins. 
Analyses that evaluated the risk of any muscle problems, either severe or mild, reported that comparable doses of hydrophilic and lipophilic statins were similarly safe. Although these analyses evaluated statin-related muscle problems more broadly, they might have failed to detect differences in the risk of side-effects between statin types, as patients analysed were sometimes known to have tolerated statin treatment before. We aim to compare the risk of any muscle problems between hydrophilic and lipophilic statins of comparable doses in patients who newly receive statins.","We will apply a propensity score matched sequential cohort study design to compare the risk of muscular events between new users of hydrophilic statins (i.e. pravastatin, rosuvastatin) vs lipophilic statins (i.e. simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin) at comparable lipid-lowering doses. Five comparisons between individual statins are planned; pravastatin vs simvastatin or fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin vs atorvastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin, although we may need to drop the latter two because of small sample size. We will conduct analyses separately in patients taking statins for primary cardiovascular prevention (i.e. no previous ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction) and those taking statins for secondary prevention. 
We will identify patients aged 40 to 80 years with a first-time prescription for a hydrophilic or lipophilic statin between 2000 and 2017 (cohort entry date). In each comparative analysis, hydrophilic statin users will be (1:1) matched to lipophilic statin users on a propensity score. We will conduct matching within 2 year enrolment blocks to avoid time-trend bias (expanding statin indications over time). After concatenating all matched patients into one cohort, we will follow them from day 1 after cohort entry until the first Read code for myalgia, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis or until they are censored due to treatment cessation, treatment switch to another statin, death, leaving the CPRD, a Read code for an exclusion criterion or reaching the end of study period. We will follow patients for a maximum of 1 year since statin-associated myotoxic events occur predominately shortly after treatment start. We will perform Cox-proportional hazard analyses to calculate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the risk of muscular events in new users of hydrophilic vs lipophilic statins.

Even though they are very effective bleedings are more likely, for instance bleeding in the stomach or brain, which can lead to death. We have developed a set of patient safety indicators representing potentially ""hazardous prescribing events"" (HPEs).  The overall aim of this study is to get information for an evaluation of the value for money of programmes that try to reduce the number of HPEs. There is some evidence about how often HPEs occur, but we do not know how much harm they cause to patients. Therefore, we will use linked primary care, hospital and mortality records to investigate the relationship between HPEs and patient harm in England. HPEs are also likely to be associated with high costs due to events like hospital admissions for stomach bleeds. We plan to analyse the value for money of programmes targeting HPEs by combining information on harm and costs related to HPEs.","Antithrombotic treatments, such as oral anticoagulants (OACs) and antiplatelets, are highly effective in reducing cardiovascular risk. However, due to the mechanism of action, bleedings are likely. Bleeding events, such as gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds or intracranial haemorrhages (ICH), are rare but have a huge impact on patient's quality of life and treatment costs. Hazardous or erroneous prescribing of antithrombotics, which will be referred to as hazardous prescribing events (HPEs), is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and mortality. This study will analyse specific HPEs defined by a set of patient safety indicators (PSIs).  The PSIs are used in interventions that aim to reduce HPE. To analyse the cost-effectiveness of these interventions information on HPE prevalence, associated harm and costs are required. Evidence on harm for the patient and costs related to HPEs is sparse. Therefore, this study will undertake a retrospective cohort analysis to estimate the incidence of harm including bleeding events, mortality and NHS costs associated with HPEs using linked primary and secondary healthcare datasets. Probabilities of bleeding events, mortality and resource use will be used to generate input parameters for an economic model which will estimate the overall economic impact of hazardous prescribing in this context.",#NAME?,"Professor Rachel Elliott - Chief Investigator - University of Manchester

1616633985-2461,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=12,Ageing Inequalities: A cohort study to investigate delay in diagnosis and inequalities in treatment of dementia and cancer in the elderly,"Diseases of ageing are increasingly important for our healthcare system and impact society as a whole. Two of the most important diseases in older age are dementia and cancer. For these conditions, factors such as age, poverty, ethnic background, previous education, and having other health conditions may influence how quickly patients get diagnosed, and how effective their care and treatment is. This may lead to worse outcomes in disadvantaged groups. 
In this study, we aim to study dementia and cancer to: 
1.	Describe who is likely to get a delayed diagnosis, and identify the risk factors for delay in diagnosis, such as age, frailty, or having several other diseases (comorbidities).
2.	Describe who is likely to get treatment or access to services which is below standard or does not meet national guidelines, and identify risk factors for under-treatment such as age, frailty or comorbidities.
3.	Examine whether delayed or missed diagnosis, and inequalities in treatment affect outcomes such as quality and length of life.
4.	Investigate the interaction between dementia and cancer, particularly in terms of how they affect recognition, management and outcomes of each other. As an example, memory symptoms may delay diagnosis of cancer and may hamper treatment plans (e.g. for pain), which will go on to have a further damaging impact on memory symptoms.

We hope that by identifying patterns and causes of delays and under-treatment we can contribute to improvements in health services that will enhance quality of life for our ageing population.","We plan a cohort study using primary care data, with linked hospital records and cancer registry data. We will study two key diseases of ageing for which delays in diagnosis and treatment in the elderly are known to be a problem. Cancer and dementia are both of increasing public health concern, affect mainly the elderly population, and improving the timely diagnosis of each has been targeted in the NHS long term plan. 

In our cohort, we will identify cases of each condition, by triangulating evidence from 2-3 sources of data (primary care, HES, and cancer registry). We will identify evidence of delay in diagnosis for both conditions. We will identify evidence of under-treatment for cancer cases, and examine services used following diagnosis of dementia. We will then look at the consequences of delays, different types of service used and adequacy of care or treatment on outcomes including prognosis, quality of life and pathways of care. 

We will assess all possible risk factors, social inequalities, and other known confounders and comorbidities as potential contributors to under-diagnosis and under-treatment. We are interested in factors which may reflect inequalities in society, such minority ethnic status, or multi-morbidity. Comorbidities which may impact on recognition and treatment include diabetes, respiratory disease, heart disease and frailty, while social factors include age, sex, ethnic background, local economic deprivation, smoking and drinking. We will examine the relationship between cancer and all types of dementia, to generate hypotheses about the mechanisms which underlie their negative association. 

We will use conventional epidemiological methods such as logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression to identify key risk factors and patterns, and will employ data-driven learning methods such as LASSO penalised logistic regression and random forest algorithms to identify the best set of risk factors which explain the patterns in the data.","Cancer and its stage and setting at diagnosis; the adequacy of treatment for cancer; cancer prognosis e.g. mortality, survival time, quality of life indicators, comorbidities.

These adverse events have been shown to occur at known frequencies in populations taking the medication and are listed on the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and package leaflet (PL) documents associated with the medication. 

This study aims to investigate the usefulness of primary care electronic health records (EHR) databases in medication safety monitoring activities specifically related to the ability to detect and monitor adverse events. This study will assess whether specific adverse events known to be associated with the use of a widely prescribed medicinal product can be observed from patients medical records obtained from a primary care EHR database. 

Alendronic acid is widely prescribed in the treatment of osteoporosis (a bone-weakening disease) in post-menopausal women and has been selected as the study medication. This study will look at reasons for clinical consultations while patients are on the medication to identify and quantify known adverse events. It will also look at clinical consultations prior to starting the medication to describe these patients.","This cohort study will assess whether specific identified safety risks associated with the use of a medication, widely prescribed in primary care, can be identified in a primary care EHR database. 

Patients will be identified from the CPRD GOLD database and the study conducted using the Database - Prescription Event Monitoring (D-PEM) methodology. The method of Prescription Event Monitoring (PEM) is well described and has been used for many years (1, 2). The PEM methodology in the UK was developed by the Drug Safety Research Unit and is a paper based method used to identify patients from prescriptions and detect safety signals from clinical event records. 

The purpose of this study is to examine whether using EHR database such as CPRD is feasible for conducting event monitoring and whether such use adds value to study methods in pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacovigilance and assess any problems or difficulties that may arise.

Alendronic acid (once weekly 70mg dose) has been identified as the study drug. Patients will be identified who have been prescribed alendronic acid (between 2000 and 2003) and safety events on treatment identified within a 12 month observation period. 

Categorical data will be presented as tabulations; continuous data will be described using appropriate summary statistics. Reasons for consultations will be tabulated using grouping based on clinical code levels to allow for patterns to be identified and quantified as individual recording variation may preclude signal detection.

Incidence risks and density calculations will be performed for safety events of interest. Incidence densities will be compared between time periods to allow for comparisons between: i) pre- and post-treatment exposure periods; ii) treatment exposure periods.","- Reasons for consultations during primary care treatment

1616633980-2459,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=12,A multi-database retrospective study of the comparative efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of type 2 diabetes (EMPRISE-UK),"Type 2 diabetes is a serious long-term condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high. There are many medications to help with type 2 diabetes. They all work by lowering blood sugar. However, they all have different side effects, so it is difficult for doctors to know which to prescribe. 

We want to look at a relatively new class of drugs indicated for diabetes called 'sodium-glucose co-transporter 2' (SGLT2) inhibitors. Research suggests that they may be better at reducing heart and kidney problems than other treatments for type 2 diabetes. In particular, research has suggested that empagliflozin, which is a drug belonging to the SGL2-inhibitor drug class, may have a direct beneficial effect on the heart. People with type 2 diabetes tend to have a greater chance of having heart and kidney problems than other people.

To do our study, we will compare SGLT2 inhibitors with another class of drug that has been around for a longer called 'dipeptidyl peptidase-4' (DPP-4) inhibitors. We will compare effectiveness and safety outcomes between the groups and we will also carry out a sub-analysis focusing on comparing empagliflozin-drug with DPP-4 inhibitors.

We will make use of four large primary care databases in England and Wales to better understanding of the findings. Results from the primary care databases will be combined to provide a more precise result of the effectiveness and safety of SGLT2-inhibitor treatment. This will provide important information to help with primary care clinical decision making.","UK guidance recommends that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors be considered as an option alongside other glucose-lowering agents at the first intensification of treatment for type 2 diabetes, where the patient has failed to achieve glucose control or cannot tolerate metformin. Growing evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors have a favourable cardiometabolic safety profile but much of this evidence is based on randomised controlled trials which limits generalizability to the real-world clinical setting. 

This part of a 5-site collaboration of different databases in the UK (SAIL, Discover, THIN, CPRD, RCGP). For the proposed analysis, Data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Gold database with linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) will be used to investigate:

1. risk of hospitalisation for heart failure in people with type 2 diabetes prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors;
2. risk of all-cause mortality in people with type 2 diabetes prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors;
3. risk of a composite outcome of all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure in people with type 2 diabetes prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors;
4. risk of cardiovascular mortality;
5. risk of composite outcomes of hospitalisation for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality;
6. risk of 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite outcome including myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular mortality in people with type 2 diabetes prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors;
7. risk of percutaneous coronary intervention;
8. risk of end-stage renal disease in people with type 2 diabetes prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors.
9. risk of hospitalisation, all-cause mortality, composite outcomes for empagliflozin vs DPP-4 inhibitors.

Results from the 5-sites will be combined using meta-analysis. We will take account of any overlap between CPRD and THIN using established methods.","Effectiveness outcomes

Long QT syndrome is a rare, affecting 1 in 2000-3000 individuals, heart rhythm problem, where the heart muscle takes longer than normal to recharge between beats. This results in an increased risk of an irregular heartbeat that can lead to fainting, collapse, seizures and avoidable sudden death.

Bicuspid aortic valve disease is the most common congenital (present at birth) heart defect, affecting between 1 in 50 and 1 in 200 individuals. It occurs when the normal three leaflets of the aortic valve as it leaves the heart, (the aorta is the main artery in the body), are fused resulting in only two leaflets and hence the term bicuspid aortic valve. This causes an increased risk of problems with this valve and the first part of the aorta that can cause both ill health and premature death.

These two conditions are both under-recognised and frequently associated with a long delay before diagnosis.

We plan to explore these two heart conditions in a population-based study. We will use anonymised primary care data, to better understand the clinical features that patients with these condition have and how they present to their GPs. This will give doctors and other health care workers a better understanding of what symptoms to look out for and thereby improve the diagnosis of these conditions.","Background: Both bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and long QT syndrome (LQTS) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and are under recognised. Bicuspid aortic valve disease affects 0.5-2% of the population and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality across the population than all other congenital heart defects combined. Long QT syndrome affects 1 in 2000-3000, and is a significant cause of avoidable sudden cardiac death.

Objectives: To explore the feasibility that primary care electronic patient records (EPR) can identify patterns as well as gaps in clinical coding for patients with under recognized inherited disorders, as exemplars of this we will look at the inherited cardiac conditions: bicuspid aortic valves and long QT syndrome.

Study Design: For each of the conditions, BAV & LQTS.
 - Part 1: Exploratory analysis to identify signals using Machine-Learning (Random Forest (RF) model method). 
 - Part 2: Case control design to verify/test variables that have been identified in part 1. 

Setting: UK General Practice 

Participants: Individuals identified with LQTS and BAV diagnosed in their EPR compared with propensity scored matched controls.

Exposures:  As this is a matched case-control study, identification of the exposures is the result of the study. These are the clinical features identified in primary care that can indicate such a diagnosis. 

Comparator: Propensity scored matched control group. 

Outputs: Those diagnosed with BAV and LQTS by Read code in the EPR.

The identification of these 'exposures', clinical features, could then be used to inform guidance, alert clinicians and develop diagnostic prompts for these conditions.","The recognition of phenotypic features identified in primary care that can indicate such a diagnosis.

Currently, COPD is the second most prevalent lung disease, affecting approximately 1.2million people in the UK. 

Exacerbations of COPD are defined as an increase in the severity of symptoms such as dyspnoea (breathlessness), coughing, and wheezing, and are typically triggered by bacterial/viral infections or air pollution. While exacerbations impact on patients' quality of life, they can also result in other severe complications, hospital admissions and mortality. Each year in the UK, COPD costs the National Health Service (NHS) approximately £1.9billion, which constitutes 29% of the total cost of respiratory illnesses. 

With the continued advancement and interest in COPD, there is a wide range of drugs widely available for the treatment and management of COPD in the UK. In particular, the use of Multiple Inhaler Triple Therapy (MITT) has been observed within the current clinical practice. There is growing evidence suggesting potential overuse and mis-use of MITT; therefore, highlighting an urgent need to determine optimal timing of MITT therapies within the COPD patient treatment pathway. 

This study will conduct data analysis using anonymised NHS data in order to understand whether the timing of MITT initiation post-exacerbation could influence future HCRU and direct healthcare cost. Results from this study may indicate that early initiation of MITT treatment for COPD patients could help to reduce the burden of COPD on the healthcare system.","Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to estimate all-cause and COPD-related healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) and direct healthcare costs of patients with COPD initiating MITT early (</=30 days) versus delayed (31-180 days) following a moderate-to-severe exacerbation.

Methods: This study will be a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study of COPD patients who are initiated on MITT within 180 days of an exacerbation between July 2012 and June 2015, inclusive. The cohort of patients will be identified from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data; specifically, the admitted patient care, outpatients and Accident & Emergency (A&E) data sets. Elements of HCRU that will be considered in this study include General Practitioner consultations, medication prescribed in primary care, outpatient appointments and hospitalisation, and the associated direct healthcare costs.

Data analysis: The study will be testing the hypothesis that patients who initiate MITT early utilise less HCRU and result in a lower cost to the healthcare system compared with patients with delayed MITT initiation. In addition, potential confounding factors will be adjusted for using regression models, and time-to-event analysis will be conducted to assess the influence of the delay of MITT initiation on future exacerbations.",All medications prescribed in primary care; COPD medications prescribed in primary care; All-cause GP appointments; COPD-related GP appointments; All-cause outpatient appointments; COPD-related outpatient appointments; All-cause hospitalisations; COPD-related hospitalisations; All-caused A&E visits; COPD-related A&E visits; Associated all-cause total direct healthcare costs; Associated COPD-related direct healthcare costs,"Dr Afisi Ismaila - Chief Investigator - GSK

Ethnic minority populations without diabetes also experience an excess of most types of cardiovascular disease. Control of blood glucose, high blood pressure and high cholesterol helps to reduce cardiovascular disease complications from diabetes. Despite this, we know little about ethnic differences in the use of medications which do this. Limited existing research suggests that both choice and effective use of diabetes, blood pressure or cholesterol-lowering medication may differ by ethnicity. 
This study aims to compare use of these medications for people with and without diabetes of European, South Asian and African Caribbean origin. Using computerised medical records, the commencement, type, dose, monitoring and adjustment of medication will be studied, and reasons for differences sought. 
By identifying ethnic disparities in the use of medications to control diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, we may highlight reasons for the excess of diabetes complications and cardiovascular disease seen in UK South Asian or African Caribbean groups. These findings may influence prescribing policies, and thus ultimately reduce ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease and complications of type 2 diabetes.","UK South Asian and African Caribbean people with type 2 diabetes experience worse diabetic control and more cardiovascular complications than the European-origin population; ethnic minority populations without diabetes also experience an excess of most types of cardiovascular disease. Explanations are unclear. Blood pressure and lipid control, crucial to cardiovascular risk reduction for people with and without diabetes, also differ by ethnicity. However, ethnic differences in prescribing for diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia remain understudied.
Ethnic differences in prescribing anti-diabetic (in people with diabetes), antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication (in people with and without type 2 diabetes) will be sought, including: i) time to commencement ii) choice of medication, iii) dosage, iv) monitoring and iv) time to intensification (either medication up-titration, addition or class switching) after detection of sub-optimal control. 
Primary care electronic medical records will be used. Established algorithms and code lists will define ethnicity, diagnoses and medication use. Data will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier time-to-event methods and logistic, Poisson and Cox regression models (according to outcome), with South Asian or African Caribbean ethnicity as the exposure (baseline category=European).

This delay can lead to patients not achieving good control of diabetes over prolonged periods and this in turn increases the risk of adverse effects on the heart, brain, feet, kidneys and eyes. Thus, it is essential to effectively and timely manage patients with poor glucose control. However, the consequences of a delay in treatment and subsequent poor diabetes control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are treated with long-acting insulin in real-world setting have not been previously studied in research. In addition, the length of time in which patients continue on long-acting insulin therapy following treatment start is not well known. Thus, accordingly, this study aims to investigate the effects of a delay in long-acting insulin treatment on the heart, brain, feet, kidneys and eyes in people with type 2 diabetes. We will also assess how long patients continue using long-acting insulin and what drugs they move onto following discontinuation of long acting insulin and the change in glucose control.","A number of observational studies in type 2 diabetes patients (T2DM) have reported that insulin initiation is delayed until after multiple oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) failure and deterioration of glycaemic control well beyond recommended guidelines. Such delay in treatment intensification is even more evident after basal insulin (BI) initiation. In a retrospective cohort study of UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), only 30.9% of T2DM patients clinically eligible  for intensification received additional treatment, with a median time to intensification of 3.7 years (95% CI 3.4 to 4.0).

The delay in treatment intensification in patients with poor glycaemic control (clinical inertia) has long-lasting effects on micro- and macrovascular complications of T2DM and has been referred to as ""negative metabolic memory"" also known as dysglycaemic legacy. In line with this notion, a 1 year delay in treatment intensification in patients with suboptimal glycaemic control on OADs is associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes including myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke. However, the consequence of delayed treatment intensification and suboptimal glycaemic control in BI treated T2DM patients in a real world setting have not been previously investigated. It is unclear what proportions of patients who do not persist on their basal insulin therapies move onto the various classes of antidiabetic drugs and what the trajectory of HbA1c control is thereof.

Thus, we aimed to investigate the associations of delayed treatment intensification and long-lasting hyperglycaemia with micro- and macro-vascular outcomes after BI initiation in T2DM patients using UK CPRD. This will be determined using time-to-event survival analysis using cox-proportional regression model (adjusting for time-dependent and time-independent covariates). Additionally, we will assess the duration of persistence for basal insulin therapies in people with type 2 diabetes, taking into consideration the various predictors of persistence and the type of insulin. We will also asses what drugs they move onto following non-persistence to basal insulin, and the mean change in HbA1c after 6 months.","- Macrovascular endpoints: The occurrence of the first (new onset) major CV event (MI, stroke, CABG, PTCA , amputation, new or worsening HF, death from CV events)

Although asthma itself can have a major effect on a person's health and wellbeing, asthma treatments can also have important side effects that are harmful. Asthma treatments include inhaled (ICS) and oral (OCS) corticosteroids both of which can lead to thinning of the bones (also known as osteoporosis), and fracture. Despite the high proportion of people who have been diagnosed with asthma, little is known about how often these side effects occur. In particular, information on the risk of osteoporosis is scarce and there are no asthma specific bone protection guidelines either nationally or internationally. This has become more important with the recognition that drugs used to prevent osteoporosis and fractures can themselves lead to significant side effects.
Our purpose is to a) understand how frequently people with asthma experience an osteoporotic fracture due to corticosteroids b) to establish the current use of bisphosphonate (drugs which are used to prevent osteoporosis and fractures) and oral corticosteroids and c) examine whether or not the exposure to bisphosphonates is associated with other side effects in people with asthma.
Our study will provide guidance for patients, clinicians and policy makers. More precisely, our results will help the development of specific related bone protection guidelines, which will guide patients/clinician decision making on treatment.","The objective of this study is to understand the link between asthma, corticosteroids, osteoporosis and fractures, bisphosphonates and atypical fractures. Specifically, we are interested in the following using CPRD linked HES data:

Determine the point prevalence and incidence of osteoporosis, fragility fracture and femoral shaft and subtrochanteric (atypical) fractures within people with asthma adjusting for the appropriate confounding factors. 
 - Logistic regression investigating factors associated with prevalence
 - Cox regression model determining association between asthma and incidence of a diagnosis adjusting for confounders

To establish the risk of fragility fractures in patients with asthma due to inhaled or oral corticosteroids.
 - Nested case control study defining i) cases as asthma patients with a fragility fracture diagnosis and ii) control asthma patients without a fragility fracture diagnosis.
 - Estimating the association between corticosteroids use and fragility fracture by using conditional logistic regression

The rate of bisphosphonate and steroid co-prescription in asthma and non-asthma patients.
 - Establishment of the co-prescription rate in the above two populations by age, gender and calendar year over the whole period for each cohort determining any association.
 - Using a Poisson regression model to determine associations between risk factors and co-prescription rate.

To examine the risk of femoral shaft and subtrochanteric fractures (known as atypical fractures) due to bisphosphonate use in people with asthma.
 - Nested case control study defining i)cases as asthma patients with a femoral shaft or subtrochanteric fracture diagnosis and ii) control group as asthma patients.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is also a rare and severe form of childhood epilepsy characterized by the presence of multiple seizure types but known for its drop seizures (where patients literally drop to the ground during a seizure), and mental deficiency or learning difficulties.[4-6]
Our objective is to estimate the number of individuals suffering from DS or LGS in the UK. We will also analyse their electronic health records to better understand which treatments are used by patients and when. . This will also include aspects like the use of medications, referrals to specialists and hospitalisations so that we can get the full picture of healthcare used by these patients. We will identify the cost of these resource items to estimate the financial burden associated with the current treatment of patients with DS or LGS.
We will also focus on the mortality of these patients and better understand the causes of death of DS and LGS patients.
Since these two conditions are considered as rare diseases, our findings are expected to inform the total cost of DS and LGS to the healthcare system and will be used in economic models which are used to demonstrate the value of a new drug.","The study objectives are (1) to estimate the prevalence by age groups suffering from DS or LGS; (2) to study treatment pathways; (3) to evaluate the financial burden of medical care of these two conditions; (4) to estimate the mortality rates by age groups and causes of death of DS and LGS patients.
Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office National Statistics (ONS) Death Registration, we will study the patients with a coded general practitioner (GP) diagnosis of DS and those with a coded diagnosis of LGS. Since these two conditions are difficult to diagnose and can be miscoded by the GP, we will also focus on patients using some specific treatments (from CPRD only as no treatment information is available from HES data)
The main analyses will consist in evaluating the prevalence of the two conditions in adult and children populations. Resource use for both inpatient (number of stays and length of stay, etc.) and outpatient (prescription items, referral visits, etc.) will be estimated for these patients.
Finally, these estimates will be scaled up to the entire population and will be used to evaluate the financial burden of medical care of DS and LGS in the UK.","- Prevalence of Dravet syndrome

The OMOP created infrastructure to map different types of data sources (mainly medical claims data and Electronic Medical Records) into a Common Data Model (CDM) format. At Amgen, we have transformed the CPRD GOLD database into a customised version of the OMOP v 4 format. The transformation enables us to optimize use of the CPRD database alongside other large data sources. In using the OMOP version of CPRD instead of the data in the raw format, we are able to use similar program code to interrogate this database and others that have different structures in their native forms but have been transferred into a common structure. This allows us to develop standard programs and tools to produce information from those transformed databases.
As we will aim to publish research done using the CPRD in future studies using our OMOP version of the database, we aim to also publish a methodological paper that we can reference that shows that we have our validated our OMOP version of the CPRD data and that the same results would be produced using the data in the raw format or in the OMOP format.","In order to validate the OMOP version of the database against the raw CPRD, the number of unique data rows will be compared between the raw CPRD data and the equivalent OMOP CDM-transformed CPRD data for the following tables: Practice, Patient, Clinical, Referral, Test, Therapy. 
In addition, estimates of lifetime point prevalence, period prevalence and incidence rates will be produced. We will produce these rates in the raw and OMOP versions of the database for twenty diseases and thirteen therapies chosen for their relevance to Amgen's products and for two lifestyle factors (smoking status and BMI) and two lab results.

We will produce two rates using the raw CPRD: Those that include information before a patient's observation start date (the greater of the UTS, up-to-standard date and the CRD, current-registration-date) and those that do not include this information. The standard version 4 of the OMOP CDM doesn't include the information before a patient's observation start date. We expect to show that the information prior to a patient's observation start date is necessary for calculating accurate incidence and prevalence rates and to show we get an exact match when we use the OMOP version of the database when this information is included.

No statistical tests will be carried out.","Counts of rows in tables in OMOP and raw CPRD; estimates of lifetime point prevalence for diseases, prescriptions, lifestyle factors and tests; estimates of period prevalence for diseases, prescriptions, lifestyle factors and tests; estimates of incidence rates for diseases, prescriptions, lifestyle factors and tests","Mr Joe Maskell - Chief Investigator - Amgen Ltd

Weight loss among newly diagnosed diabetes patients may lead to normalisation of blood sugar levels without medications and may reduce risk of future cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature mortality. The longer that weight loss is maintained over time may further reduce risk of these events, and weight loss occurring earlier during diabetes disease progression may be more beneficial than weight loss occurring later on. However, there is a lack of research to assess the impact of weight loss on risk of chronic diseases, and research in this area is necessary to inform interventions aimed at reducing diabetes complications such as heart attack or stroke among people with diabetes. Our research objective is to determine patterns of changes in weight following diabetes diagnosis and assess whether these changes in weight impact whether a person develops heart disease or other diabetes complications.","Cardiovascular complications account for the majority of diabetes treatment costs globally. Weight loss following diabetes diagnosis improves cardiovascular risk factors and may lead to diabetes remission and reduction in incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, cancer, and premature mortality. Results of intensive behavioural intervention trials have shown long-term CVD benefits of large weight losses, however weight loss achieved in these trials may not be achievable in the absence of an intensive intervention, and trial cohorts may not be generalizable to broader patient populations. Furthermore, the timing of weight loss in the diabetes disease trajectory and the duration that weight loss is sustained may affect CVD risk, though this has not been assessed. Although weight management is likely among the most effective methods to reduce diabetes complications at the population level, there are currently no existing policies for interventions focused on weight management in primary care. There is a need for research to identify effective weight loss targets to inform such interventions. Therefore, we aim to characterize weight change trajectories following diabetes diagnosis and determine to what extent weight loss, and distinct weight change patterns, may impact long-term health outcomes among adults with diabetes. We will use latent class analysis to identify patterns of weight change, and will then use Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios of the associations of weight change patterns and 10-year incidence of CVD, other diabetes complications, cancer, and all-cause mortality.","Cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, cancer incidence","Jean Strelitz - Chief Investigator - University of Cambridge

One example is high blood pressure, where people can take 3-4 drugs to prevent stroke. However, dozens of people have to be treated for at least a year to prevent a stroke in one person. This is because these drugs only reduce the possibility of stroke, they do not remove it altogether. Some of these patients may be prone to side effects such as falls and kidney problems which may be more common than any benefits.

This proposal aims to use information from the medical records from hundreds of thousands of patients to establish the link between drugs used to prevent heart attack and stroke and side effects. We will focus on drugs that lower blood pressure (known as antihypertensives), lower cholesterol (known as statins) or prevent blood clots (known as antiplatelets). This information will be used to develop a calculator which predicts a person's risk of experiencing side effects. This calculator will form part of a support tool which will help patients and doctors make better informed decisions about starting or continuing drugs.","Background
The population is ageing and consequently, the number of people living with age-related chronic conditions is increasing. Polypharmacy (five or more prescribed medications) is common in older people and is associated with an increased risk of adverse drug reactions. Preventative medications, such as those used to manage blood pressure and cholesterol, are common in polypharmacy and often require large numbers of people to be treated to prevent a small number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. This leaves many individuals on drugs of little benefit, some of whom may be susceptible to side effects such as falls, kidney problems and muscle pain. 

Aims
This proposal aims to quantify the harms of cardiovascular prevention medication, and the characteristics of those people most likely to suffer them. This research is one part of a larger research programme to develop a clinical decision tool which estimates an individual's likelihood of benefiting or suffering harm from treatment. 
	
Methods
Aim 1: Derive prognostic models for an individual's risk of adverse events associated with cardiovascular prevention treatment (antihypertensives, statins and antiplatelets) using data from the CPRD GOLD. Adverse event outcomes will include falls (antihypertensives), myopathy (statins) and bleeding (antiplatelets). 
Aim 2: Externally validate each model using data from the CPRD Aurum.
Aim 3: Use causal inference methods (propensity score matching, instrumental variable analysis) to examine whether modification of treatment could have an important impact on the risk of adverse events.","Primary outcomes - Falls; Myopathy/muscle pain; Intracerebral haemorrhage

Secondary outcomes - Fracture; Syncope; Hypotension (symptomatic); Acute kidney injury; Electrolyte abnormalities; Gout; Diabetes mellitus; Intracerebral haemorrhage; Cataract; Liver dysfunction; Dementia; Memory problems (including dementia); Gastrointestinal haemorrhage; Dyspnoea; Any adverse event

Two of the most costly and life-threatening vascular diseases are aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections. An aortic aneurysm refers to the abnormal widening of the aorta which is the main artery that branches from the heart, and aortic dissection refers to a tear in the aorta. If these conditions are mismanaged they carry a significant risk of disability and death, but understanding of the best approach to treatment and long-term outcomes is limited. 

Currently the principal approach to treating aortic diseases uses a range of medicines (treatments) to improve blood pressure, lower cholesterol and slow disease progression in order to improve patients' quality of life and survival (outcomes). There is, however, a lack of robust evidence at a population level to determine the influence of these medications and treatment goals on long-term outcomes in patients with aortic disease. This study therefore aims be the first population-based evaluation of health data from both the community and hospitals in England to assess the relationship between treatment and long-term outcomes in aortic disease.","Symptomatic aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections represent the two most commonly occurring aortic emergencies in England. They can result in significant morbidity and mortality, however, in the absence of acute aortic morphology changes or complications, a clinically stable phase may be achieved with judicious blood pressure control and statin therapy. In addition, there is emerging evidence for the potential protective effect of metformin and other medications

Current guidelines advocate the use of beta-blockers as first line anti-hypertensive therapy despite a paucity of evidence to support this.  Moreover, there have been no large-scale population studies examining the relationship between blood pressure control and long-term outcomes. Statin therapy and metformin have also been positioned as having protective effects on the aorta, but once again there is a lack of longitudinal data for their impact.

This study aims to interrogate linked primary and secondary care data to examine the relationship between blood pressure control and medication choice, statin therapy and metformin with long-term health outcomes in patients with aortic disease. In order to answer these research questions previously employed cox-regression models will be used with g-computation formulas to adjust for confounding and study the effect of dynamic treatment options on patient outcomes.",#NAME?,"Dr Colin Bicknell - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

To prevent strokes, blood thinners (anticoagulants) are important. For years, warfarin was the only anticoagulant. Warfarin is influenced by many factors and therefore requires monitoring of the anticoagulant status, using frequent blood tests (INR-measurements). However, this changed when the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) became available. NOACs have fewer interactions, and there is no need for INR-measurements. In large trials, NOACs show a similar effect in preventing strokes, with a reduced risk of bleeding. However, patients included in trials are often carefully selected. In particular this may be a concern for (frail) elderly patients that need to take multiple drugs for various other chronic conditions. Such patients were often not enrolled in the large trials. Therefore, we want to see if the difference in major bleeding when comparing NOACs to warfarin is modified by the number of other drugs someone uses, using data from daily clinical practice.  Also, we want to see which variables could predict the occurrence of bleeding in NOAC patients, especially shortly prior to the bleeding. Finally, we want to compare the occurrence of bleeding and stroke in patients who inappropriately received a reduced NOAC dose according to guidelines, with patients with a correct dose.","With this retrospective cohort study, we want to investigate the influence of the number of concomitant drugs used, on the safety and efficacy of NOACs versus warfarin treatment. Patients diagnosed with AF and initiating a NOAC or warfarin between 2010 and 2018 will be included from the UK CPRD. The relative hazards for the different NOACs versus warfarin on the outcomes major bleeding, ischemic stroke and mortality will be quantified using a Cox Proportional Hazard Model. The influence of the number of concomitant drugs used on these outcomes is assessed by including this as an interaction term in the model. Furthermore, we will assess predictor variables for bleeding in patients treated with a NOAC, by validating, and if necessary, updating existing prediction models for bleeding risk. As the time period prior to the occurrence of bleeding is of our particular interest, we will investigate the association between changes in (modifiable) risk factors and bleeding, shortly before the bleeding occurs. Finally, we want to compare the occurrence of bleeding and stroke in patients with an off-label NOAC dose reduction, to patients with an on-label dosage, applying propensity scores to evaluate if the off-label dose reduction was indeed unjustified or not.",#NAME?,"Dr Hendrika van den Ham - Chief Investigator - Utrecht University

It is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis in the UK and can occur due to a combination of genetic, environmental and constitutional risk factors. Recently a link between antibiotic use and RA has been suggested. Antibiotics are widely prescribed to treat a wide range of bacterial infections including respiratory tract, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and urinary tract infections. In the UK, around 30% of all registered patients in primary care receive at least one antibiotic prescription per year. However, antibiotics as well as targeting bacteria responsible for underlying infection can also disturb normal composition of very useful bacteria in our gut.  There is now a growing body of evidence indicating that antibiotic usage, particularly during childhood, may be a major risk factor for infections and certain autoimmune conditions. However, it is not clear if antibiotic use is associated with the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.  Using routinely collected health information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we propose to assess whether those prescribed antibiotics are more likely to develop RA.","An association between antibiotic use and certain autoimmune conditions (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease) has been suggested, however it is not clear if antibiotics are associated with the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.  If such an association exists, then antibiotic use could be potentially considered as a modifiable risk factor for RA, especially in primary care where such drugs are overprescribed.  The proposed study will 1) assess risk of RA among those prescribed one or more courses of antibiotics; 2) assess the association between antibiotic type (bacteriostatic or bactericidal) and RA.
Method and data analysis
We will identify individuals with first ever recorded diagnosis of RA between 1990 and 2018 using Read codes. Each case will be individually matched to 5 controls on year of birth, gender and general practice and assigned an index date corresponding to the date of their matched case.

People with pre-diabetes are likely to develop diabetes. However, diabetes can be prevented for many people with pre-diabetes if they attend a diabetes prevention programme. These programmes are usually delivered to groups and support people to follow a healthy lifestyle. In 2016, the NHS launched the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme for people with pre-diabetes. The programme delivers multiple sessions over 9 months and is therefore expensive to provide. Of those with pre-diabetes, some people are at very high risk of developing diabetes and would benefit from attending a prevention programme. Whereas, others are at lower risk and their blood glucose levels may even return to normal, healthy levels. Our proposed work will develop a tool for calculating this risk so that programmes can be targeted at those who would most benefit. We will develop a risk tool using factors such as glucose level, body mass index, age, and ethnicity and test how well the tool works using electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.","It is estimated that five million people have non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (HbA1c 42-47 mmol/mol (6.0-6.4%) or fasting plasma glucose 5.5-6.9 mmol/l) in England.

We aim to develop and validate a prognostic model which calculates the risk of developing T2DM in those with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, using factors such as glucose level, body mass index, age, ethnicity, smoking status, medications, blood pressure, history of cardiovascular disease, family history of type 2 diabetes. To derive the prognostic model, we will use data from primary care medical records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to fit a time to event model with time to T2DM as the dependent variable (using either a Cox proportional hazards model or a flexible parametric model). We will assess risk of T2DM at a clinically-relevant time points (5- and 10-year risk) and validate the model using bootstrapping.

The majority of antidepressant medications work by increasing levels of the chemical serotonin in the brain. While the opioid tramadol is prescribed as a painkiller, it also increases levels of a transmitter called serotonin in the brain. This can result in ""Serotonin syndrome"", when there is too much serotonin in the brain and can lead to serious complications and even death. Drugs that increase brain serotonin levels, such as antidepressants and tramadol, should therefore not be prescribed together. However, data from the UK National Program on Substance Abuse Deaths indicates that these drugs are being prescribed together, leading to at least one death every ten days. 
Therefore, tramadol-antidepressant co-prescriptions must be examined urgently. Anonymised data from a primary care database will be analysed to find out how common tramadol-antidepressant co-prescriptions are in the UK, and whether patients being co-prescribed these drugs are at a higher risk of unplanned admissions to hospital and death. This research could influence how tramadol and antidepressants are prescribed, to prevent complications and deaths, and to increase awareness of the dangers of combining tramadol and antidepressants to healthcare professionals and the public.","Chronic pain and depression are common comorbidities, especially amongst older adults. Antidepressants and opioid analgesics, are therefore often co-prescribed in primary care. Tramadol relieves pain via mu-opioid receptor activation, and enhancement of serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission. Combining tramadol with other serotonergic enhancers, such as antidepressants, could therefore induce serotonin syndrome - a potentially fatal complication. However, it is not known how widespread co-prescribing is, nor what excess risk might be associated with co-prescribing. Data from the National Program on Substance Abuse Deaths reports 144 UK deaths in 2012-15 where tramadol-antidepressant co-consumption was directly implicated, equating to one death every ten days.
The proposed research aims to use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to firstly ascertain the prevalence of tramadol-antidepressant co-prescribing in the UK over the last 20 years. Secondly, it will use linked hospital admissions and mortality data to determine to what extent tramadol-antidepressant co-prescriptions are associated with adverse outcomes such as emergency hospital admissions and death. We will carry out statistical analyses that compare prescribing periods when patients are prescribed both drugs with periods when only one drug is prescribed. To add robustness to the findings, we will use different statistical methods (time-to-event, self- controlled case series) as well as carrying out a comparison to the co-prescribing of antidepressants with codeine. This research has the potential to inform tramadol-antidepressant prescribing practice to prevent adverse outcomes and raise awareness amongst healthcare professionals and the public about dangers of tramadol-antidepressant combined use.","- Mortality (Primary)

Since their introduction, multiple studies have shown that taking PPIs may increase a person's chances of having cardiovascular events such as a heart attack or stroke if they already have serious cardiovascular disease. However, there have been few published studies that evaluated whether relatively healthy people taking PPIs have a higher chance of heart attacks. In this study, we will explore whether PPI use increases the chances of having a heart attack in a healthy population.","Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were introduced to the market in 1989 primarily to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease. Since their introduction, multiple studies have shown that exposure to PPIs among high-risk cardiovascular patients with concomitant use of antiplatelet medication (e.g. clopidogrel) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, little is known about whether PPIs increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) among generally healthy populations. 
Our aim is to evaluate the association between PPI use and risk of developing MI among patients in the CPRD. 
We plan to conduct a nested case-control analysis in a population of PPI users.  First, we will identify all users of PPIs within the CPRD. From this population, we will identify all cases who had a first MI and match them to up to 4 controls based on age (+/- 2 years), calendar year (+/- 2 years), sex, general practice, and index date (same date as their matched case). We will use conditional logistic regression to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs of MI among PPI users, compared with unexposed patients (patients who had their first PPI exposure after the index date).","The outcome of interest is a diagnosis of MI in the patient clinical or referral record.
MI will be identified using Read codes. We will exclude patients whose medical records started less than 180 days prior to the index date, and patients who were younger than 25 and older than 65 years old at the index date, as well as patients with history of old MI, stroke, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune disorders, malignancy, venous thrombus embolism (VTE) before the index date.

The symptoms of the disease include breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling. More serious symptoms from heart failure or associated diseases can result in the affected individuals being admitted to hospital. Previous studies have shown that the more heart failure hospital visits a patient has, the more likely it is that they will die. There are different types of heart failure: they differ by the amount of blood that is pumped through the heart. Those that have less blood pumped through the heart are treated effectively at present, but those that have higher amounts of blood pumped are more difficult to treat. A recent drug produced by Novartis (""sacrubitril/valsartan"") can potentially reduce heart failure hospital visits and risk of death for both types of heart failure. This study will take a similar approach to previous studies looking into the relationship between heart failure hospital visits and death, but this time in a UK population and for the two different types of heart failure. This will help Novartis understand how the new drug may benefit heart failure patients in the UK.","Objectives:
Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of hospitalization among older adults. It is associated with a large burden of disease for the individual and with high morbidity and mortality post diagnosis. Previous studies have suggested that recurrent hospitalizations is a strong predictor of mortality. The main objective of this study is to quantify the association between recurrent HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular (CV) death in the overall HF population and in patients with different ejection fraction (EF) phenotypes. The two types of EF phenotypes are HF with ""reduced"" EF (HFrEF) and HF with ""preserved"" EF (HFrEF). Other objectives are similar to the main objective and include: quantifying the association between recurrent HF hospitalizations and (i) all cause death and (ii) CV death in a hospital setting for the overall HF population and EF phenotype; quantifying the association between recurrent HF hospitalizations with all-cause or CV death in patients with comorbidities of interest; and trying to find predictors of mortality. We wish to leverage the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to national hospital episode statistics (HES) and mortality statistics (ONS) in order to quantify these associations for the UK population. The results from this study will help illustrate the potential benefits for a promising new Novartis HF drug in the UK population.

Methods:
Descriptive statistics will characterise the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at their first hospitalization. Cox proportional hazards regression will quantify the relationship between recurrent hospitalizations and mortality. Time to event (hospitalization and death) will be displayed using Kaplan-Meier graphs with comparisons calculated by the log-rank test. Negative binomial regression will be used to establish potential predictors of mortality using baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.

Study design:
This is a cohort study of patients aged >18. Patients with a HF diagnosis in the primary care database will be used to find patients in HES with HF in-patient admissions. Patients will be used for the analysis that are admitted for HF in the in-patient setting from 2010 to 2014 (inclusive) and without admissions for HF in the four years previous. Follow-up will be until study end, death or transfer out of practice.","Primary

Symptoms typically include recurring diarrhoea, abdominal pain, needing to empty bowels frequently, extreme tiredness, loss of appetite and weight loss. It is estimated that around 146,000 people in the UK have a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.

The treatments for ulcerative colitis aim to relieve symptoms during flares (periods where symptoms are particularly bothersome) and to prevent symptoms from returning. This is achieved in many patients using medications such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, and if required, biologic therapies. If these medications aren't effective at controlling symptoms, surgery to remove the colon and/or rectum may be an option. However, patients who undergo surgery do not necessarily achieve relief from symptoms and experience general complications, which may still compromise their daily living.

To better understand the consequences of undergoing surgery and what types of patients require surgery, this study in patients with ulcerative colitis who undergo surgery will compare baseline characteristics, and the resources and cost required to treat/manage patients prior to and after surgery. Results of this study may indicate that surgery is not the best option for these patients and instead further advanced medications are required.","Objectives: The primary objective is to estimate the pre- and post-operative healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) and direct healthcare costs among patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) undergoing a colectomy.
 
Methods: This study will be a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study of ulcerative colitis patients undergoing a colectomy between Jan 2011 and Dec 2015, inclusive. The cohort of patients will be identified from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics (Admitted Patient Care and Outpatient data sets). Then index event will be defined using Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures (4th revision) codes. Elements of HCRU that will be considered in this study include General Practitioner consultations, medicines prescribed in primary care (aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants), outpatient appointments and inpatient stays (including additional surgeries, length of stay, high-cost drug use).

Data analysis: The study will be predominantly descriptive in nature, with elements of comparative analysis between patients undergoing an elective colectomy versus an emergent colectomy. In addition, generalised linear models will be constructed to assess potential predictors of high post-operative HCRU and/or costs, type of colectomy required and post-operative complications experienced.","All-cause GP appointments; All-cause hospitalisations; All-cause outpatient appoints; All-cause emergency admissions; Primary care prescriptions of steroids, immunosuppressants and aminosalicylates; Post-operative complications in secondary care; Associated direct healthcare costs","Danielle Bargo - Chief Investigator - FlatIron Health

It can affect any artery, and therefore has multiple clinical manifestations, including angina, heart attack, stroke and compromised blood flow to the limbs.  As all are influenced by common underlying disease processes, any disease manifestation is associated with higher than average risk of any future ASCVD 'event' (e.g. heart attack or stroke), including death due to ASCVD.  However, ASCVD risk varies markedly between individuals.  This is important as treatment benefit is related to the extent of risk.  Individual treatment preferences and appropriate allocation of clinical resources will therefore also be sensitive to risk level.

Although we are currently unable to estimate individual future ASCVD event risks for those with established ASCVD, a possible method has recently been proposed.  This method requires testing in settings other than that in which it was derived, before wider use is recommended.  We therefore aim here to test this model among those registered within UK primary care practices.  In addition to assessing the tool performance per se, the study will help determine whether it has clinical utility in UK primary care practice specifically.","Aim: An external validation of the SMART prognostic tool in predicting the 10-year risk of secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events.

The symptoms can be mild or severe. Some risk factors associated with the disease in young children are already known, such as prematurity (born before 37 gestational weeks) and comorbidities such as congenital heart disease or Down syndrome. However, there are still some uncertainties in relation to maternal and pre-birth risk factors such as maternal smoking, type of delivery, breastfeeding status, birthweight, APGAR score (5 mins), mechanical ventilation, and oxygen use.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the newest class of blood thinners and have a similar effect compared to the traditionally used drugs, such as warfarin. Co-administration of other prescription drugs that strengthen the effect of the DOACs may result in an increased bleeding risk in DOAC users. To avoid this complication, it is important to change the dose of the DOAC or stop its use. 
Our knowledge regarding the prescribing of DOACs under this condition is limited. Therefore, in this study, we aim to look how and what extend general practitioners adjust DOACs when the other drugs that strengthen the effect were prescribed.","Background:
Prescription patterns of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are largely unknow before and during the concurrent use of interacting drugs. Compliance with labelling information is essential for the effective and safety use of DOACs.

Objective
This population-based descriptive study will assess prescribing patterns, including dosing adjustment, and discontinuation among DOACs users with concurrent use of interacting drugs.

Methods

A descriptive study will be conducted by using a cohort of DOAC users from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data. The study period extends from 2008 to 2015. All patients 18+ years of age with first prescription of dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban are eligible. The number and proportion of dosing adjustment, or discontinuous use of DOACs during the initiation of concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs will be determined.

The term IBD includes Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease which are both defined by long-lasting inflammation of the digestive tract. The inflammation usually causes severe diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss. An estimated 2.5-3 million patients in Europe have this disease. IBD can cause severe symptoms in the gastrointestinal tract as well as in the skin, eyes and joints. In addition, patients with IBD are more likely to develop different types of cancer. The cause of IBD is unknown, however, it is suggested that factors affecting the normal bacterial in the bowel are risk factors for disease development. Antibiotics are commonly used drugs in the treatment of different infections in the body. While the antibiotic agent kills the disease-causing bacteria, some of the ""good"" bacteria in the bowel are killed too. In this study, we will investigate whether use of antibiotics in childhood may be a risk factor for developing IBD later in life.","Exposure to antibiotics is associated with a temporary disruption of the human gut microflora which could possibly be a risk factor for developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this matched case-control study, we will count the number of prescriptions for different antibiotics in childhood among patients in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with IBD and compare this number to matched IBD-free controls.
Cases will consist of all patients in the CPRD with a recorded diagnosis of IBD. To be selected as a case, the patients must fulfil the following criteria; 1) at least one prescription for IBD-therapy after the date of IBD-diagnosis, 2) at least 10 years of history in the CPRD prior to the IBD-diagnosis and 3) no prior diagnosis of cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer), Down Syndrome or diverticular diseases.

DPP-4 inhibitors are a drug class used for managing T2DM, offering more flexibility in patients with kidney function decline. Still however, most members of the class require dose adjustment depending on patients' kidney function. The only exception is linagliptin which is licenced for all levels of kidney function. Previous studies have demonstrated that T2DM patients treated with DPP-4 inhibitors can be prescribed lower or higher doses in relation to kidney function specifications defined by the manufacturers. At the time, kidney function specifications were defined in Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) for all non-linagliptin DPP-4 inhibitors. Recently, manufacturer dosing specifications in relation to kidney function have changed for two members of the class. In particular, in January 2018 and July 2018, kidney function specifications for dose adjustment for sitagliptin and saxagliptin changed from CrCl to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) which is the recommended kidney function measure in the UK clinical practice. The aim of the study is to examine dose selection in relation to the new kidney function specifications.

The rationale of the study is to explore whether or not and the extent to which adoption of the recommended measure of kidney function into product specifications has resulted in an improvement in dose selection in routine clinical practice.","DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin) are a drug class indicated for the glycaemic control in patients with Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPC) require all DPP-4 inhibitors, except linagliptin, to be dose adjusted according to renal function. Linagliptin is the only member that can be prescribed irrespective of patient renal function. Previous UK  study demonstrated that approximately one third of T2DM patients initiating alogliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin or vildagliptin with a Creatinine Clearance  (CrCl) <50 mL/min, which was the common threshold of dose adjustment for all non-linagliptin DPP-4 inhibitors at the time of analysis,  were on a higher dose than the SPC specified dose. In addition, another recent study demonstrated that at least 10% of T2DM patients with CrCl >50 mL/min initiating on a DPP-4 inhibitor were prescribed a lower than the SPC specified dose. In January and July 2018, SPCs of sitagliptin and saxagliptin were updated to include new requirements for dose adjustment, specifying an eGFR of 45 ml/min as new threshold for dose adjustment.  Even though CrCl was the mainstay of measuring renal function in the past, currently, the recommended metric of renal function is glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the UK clinical practice. 

Adopting a retrospective cross-sectional study design and incorporating the new thresholds of dose adjustment for sitagliptin and saxagliptin, this study will generate descriptive statistics to to characterise DPP-4 inhibitor dose selection in relation to manufacturer specifications in a patient cohort treated with DPP-4 inhibitors after the implementation of renal threshold changesThe rationale of the study   is to explore whether or not and the extent to which adoption of the recommended measure of kidney function into product specifications has resulted in an improvement in dose selection in routine clinical practice.","1.

The symptoms associated with RSV infection could be more or less severe depending on, for example, the age of the patient or whether the patient had other health disorders or diseases. This study will use data already collected and available in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in order to understand how RSV affects patients and how it impacts the National Health Service (NHS) by examining GP and hospital attendances, prescriptions for medication, deaths and the estimated costs to the NHS. It will also examine who is more at risk to develop severe disease associated with RSV, e.g., premature babies (born before 37 gestational weeks), children with heart and lung disease, or elderly populations. The results of this study will be published and presented at medical conferences, and could help determine which patients might benefit most from future strategies to prevent infection with this virus.","Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most important cause of lower respiratory tract illness in young children worldwide and considered one of the world's greatest unmet vaccine needs.  However, the current knowledge on the disease is insufficiently detailed to underpin evidence-based decision-making on new RSV prevention strategies and therapeutics. Estimating the national burden of disease due to RSV is not straightforward. A reliable diagnosis of RSV infection relies on the detection of RSV in respiratory secretions, but this laboratory testing is not mandatory. However, laboratory surveillance data exist in England and are used to evaluate temporal patterns of respiratory pathogens.
This study will estimate the RSV attributable burden of respiratory and cardiorespiratory disease in all age groups and certain risk groups (e.g. children and those chronic medical conditions) using population-level time-series modelling with laboratory surveillance data. 
This study will also estimate the health care burden of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) likely due to RSV in young children (<5 years) (i.e. without laboratory confirmation). The healthcare burden will be based on GP episodes, prescriptions, secondary care contacts and mortality.","RSV-attributable burden of GP consultations for respiratory/cardiorespiratory diseases; RSV-attributable burden of hospitalisations for respiratory/cardiorespiratory diseases; RSV-attributable burden of outpatient visits of respiratory/cardiorespiratory diseases; RSV-attributable mortality for respiratory/cardiorespiratory diseases; Antibiotic prescription attributable to RSV.

Each year, there are an average of 600 influenza-related deaths and an estimated £1.3 billion cost to the economy due to influenza-associated lost working days. In some years, influenza-related deaths have even been as high as 10,000. Correspondingly, the influenza vaccine is recommended by the National Health Service (NHS) and is made readily available across the UK. The influenza vaccine has historically been shown to be a safe and effective means of reducing influenza associated disease and complications. Despite this fact, influenza vaccine uptake rates have failed to reach optimal levels across all subgroups. Amongst adults aged 65 and over, the UK has consistently been a top-performer in Europe in terms of vaccine uptake, but amongst at-risk individuals under 65 (where at-risk is defined by certain pre-existing co-morbidities, aged 65 and over, pregnancy, living in a long-term care facility, or caring for an elder), these rates has remained well below the WHO's target of 75%. In this study, we aim to assess the association of various patient and practice level factors with seasonal influenza vaccine uptake. The factors of focus for our study encompass areas including patient and practice level demographic characteristics, at-risk health conditions, socioeconomic indicators, living arrangements, pneumococcal vaccine uptake, practice-level vaccine promotion, and practice-level influenza vaccination advice. Identifying significant factors of influenza vaccine uptake may help to better understand these disparate uptake rates that have consistently been observed in the UK.","The UK's seasonal influenza vaccine uptake rate amongst adults 65 and over represents some of the highest in Europe, yet uptake rates amongst at-risk adults below 65 are sub-optimal. These uptake rates have remained relatively stagnant for nearly two decades. To better understand this varied performance, we aim assess the association between various patient and practice with seasonal vaccine uptake. We have designed a 7-year multi-level retrospective cohort study amongst adults aged 18 and over in England. The use of the English data permits the linkage of patient level socioeconomic data to our cohort. After applying our detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, we have identified ~3.3 million eligible patients, constituting our dynamic reference study cohort from which analytical cohorts will be built. These criteria ensure that patients are followed for an adequate amount of time, to more accurately assess their characteristics and outcomes. Seven seasonal cross-sectional cohorts will be constructed, where patients are observed for one full season. The primary outcome is whether or not a patient receives a seasonal influenza vaccine in a given season. Secondly, a longitudinal cohort will be constructed, consisting of patients continuously followed for 7 years (2010-2017). The primary outcome is whether or not a patient receives an influenza vaccine during within each season. Odds Ratios (ORs) of vaccination will be estimated via General Estimating Equation (GEE) Logistic Regression models, adjusting for clustering at the practice level (cross-sectional analysis) as well as within-patient correlation (longitudinal analysis). All models will adjust for patient and practice level factors encompassing areas including demographic characteristics, at-risk health conditions, socioeconomic indicators, living arrangements, pneumococcal vaccine uptake, practice-level vaccine promotion, and practice-level advising of vaccination. A secondary analysis will assess differences in characteristics between practices in the top and bottom 10% of vaccine uptake rates, when stratified by at-risk categories.",Influenza uptake rates,"Dr Paul Grootendorst - Chief Investigator - University of Toronto

1616633917-2432,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=13,Characterising end of life health care expenditure,"The increase in healthcare spending observed in England over the past few decades has placed a greater burden on government funding, particularly at a time when financial constraints are tight. This has led to an increasing interest in understanding the drivers of healthcare costs and identifying more cost-effective ways to provide care to patients. An area that has attracted particular attention is end-of-life (EOL) care. The hospital expenditure an individual gives rise to over a lifespan is increasingly focused on the last few years prior to death. This suggests that a greater understanding of the drivers of healthcare costs at EOL is critical to enable policy makers to develop better strategies to reduce costs without compromising EOL care quality.  For example, policies to achieve cost savings in the treatment of long-term conditions associated with persistent use of care over a prolonged period may free resources that can be used to support high quality care the last few months of life. Such strategies are likely to represent an efficient use of resources and be ethically acceptable.

Our research will identify patterns of EOL spending in both general practice and hospital care settings across a diverse range of patients and health conditions. This will allow us to investigate healthcare costs over time in the years prior to death and how these vary with both patient characteristics and health conditions. In turn this will help inform policies towards a more effective use of healthcare funds without damaging the quality of care patients receive.","Proposals aiming to reduce health care costs often target the high cost of care during the last year of life. However, focusing on such a short period is myopic. The majority of the highest cost group patients are not in their last year of life. At the population level, the proportion of the annual spending that is due to caring for individuals in their last year of life is considerably smaller than the proportion of the three years spending that is due to caring for individuals in the last three years of life.

To gain a complete understanding of EOL health care expenditure attention needs to be paid to patterns or trajectories of spending during longer periods before death. This project will characterise EOL care into profiles of expenditure during the final three years of life and will determine the drivers and characteristics that underlay such profiles.  Our sample are individuals who died during the calendar years 2012-2014. We will use CPRD data to identify primary care activity and linked HES data to identify inpatient, outpatient and A&E activity over a period of three years prior to their death. For each decedent, we will calculate aggregate health care costs in 36 monthly intervals.  

We will estimate group-based trajectory models (GBTM) to identify distinct trajectories of health care spending in the data such as persistent high users, progressive users, and late rise users of EOL care. Once the expenditure trajectories have been defined, the probability of membership to a cluster will be modelled as a function of patient-specific covariates such as age, diagnostic groups; chronic conditions, and number of co-morbidities.

More detailed information about the profile of spending near EOL can shed light on potential strategies to mitigate costs while preserving high-quality care at EOL.","The outcomes will be patient's health care expenditures measured in each of the 36 months prior to death.

Protection against organ damage in MM patients can be achieved with early diagnosis, early initiation of treatment and early prevention of bone complications. Diagnosis is challenging as it has a range of non-specific symptoms including bone pain, fatigue and fractures, which can often mean the disease goes undiagnosed or is diagnosed at a later stage. General Practitioners (GP) play a significant role in referrals of newly diagnosed patients to specialists for diagnosis and treatment - MM is the cancer with the highest percentage of patients consulting their GP three or more times before referral.  This project serves to estimate the frequency of presenting symptoms within the GP setting in newly diagnosed MM patients, helping to understand the conditions that may predispose MM.","Diagnosing symptomatic Multiple Myeloma (MM) is challenging, as it presents with a myriad of symptoms, with non-specific and multiple site symptoms such as bone pain, fatigue, fracture, etc. Given that GPs play a significant role in referrals of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients (NDMM), the primary care setting represents an excellent milieu to investigate the aetiology of diagnosis. This is the scientific research focus in this retrospective population-based cohort study in the United Kingdom (UK).

The main aim is to estimate the frequency of presenting initial symptoms of MM patients at their first point of contact with the health care system (within the routine primary care setting) in the UK. The primary objectives are to estimate the proportion of MM patients with a record of bone pain, CRAB criteria investigations (elevated Calcium, Renal Failure, Anaemia, Bone Lesions), and positive CRAB criteria in a cohort of NDMM patients within the primary care setting, and to describe the patients in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics.

We propose a study to determine whether knee replacement improves the life span of people with osteoarthritis in the knee, taking into consideration their other illnesses.","Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a leading cause of disability1 and has been associated with morbidity and mortality2. Currently, knee replacements (KR) are the only known effective long-term intervention for end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Consequently, the prevalence of KRs is escalating worldwide3. Whether total KR can reverse the increased risk of mortality among people with KOA is currently unclear. While it is hypothesized that KR would have a favorable effect on mortality, likely through promoting increased mobility1 and thereby improved health, studying this question is methodologically challenging due to the difficulty in controlling for confounding by indication. Patients with KOA undergoing KR may be healthier than those who do not undergo a KR. 
We plan to conduct a cohort study in a population of patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) to assess mortality rates in patients with and without a knee replacement (KR).  From among all patients with KOA we will identify people with a first primary KR code on or after the date of cohort entry (date of first KOA). Each KR patient will be matched to a non-KR patient on year of birth and sex. Each patient will then be followed from their index date (date of KR or a randomly assigned index date for non-KR patients), to censor date (date of death or end of record whichever comes first). We will calculate incidence rates and hazard ratios for death in the two cohorts.

1616633871-2413,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=14,Translation of the electronic Frailty Index for use with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems tool in hip and knee replacement patients,"Hip and knee replacement are two of the most commonly performed operations in the National Health Service (NHS), with over 200,000 performed in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2017. The majority of these operations are performed in older individuals, with an average age of 69 years at the time of surgery. As such, it is not uncommon for individuals to have additional medical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease. It is recognised that some of these conditions can influence the outcome after joint replacement surgery (such as risk of infection or death). Frailty is a concept that considers a patient's medical, psychological and social care needs, with increasing frailty associated with poorer outcomes in previous studies.

One way to determine frailty is by reviewing a patient's medical record. This is the method used by the electronic Frailty Index, using medical records kept by General Practitioners (GPs), where it is now widely used at the request of NHS England. However, hospitals within the UK use a different system to record patient diagnoses, meaning the electronic Frailty Index cannot be used in its current form using hospital data.

To address this, we will map the codes used by the electronic Frailty Index in GP systems to those used in hospital systems, and then assess if the two forms of the electronic Frailty Index give similar results. In addition, we will also assess the concordance between a newly developed index (the Hospital Frailty Risk Score) based on hospital data and the electronic Frailty Index.","Hip and knee replacement are common operations in the NHS, with 200,000 in 2017. 90% of patients have an American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score of >/=2, indicating most patients have a degree of co-morbidity. Previous research has considered the influence of co-morbidity on outcome after joint replacement using standard measures such as the ASA score and Charlson Comorbidity Index, with increasing disease burdens associated with poorer outcomes. However, there is increasing recognition of the need to consider patient health in a more holistic manner. The concept of frailty has been developed to do this, which considers a patient's physiological, psychological and social care needs.

The electronic Frailty Index (eFI) was developed and validated by Clegg et al., and uses a cumulative deficit model applied to READ code based primary care records to calculate patient frailty. The eFI is now widely integrated in primary care data systems. However, as the eFI depends upon READ codes, it is not currently possible to calculate frailty with this tool using Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) secondary care data, where information is coded according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10). 

This study will map the eFI for use with ICD-10 codes, such that it can be used in future investigation of frailty in the setting of arthroplasty using hospital data. This will require cross-mapping of READ codes used in the eFI to corresponding ICD-10 codes. The eFI will then be applied to linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)/HES records to determine the coefficients of agreement for frailty determined by the two forms of eFI and the distribution of frailty in each dataset. Furthermore, we will compare the distribution of frailty between the ICD-10 mapped eFI, and the recently published ICD-10 based Hospital Frailty Risk Score.","- Coefficients of agreement between READ and ICD-10 calculated eFI

It is associated with a lot of health complications, including kidney damage, problems with the heart or blood vessels, and strokes. These combined diseases are called 'cardio-renal-metabolic conditions'. Diabetes can also increase someone's risk of dying.

Over the last 20 years, there have been significant improvements in the treatment of diabetes. This has meant that people with diabetes are now living longer than they did in the 1980s and 1990s. However, people who do not have diabetes are also living longer. We do not know whether the improvement is the same for people with and without diabetes and whether there are international differences.

To test this, we will do a study comparing people with and without diabetes. We will look at all deaths and deaths due to cardio-renal-metabolic conditions. We will ask our colleagues in Norway, Sweden, Spain and Canada to do the same with their own databases so that we can see how things have changed and whether there are any differences between countries.","Using data collected from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Gold database with linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS), we will investigate changes in all-cause and cardio-renal-metabolic mortality rate of patients with type 2 diabetes in the period 1998 - 2017 and compare these to patients without diabetes. The cohort will include incident subjects with diabetes identified within CPRD (exposed individuals) along with 5:1 matched participants without diabetes (non-exposed individuals). The outcomes are all-cause and cardio-renal-metabolic deaths, identified via linkage to ONS.

AF increases one's risk of experiencing a stroke by about five-fold; therefore, these patients are prescribed antithrombotic treatments for stroke prevention of atrial fibrillation (SPAF). The drugs administered for antithrombotic therapy have changed in recent years with the introduction of a new type of drug known as non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Prior to this, oral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were considered the main therapies of choice for SPAF treatment. This project aims to describe the clinical landscape of SPAF treatment and to assess any changes over time in SPAF treatment since the introduction of NOACs. The study will be conducted using the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) analytic tools. OHDSI is a network of researchers and observational health databases whose overarching goal is to bring out the value of health data through large scale analytics. Encompassed with the OHDSI network is a variety of tools, including ATLAS and the treatment pathway tool (TxPath) which will both be used in this current study. Using several healthcare databases, the TxPath tool will be used to produce sunburst graphs which show the pathways through which patients receive their different treatments over time. This study will impact the knowledge of the current landscape of the treatments received by AF patients and any switching patterns that may occur.","The AF treatment pathways study is a retrospective network study using Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data sources available either internally (CCAE and MDCR from US, and CPRD from UK) or from a research collaborator in the OHDSI network. The intention of this study is to characterize treatment for stroke prevention of AF (SPAF) while accounting for database heterogeneity, population diversity and variance in care. The study population is patients taking antithrombotic agents for SPAF. The initial event is first time exposure to antithrombotic medication. The patients must at least a year of observation prior to the initial event. SPAF treatment prevalence is calculated following the tabulation generated by the database query (SQL code). A count of each unique treatment sequence is tabled from which the sunburst graphs will be created. Each data source will produce its own sunburst graph for SPAF treatment to see how treatment pathways vary by population, geography and data source type. Additionally, we will provide information on the temporal trends in SPAF treatment by stratifying results by year. This will enable us to assess any changes over time in SPAF treatment since the introduction of NOACs.",Treatment pathways for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients.

It also aims to describe the physical health problems experienced by these patients, the drug and psychological treatment these individuals receive, and how rates of treatment have changed over this period. The study will also update previous research on death rates, physical ill health and causes of death in these groups, relative to the general population. 

The results will lead to a better understanding of changes in mental illness burden over the past 18 years.","For each of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, other non-organic psychotic illnesses, severe depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders and personality disorders we will describe the trends in incidence, prevalence, all-cause and cause specific mortality, comorbidity, hospitalisation, drug and psychological therapy receipt from 2000 to 2018. 

Incidence rate will be defined as the number of disease onsets/sum of person-time at risk, prevalence as the number of cases/population size.

Clinical recommendations describe inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as appropriate medication for patients that have severe symptoms and experience acute worsening of the disease. However some patients may see more improvement in their disease when using ICS compared to others. More recently proposals have been put forward for withdrawing ICS among certain COPD patients who may not experience these benefits. This study aims to describe the number of COPD patients who have their ICS stopped and how this has changed over time. This is important as we need to know which patients with COPD could have ICS stopped and whether there are certain characteristics that clinicians can use to decide which patients need ICS to prevent further worsening of their disease.","The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) is an international organization that releases recommendations for COPD prevention, diagnosis and management. The recommendations for use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) state that ICS should be reserved for COPD patients with severe/very severe disease (GOLD C/D with frequent or severe exacerbations). Furthermore biomarkers and other patient phenotypes have been explored to best identify patients that would benefit most from ICS therapy. As many mild COPD patients have been identified as inappropriately prescribed ICS, withdrawal of ICS has been proposed. There is limited evidence around how to withdraw patients and which patients will succeed outside of a clinical trial setting. This study is a non-interventional cohort study using existing data (CPRD), to gain detailed insights on the withdrawal of maintenance ICS. The main objective of this study is to describe the trends in ICS withdrawal and identify characteristics associated with ICS-free time. The number of patients withdrawing over time will be described and a cox regression model will be used to determine the factors associated with ICS-free time and Kaplan Meier curves will be drawn to estimate 12-month withdrawal success (defined as time without ICS). The results from this study will be used to support the scientific understanding of current practice, to understand which patients are having this therapy withdrawn and whether they may be predictive characteristics to aid understanding of where this may be successful.","Primary Outcomes

These symptoms come and go and can last from days to months at a time. IBS is very common, and in the United Kingdom between one in ten and one in five people are estimated to suffer from IBS, mainly women between the age of 20 and 30. People with IBS have different symptoms, some patients mainly experience diarrhoea (IBS-D), some constipation (IBS-C) and other patients alternate between the two (IBS-M). Traditional IBS treatments include lifestyle and diet improvements and medications, such as laxatives, which treat IBS-related symptoms. 

Linaclotide is the first medication to be approved in the European Union for moderate to severe IBS-C, and although it is effective in relieving constipation symptoms it may cause diarrhoea. This study aims to describe how often patients taking linaclotide develop severe complications of diarrhoea (SCD), and to investigate which patients are most likely to suffer from such complications. The study was requested by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, relapsing gastrointestinal condition characterised by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. Prevalence estimations vary with the diagnostic criteria used, and in the United Kingdom (UK) were estimated between 9.5% and 22%. IBS can be classified according to Rome III criteria on the basis of the stool's characteristics: IBS predominantly with diarrhoea (IBS-D); IBS predominantly with constipation (IBS-C); and IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M), with approximately one third of IBS patients having each type.

Linaclotide (Constella), a guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist with visceral analgesic and secretory activities, was approved as the first medicine authorised for the symptomatic treatment of moderate-to-severe IBS-C in adults in the European Union (EU, and as a condition for approval the EMA requested a post-authorisation safety study to assess the risk of diarrhoeal complications in patients taking linaclotide. 

This study plans to investigate the risk of developing severe complications of diarrhoea (SCD) during treatment with linaclotide among patients with IBS-C in the UK and to investigate what the risk factors for experiencing SCD are.","SCD is the main outcome of interest and will be defined as diarrhoea (as documented by diagnostic codes) and subsequently (between the diarrhoea diagnosis date and 45 days afterwards) any of the following outcomes:

On the long-term patients with DM might get complications such as; eye damage (retinopathy), kidney damage (nephropathy), and nerve damage (neuropathy). DM can also damage bones resulting in fractures. How this happens is unclear. Current studies mostly focus on the question whether patients with DM have more fractures compared to people without DM or only focus on one fracture location such as hip fracture. It has been reported that patients who have DM for multiple years, or who have complications due to DM have more fractures compared to patients who have DM for a shorter time period or who have no complications.  However, studies who focussed on these subjects are very different and therefore it is hard to compare the results. In addition, it is not clear which fracture types are more common in patients with DM, since most studies only look at the total amount of fractures or one specific fracture type. Therefore, the aim of our study is to observe whether specific fracture types are more common in patients with DM compared to people without DM. Furthermore, we will also determine whether fractures are more common in patients with DM who have complications compared to patients with DM without complications.","The pattern of incident fractures among patients with and without T1DM and T2DM. Within CPRD all patients with a first ever prescription for an insulin or a non-insulin anti-diabetic drug will be selected. Patients will be matched by year of birth, sex and practice to 1 control. Patients with a first ever prescription to an insulin need to have a diagnosis for T1DM before the index date (the date of the first prescription) to be included in our T1DM cohort. Patients with a first ever prescription to a non-insulin anti-diabetic drug need to have a diagnosis of T2DM before the index date to be included in our T2DM cohort. Patients in both cohorts will be followed for incident fractures. 

Incidence rates will be calculated by dividing the number of fractures over the number of total person years. Incidence rate ratios will be calculated by dividing the incidence rates for patients with diabetes over the incidence rates of the controls. Fracture and sex specific incidence rates will be calculated. For patients with diabetes incidence rates will be stratified by the presence of diabetes complications at baseline.","-	The incidence of various fracture types in diabetes compared to healthy controls in men and women, wherein diabetes will be divided in type I and type II

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the skin and the joints. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis, that primarily affects the joint  It can cause pain and stiffness in peripheral joints, such as the joints of the hand.

Secukinumab (Cosentyx) is a recently approved drug used to treat psoriasis, PsA and AS. As part of the process of monitoring the safety of newly approved drugs, the manufacturer is required to provide regular reports to the health authorities who are responsible for drug regulation. These reports are called Periodic Safety Update Reports or PSURs.

Previous research suggests that patients with psoriasis, PsA and AS may have an increased risk of stroke or heart attack compared to the general population. In order to tell if secukinumab affects the rate of stroke or heart attack in these patients we need to determine what the rate of these events would be in the broad patient population. 

This study will look at patients who have been diagnosed with these three conditions, determine the number who experience heart attacks, and strokes or who die as a result of heart attacks or strokes. These numbers will then be used in the PSUR reporting for secukinumab to determine if the drug is having any impact on the frequency of heart attacks, strokes and heart and stroke related deaths.","Objectives:
Population epidemiological studies suggest that patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) may have increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease compared with the general population of the same age and gender (Bengtsson et al., 2017, Keller et al., 2014, Szabo et al., 2011). Secukinumab (Cosentyx) is a recently approved drug developed to treat psoriasis, PsA and AS. To confirm whether Secukinumab affects the rate of stroke or heart attack in patients with these conditions we need to determine the background rates of these events in the disease population..

Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) are reports  submitted annually to Health Authorities to update the efficacy/effectiveness and safety profile of newly approved drugs.. The data from the Secukinumab clinical trials regarding important identified and potential risks are presented in these PSURs. Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACE) is one of the important potential risks, and as such it is important to contextualize the data obtained from the clinical trials, with background rates from the population with the disease. 

We will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to national hospital episode statistics (HES) and mortality statistics (ONS) to estimate the rates of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (- or MACE) among the psoriasis, PsA and AS patient population. 


Methods:
Incidence of MACE will be calculated as the number of new cases per 100 persons at risk (incidence proportion) and as the number of new cases per 1,000 person-years at risk (incidence rate). Confidence intervals for both incidence proportions and incidence rates will be computed. Incidence estimates with confidence intervals will be computed separately for each combination of age and sex. 

Data analysis:
Patients recorded with diagnoses of psoriasis, PsA or AS between 1 January 1998 and 30 June 2017 (inclusive) will be used.","The outcome of interest in this analysis is any MACE, defined as a composite end-point of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death.","Paola Primatesta - Chief Investigator - Novartis Pharma AG

Using data collected in the CPRD Gold database with linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) (admitted care, accident and emergency and outpatient) and ONS death registry, the study will identify a cohort of adult patients who underwent major lower limb amputation for limb ischaemia during 2000-2016. Once identified, primary and secondary care episodes preceding the amputation will be scrutinised to assess if patients underwent cardiovascular assessment. Patients will be stratified into 5 groups - those that underwent their most recent assessment within 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months prior to their amputation and those that did not undergo an assessment within the preceding 12 months.

Exacerbations often require admission to hospital. Furthermore, our previous work showed that more than one third (37%) of patients who were discharged from admission to hospital for COPD exacerbation was readmitted for the same reason within 1 year and 12% within 4 weeks, despite extensive drug treatment to prevent exacerbations. Knowing which patients are at most risk is highly useful if COPD management is to be improved. Particularly patients with COPD who have high counts of white blood cells called eosinophils were found to be at high risk of exacerbations probably due to the unresolved inflammation orchestrated by these cells. These patients could potentially be targeted with biologic therapy.
This study will characterise a large sample of UK patients with COPD with specific focus on patients who are at risk of frequent exacerbations in spite of inhaler therapy.","Objective 1: To identify and characterise COPD patients that can be the target for biologic therapies, by allocating and characterising the following four study cohorts:
1.	General population of patients with 'active' COPD, who had >/=1 prescription for maintenance inhaled therapy 
2.	Patients with 'active' GOLD grade C/D (high risk) on dual or triple therapy 
3.	Patients with 'active' GOLD grade C/D (high risk) on triple therapy
4.	'End-stage of COPD' cohort: patients with 'active' COPD who died before the last extraction from general practice and who had >/=1 prescription for maintenance therapy within the period of 12 months prior to death

Objective 2: To describe the characteristics of subgroups of patients with 'active' GOLD grade C/D on dual or triple therapy (cohorts 2 and 3), defined by the following characteristics and combinations of (some of) these characteristics:
1.	Rate of COPD exacerbations
2.	Occurrence of COPD-related hospitalisation
3.	Average oral corticosteroids (OCS) exposure
4.	Blood eosinophil count (BEC)
5.	Smoking status
6.	Presence of airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC <0.70)
7.	Number of years with >/=1 or >/=2 exacerbations in the previous 10 years (subpopulation with complete data)

Objective 3: To assess outcomes and health care resource utilisation (HCRU) during one-year of follow-up in cohorts 1-3

Objective 4: To assess the all-cause and COPD-related mortality during one-year of follow-up in cohorts 1-3 using linked data to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The index date will be a randomly selected date of a prescription for maintenance therapy for COPD within a time window of 24 to 12 months before the most recent date when data were extracted from the GP practice (to select all patients with active COPD with at least one-year of follow-up after ID)
The study will describe demographics, comorbidities and clinical characteristics of the four cohorts and the subpopulations in the baseline year prior to ID and describe outcomes and mortality in a year after ID.","Outcomes of HCRU will be measured in one year after ID (outcome year) for those from cohorts 1-3  who have complete data and will also be described in the year prior to ID (baseline year) (objective 3) as mean numbers of:
1.	COPD exacerbations (acute oral corticosteroids and/or respiratory-related antibiotics course and/or respiratory-related A&E attendance or inpatient hospitalisation)
2.	Inpatient hospitalisation admissions (numbers,  duration and readmissions within 30, 60 and 90 days) for: 
a.	COPD exacerbation (ICD10 J44.0, J44.1 or J44.9)

The 2015 (US) Institute of Medicine report 'Improving diagnosis in health care' has highlighted diagnostic delays across different diseases (including cancer) as a major problem for contemporary healthcare systems. Motivated by these realisations we will generate evidence to help improve the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis in patients who present with symptoms in primary care. We will interrogate the rich Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data about events that occur before diagnosis (consultations, prescriptions, and investigations) in patients with symptoms, and which of these patients are then diagnosed with cancer or other serious illnesses. Our findings will update and strengthen current evidence about how presenting symptoms can be interpreted. They will provide the basis for updating clinical practice guidelines to support doctors, when they have to decide whether to refer or investigate a patient for suspected cancer or other serious illness, or to actively monitor them.","The overall research objective is to produce population-based evidence about the likelihood of cancer and serious non-neoplastic diseases* among primary care consultees, taking into account their symptoms and, where applicable, their history of repeat consultations, prescriptions, and investigations. We will estimate the predictive values of:
 - Different symptomatic presentations for cancer (overall and by major tumour site) and serious non-neoplastic diseases diagnosed within a year after presentation. 
 - Symptoms combined with information on pre-diagnostic events (such as use of investigations or prescriptions).

This evidence is needed to support clinical decisions about either specialist referral/investigation, or active monitoring (also known as 'safety netting') for patients 'at low but not no-risk'.

We will perform a cohort study, including patients aged 30 years or older with one or more pre-specified symptoms of interest recorded in CPRD between 2007 and 2016. Using primary and secondary care data linked to cancer registration data we will estimate the predictive values (and 95% confidence intervals) of each selected symptom, both for cancer and non-neoplastic disease. Positive predictive values will correspond to the proportion of patients with a given symptom that are diagnosed with a specific outcome (one of the cancers or non-neoplastic diseases of interest) within 1 year since first symptomatic presentation. Similarly, predictive values of different symptom-prescription-investigation combinations will be estimated. We will also examine the role of covariates (socio-demographic factors, comorbidities) possibly influencing predictive values.

Multimorbidity rises with age so, with an ageing population, we are likely to see increasing numbers of people with multimorbidity placing pressure on NHS resources.

We aim to determine how use of health services by middle-aged and older people (aged 50 and over), and the associated costs of care, rise with each additional chronic health condition. This can help the NHS target resources toward older patients who are most likely to have high use of services due to multimorbidity. 

Our research questions include the following. How much do the number of health conditions affect health care costs among older people? Does the increase in costs for each additional condition differ by age, gender, deprivation and whether the conditions include dementia or depression?

We will address these questions through analyses of a large data set, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We will use our analyses to estimate expected lifetime costs of health care from age 50 upward.

We do not have good information on how many people experience sudden sensorineural hearing loss each year and how many people are living with permanent hearing loss as a result of this condition. Current clinical guidelines say that patients whose hearing changes suddenly and who report this to their GP should be sent to hospital urgently. We do not know if people go to their GP with this condition and, if they do, if their GP sends them to hospital and what treatment they then receive.

As compared with the general population, individuals with MS have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (a general term referring to conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels), because they are more likely to have elevated blood pressure and blood lipids, and to be obese, which are all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Evaluating the cardiovascular risk of individuals with MS is therefore important, considering that increased cardiovascular risk in individuals with MS is also associated with more rapid disease progression and increased risk of death.

This projects aims to improve our understanding of the association between cardiovascular risk factors, occurrence of major cardiovascular events (stroke and heart attack), and risk of disability in MS. Specifically, the projects has the objective to evaluate whether the risk of major cardiovascular events in individuals with MS differs from the general population. The project also has an additional objective that consists in developing and validating a clinical tool to predict the risk of MS-related disability and major cardiovascular events for individuals with MS, suitable to be used by general practitioners and nurses when examining individuals with MS.","Cardiovascular risk assessment and management is important in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) considering they have high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, have increased risk of macrovascular complications, and cardiovascular risk factors are associated with more rapid disease progression and higher mortality.

Multivariable survival hazard models will be employed to assess whether incident rates of macrovascular events differ between individuals with MS and the control population.

It is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. After chickenpox, the virus remains in the body.  When our immune system is weakened through illness or age, the virus can reactivate to cause shingles. 

It generally resolves by itself; after about one month the symptoms will usually have disappeared.  However, some patients go on to develop complications.  If you were to take 100 patients over 60 years of age with zoster, around 10 would develop long-term pain, called postherpetic neuralgia, and around 4 would develop complications involving the eye such as eye infections. It is estimated that another 4 in the 100 patients will develop one of a range of other complications, some of which are severe. We have a very poor understanding of the proportion and characteristics of zoster patients developing these rarer complications.  However, they can have serious impacts on patients, and be costly to the healthcare system. We can now vaccinate against zoster: therefore, a better understanding of the epidemiology of these rare but severe zoster complications (and how well vaccination protects against them) is important right now to inform vaccine policy. 

The objective of this research is to carry out a longitudinal study using UK healthcare data to estimate the number of people experiencing acute complications following a first ever episode of zoster and to estimate how effective the current shingles vaccine is at protecting against these complications.","Herpes zoster can have serious complications, beside postherpetic neuralgia, many of which are severe, life-threatening and costly to the healthcare system. However, data on their incidence and their risk factors is limited. The objective of this research is therefore to estimate the incidence of acute complications following zoster and to estimate the effectiveness of the Zostavax vaccine against these complications. 

We will first carry out a cohort study among individuals with zoster, matched on age, sex and practice, to ten patients without zoster. We will fit Cox models, with current age as the underlying time-scale, to obtain hazard ratios for our outcomes in patients with and without zoster, adjusting for covariates, within the first year of zoster. We will go on to stratify our results on age group, severe immunosuppression and common comorbidities.  We will also assess the incidence of and risk of the outcomes according to whether patients were given antiviral treatment within seven days of diagnosis. 

We will then use a self-controlled cases series (SCCS) to quantify the relative risks of four zoster attributable acute complications (encephalitis, pneumonia, cellulitis or keratitis).  Use of a SCCS design ensures we remove between-person confounding. Conditional Poisson regression will be used to estimate the incidence rate of each outcome during risk periods following zoster and compared with the incidence in baseline periods, adjusted for age. 

We will estimate the effectiveness of Zostavax against complications of zoster among the subset of zoster patients who were eligible for zoster vaccination after its introduction on 01/09/2013. Cox regression will be used to assess the overall association between vaccination and outcome and model rates of outcomes by exposure status, adjusting for covariates.","Primary

Research shows that complicated instructions for taking medication effect how successfully that drug treats a condition. Medication complexity varies between patients, and is assessed by looking at how a drug is taken (e.g. a tablet or injection), how often it is taken, and whether extra directions are included, such as 'with food' or 'in the morning'. Patients with more complex drug routines may struggle to take their medication correctly. This is a problem because patients may take too-much or too-little of a drug, causing the medication not to work correctly. 

Our research will start with a random group of 300,000 patients from English general practices. We will use statistics to explore the range of medication complexity in this group. We will look at factors such as the patient's age, sex, socio-economic status and long-term health problems. We will then study the use of medication reviews and how they affect medication complexity.

The results will help to identify patients that have more complicated medication routines, and how to improve the quality of care for patients taking prescriptions.","Prescribing is a key therapeutic intervention offered by doctors, the majority occurring in primary care.  With an ageing, multimorbid population, the number of patients taking multiple medication in the UK is increasing.  Yet, patients' medication regimes differ depending on the drugs prescribed, and little is known about the epidemiology of medication complexity in the general population.   

A random sample of 300,000 patients aged 1 year or more will be selected and medication regimen complexity index (MRCI) score calculated for a random date in 2017.  MRCI score will be compared across age, sex, socio-economic status and multimorbidity groups.  In a second sample, 50,000 patients who had a medication review in 2017 will be matched to 50,000 patients who did not.  A difference-in-difference analysis will be conducted using multivariable regression to compare changes in MRCI score before and after the medication review in exposed and unexposed patients.  Adjustments will be made for age, gender, socioeconomic status, long-term morbidities, and GP surgery.  

This work will provide greater insight into the medication burden of the general UK population, and evaluate how successfully current medication reviews are in simplifying medication regimes.

Yet, there are uncertainties in the choice of medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin, if tolerated, is the preferred first-line medication. However, it fails to control the symptoms in most patients and there is currently no consensus on what medications to recommend next. It is recognized that the decisions on which treatment to recommend after another medication has failed should be tailored to the patient's characteristics and should prevent or delay the development of diabetes complications. Health policy makers lack evidence to formalize recommendations on sequences of treatments to treat type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study is methodological: it aims to demonstrate the use of a simple, accessible and theoretically robust method to identify a sequence of treatment decision rules for type 2 diabetes. Findings will be important in the field of biostatistics and will generate evidence on the individualized treatment of type 2 diabetes.","The objectives of this study are primarily methodological. We aim to develop a novel method to identify a sequence of individualized treatment decisions when the outcome of interest is survival time. Theoretical derivations will be used to formalize the novel method, hereafter referred to as dWSurv, and its performance will be assessed via computer simulations. The analysis of type 2 diabetes treatment pathways will be conducted to showcase the newly developed method while answering an important clinical question: what is the optimal sequence of individualized treatment decisions for maximizing the overall complication-free survival time when metformin initially fails to control the symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes? The study population consists of all patients who were treated with a first-ever prescription of metformin. The study cohort will be selected from the CPRD data linked with the HES database.

Beta-blocker eye drops are effective at reducing the pressure but should not be used in patients with a specific set of diseases that affect the lungs, heart or blood vessels as they can cause unwanted side effects. This aim of this study is to discover if UK patients with these specific diseases are being prescribed these treatments even though they are not suitable. Previous studies have found that this was true but in recent years there have been other medications available that may have changed this outcome. The findings of this study will be important to help report the current risk to patients and to potentially emphasize the need for prescribing more suitable medications for glaucoma patients.","Objectives:
This study is to elucidate the recent prescribing trends of topical beta-blocker therapy for newly diagnosed Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) and Ocular Hypertension (OHT) patients in the UK. In particular, it will describe whether POAG and OHT patients with contraindicated comorbidities for topical beta-blockers are still receiving topical beta-blocker therapy in spite of explicit guidelines against their use and recent improvements in availability of alternative medications. It will also examine (i) the number of patients diagnosed with contraindicated comorbidities before diagnosis, after diagnosis, after diagnosis but before topical beta-blocker therapy and after topical beta-blocker treatment, (ii) the treatment line for topical beta-blocker treatments, (iii) if the patients are in receipt of concurrent contraindicated treatments and (iv) the number of topical beta-blocker prescriptions in the 6 months after the first topical beta-blocker prescription. An analysis of this data is required to potentially highlight the need for more appropriate treatments to be prescribed for POAG and OHT and to inform a potential prescribing policy change in the UK.
Methods:
This is a descriptive study and therefore no complex statistical methods will be applied. Only descriptive statistics such as frequency counts, percentages, mean, standard deviation, range, median and interquartile range will be reported. 
Data analysis:
Patients diagnosed with POAG or OHT between 2013 and 2016 in the CPRD database will be included. This is to assess more recent prescribing trends and to allow at least one year of follow-up data for prescribing patterns.","- Primary: Patient counts/frequencies for Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) and Ocular Hypertension (OHT) patients with selected cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities contraindicated for topical beta-blocker use 
 - Secondary: Patient counts/frequencies for POAG/OHT with selected cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities in specific time intervals: (i) before POAG/OHT diagnosis, (ii) after diagnosis, (iii) after diagnosis but before topical beta-blocker treatment, (iv) and after topical beta-blocker treatment 
 - Secondary: the number of topical beta-blocker prescriptions in POAG and OHT patients 6 months after first topical beta-blocker prescription

Cortisol is one of a group of substances called glucocorticoids and without glucocorticoid replacement, adrenal insufficiency leads to premature death. However, with conventional treatment, adrenal insufficiency continues to be associated with reduced life expectancy often due to circulatory problems (cardiovascular disease).
Unintended glucocorticoid overdose may be a factor. In the past, glucocorticoids have traditionally been prescribed in high doses because normal amounts of glucocorticoid production were not known. In modern treatment regimens, lower glucocorticoid dosages are employed. Also, statins and blood pressure lowering drugs are increasingly being used. All could help reduce cardiovascular disease. Therefore, death and disability from cardiovascular disease may now be lower than observed with previous treatment regimens.
This observational study will examine the overall death and disability rates from cardiovascular disease in people with adrenal insufficiency. We hypothesise that the life expectancy and general health of these patients are now similar to that of the general population.","A retrospective cohort study is planned. The study population comprises patients diagnosed with Addison's disease, hypopituitarism, and/or adrenal insufficiency - as per the Clinical Practice Research Datalink record - between 1st January 1987 and 31st December 2017. Outcomes of interest are risks of cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity (myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial diseases), and adrenal crisis, all of which will be derived from primary care code lists, Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality information. The primary aim is to compare the cardiovascular event rate in adrenal insufficiency patients with that in a background population.
A further aim is to compare the all-cause mortality rate in adrenal insufficiency patients with that in the general population and to describe other causes of deaths in adrenal insufficiency patients. The observed rate of cardiovascular events in adrenal insufficiency patients will be compared with the expected rate, as observed in the CPRD general population, with age and sex standardization, and derivation of the standardised incidence ratio (SIR). Factors associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity will be evaluated using a multivariate Cox regression model. The hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval will be adjusted by age of onset, sex, and period of follow-up.",#NAME?,"Professor Desmond Johnston - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

Psoriasis affects the quality of life of people with the condition and needs good treatments that work well. Importantly, it is known that people with psoriasis also have other medical conditions affecting the heart, the kidneys, and the liver, and these conditions means that some people need to access many treatments and frequently use the National Health Service (NHS). This study will describe the types of healthcare treatments and services and associated costs to the NHS for people who have psoriasis. Understanding the use of healthcare for people with psoriasis is important because it allows people developing new services and treatments to see where they should be directed and improved. Our aim is to describe the patient journeys for people with psoriasis alone and with other conditions so we can see where better care and treatments may be needed. We also aim to examine patterns of health events, treatments and referrals to other healthcare services that occur prior to the diagnosis of psoriasis that may help to identify opportunities for earlier diagnosis. We will compare these health events with those occurring over the same time in individuals without psoriasis. This will enable us to decide on events most likely to indicate onset of psoriasis and important earlier signs leading up to its onset.","The first aim of the study will be to identify, and quantify, the use of healthcare resources (including: medicines; GP-visits, out-patient visits, A&E visits, hospitalisation) and associated costs to the NHS for the experienced patient journey of people with psoriasis and selected co-morbidities. The study will use a retrospective analysis of cohort data that links CPRD (clinical practice research datalink) with HES (hospital episode statistics) and ONS (Office National Statistics) mortality data and patient-level IMD (index of multiple deprivation). A cohort study comprising adult patients identified using a Read coded diagnosis of psoriasis between 01/04/2007 and 31/12/2018, and eligible for linkage to A&E, outpatient and inpatient HES and ONS records will be matched (on age, gender and practice) with unaffected comparison patients. Generalised linear models will be used to compare differences in resource use between groups. Selection will be restricted to patients registered with a contributing practice for at least one year and follow-up will end when the patient either dies, transfers out of the practice, last data collection, the end of the study period. The primary outcome will be use of healthcare resources, and key confounders will include presence of co-morbidities, BMI, smoking status and patient-level deprivation. The second aim will examine the healthcare contacts prior to the diagnosis of psoriasis using a case-control study design in order to explore potential opportunities for earlier diagnosis. The incidence of other specific health diagnoses, symptoms, referrals and treatments leading up to diagnosis of psoriasis will be determined and incidence risk ratios calculated using regression analysis for each year prior to diagnosis from all contacts through primary and secondary care sources of individuals with and without psoriasis.",#NAME?,"Professor Darren Ashcroft - Chief Investigator - University of Manchester

Since their introduction in the United Kingdom in 2007, they have become increasingly popular. DPP-4 inhibitors lower blood sugar and do not cause weight gain or rapid drops in blood sugar levels like some other antidiabetic drugs. However, there are some reports suggesting that they may increase the risk of bullous pemphigoid, a rare but potentially life-threatening disease of the skin. To date, this possible association has not been well studied. Thus, we will investigate this possible link by using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This study will provide important information on the safety of DPP-4 inhibitors.","Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are typically used as second- to third-line treatments in the management of type 2 diabetes. While they effectively lower blood glucose via inhibition of the DPP-4 enzyme, there is some evidence that inhibiting this enzyme may generate autoimmune-related adverse events. Indeed, several case reports and few small case-control studies have suggested that use of DPP-4 inhibitors may be associated with an increased risk of bullous pemphigoid (BP), a rare blistering skin condition. However, these studies had methodological shortcomings that limit the validity of their findings. To address this question, we will assemble a cohort of approximately 170,000 patients newly-treated with antidiabetic drugs between January 2007 and March 2018. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of BP associated with use of DPP-4 inhibitors, compared with use of other second- to third-line antidiabetic drugs.

It is characterised by a narrowing of the airways making it difficult to breathe. There is currently no cure, but simple treatments can help alleviate symptoms, keeping the asthma under control.  However certain inflammatory conditions have been associated with asthma that makes it harder to manage, resulting in higher health care cost and poorer quality of life for the patient.
We want to understand the relationship between these conditions and asthma management: atopic dermatitis (a chronic skin condition associated with ""flares"" when the skin becomes very red and itchy), allergic rhinitis (typically a blocked or runny nose), chronic rhinosinusitis (where the nasal passages and sinuses become  swollen and blocked), nasal polyps (small growths in the nose causing a blockage), urticaria (hives), allergic conjunctivitis (red, itchy, teary eyes caused by an airborne irritant), food allergy (when an individual has a harmful reaction to a food)  and anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction which requires immediate medical intervention).  All these conditions have a similar inflammatory pathway as asthma but how they co-occur and what their impact is on asthma management has not been previously studied within a real-world asthma population.","Asthma is a common long-term condition which is responsible for considerable morbidity, mortality and costs. There are several related conditions, involving type 2 inflammation which have been identified as affecting asthma outcomes. The nine T2 co-morbidities of interest are: eczema, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, urticaria, allergic conjunctivitis, food allergy, eosinophilic oesophagitis and anaphylaxis. Because of the common underlying disease process, it has been suggested that successful treatment of one might also improve related conditions.
The frequency with which these conditions co-occur in patients with asthma has not yet been described, nor has the relationship between co-morbidity patterns with asthma severity and asthma-related resource utilisation.
The aim of this study is to describe the frequency and interrelations of these conditions, and assess associations with asthma severity, asthma-related healthcare resource utilisation and costs, within a real-world asthma population.
The prevalence of each co-morbidities pattern will be measured, and associations between co-morbidities described using likelihood ratios and principal component analysis. This will be used to select a subset of patterns, in which patient characteristics, asthma severity, healthcare resource utilisation and cost will be compared using multivariable regression models, in all patients and stratified by asthma severity, co-morbidity severity and activity, blood eosinophil count and age.","Phase 1

1616633840-2400,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=15,Assessing the Burden of Allergy Management in England,"Small particles such as dust, mould, pet dander, and pollen can cause allergies during a specific season or year-round. Symptoms from these types of allergies include sneezing, nasal congestion, coughing and watering or itchy eyes. Whilst not life-threatening, allergy symptoms can affect one's ability to sleep well, enjoy social activities (particularly outdoors), and perform at work and school. 

Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications; some can be purchased directly by patients from stores and pharmacies, while others require a prescription, and thus a visit to a doctor. Making such treatments available without a prescription may allow patients to access allergy medications more quickly and result in fewer doctor visits. Since many people experience allergies, this could generate large savings to the National Health Service (NHS) that could be used for the treatment of other conditions. However, there is no current information on the number of doctor visits for allergies and the number of allergy prescriptions to estimate these costs.

This study will report on patients diagnosed with and treated for allergies in England,  including their characteristics (such as age and gender), and types of medications prescribed. The costs of prescription medications and visits for allergy treatment will be estimated.","Seasonal and perennial allergies caused by pollen, dust, mould, or pet dander are one of the most common ailments in Europe, and are associated with a reduced quality of life, as well as a substantial burden to healthcare systems. Many treatments are currently available by prescription (Rx) only, therefore requiring a general practitioner (GP) visit. It is possible that switching the status of medications from Rx to over-the-counter (OTC), if appropriate, may result in greater convenience for patients and time-savings for patients and healthcare providers, freeing up healthcare resources for use in managing more complex conditions. However, the current burden of seasonal and perennial allergies in England is unknown.

This retrospective cohort study will identify and characterize patients with seasonal and perennial allergies, quantify the number of allergy-related visits and treatments prescribed, and estimate the associated healthcare resource utilisation (HRU) and costs from 2012-2016. Patients with allergies will be matched to a cohort of patients without a diagnosis or treatment for allergies by age, gender, and GP practice area, and characteristics and HRU/cost measures will be compared across cohorts using descriptive statistics. Costs will be estimated using local unit costs from published resources and adjusted for inflation.","- Allergy medication utilisation

Several research teams have tried with only partial success to use the vast amount of information held in patients' electronic health records and also information collected directly from patients to predict a future dementia diagnosis. Recently, a new technique from computer science known as machine learning has demonstrated the potential to handle very large amounts of information better than more traditional methods used in the earlier studies.

The aim of this project is to predict the risk of developing dementia from electronic health records using machine learning.
 
If successful, this will help to identify the patients most likely to benefit from treatments earlier, and provide personalised information about risk of dementia for each patient to inform shared decision-making between GPs and individuals at risk.","Systematic reviews found 21 dementia risk prediction tools for use in population-based settings, but concluded that none of them were particularly good. One tool, which used the primary care electronic health record (EHR), was developed using traditional statistical techniques and included a limited set of cross-sectional variables. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated the potential to outperform traditional prediction methods in large-scale datasets.

This project will utilise ML techniques and the longitudinal nature of EHRs to develop an improved EHR-based tool for estimating patient risk of developing dementia. The project will investigate a broad range of previously identified, newly emerging, and novel potential predictive factors, to develop predictive models using both traditional - i.e. logistic regression - and ML techniques.

The risk of OA increases with age and females are more commonly affected. Pain is managed by a number of available medicines including paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. Recently, research has highlighted the involvement of multiple pain sensation pathways in OA and proposed the role of antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs for OA related pain. Patients with OA use different medicines for varying periods in their search for pain relief which consequently results in a wide variation in medicine use, however, information on medicine use and subsequent outcomes in patients with OA in the UK are limited. This study will explore the use of pain medicines and assess related outcomes, specifically falls and death, in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) treated in GP practices in the UK. Information about patients, medicines and outcomes will be obtained from the CPRD, where prescription records will be retrieved to describe the medicines used, doses prescribed and durations, while clinical records will be retrieved to capture fall and death events. Findings from this study will inform clinical practitioners, policy makers and members of the public to collectively optimise safe use of medicines in KOA.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic condition that affects around 7 million people in the UK resulting in pain and disability that compromise quality of life and has substantial societal and economic burdens.

1616633822-2392,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=15,The role of CA125 in the detection of ovarian cancer in symptomatic primary care patients,"Ovarian cancer is the 5th most common cause of cancer related death in UK women. The majority of women are diagnosed late and only 46 out of every 100 UK women survive for 5 years after diagnosis. Early diagnosis is likely to result in better patient outcomes including survival. 

However, early diagnosis is challenging. The symptoms of ovarian cancer are vague and the same symptoms occur in non-worrying medical conditions, so it is can be difficult for GPs to decide which patients need to be sent to hospital urgently for more tests and which can be reassured. Simple blood tests, such as CA125, can be used to help GPs make these decisions. However, we don't know how good CA125 is when used in primary care or what 'cut-off point' to use for an abnormal result. 

In this study, we aim to determine how effective CA125 is at picking up cancer in women visiting their GP with symptoms which could be caused to ovarian cancer, and identify the most appropriate abnormal CA125 cut-off. This work will help GPs to make decisions regarding investigation and referral of symptomatic women.","Ovarian cancer has the worst prognosis of any gynaecological cancer. Early diagnosis is likely to improve survival, and, while symptoms occur in all stages, they are also common in benign conditions. Tests are needed to help distinguish malignant from benign disease in symptomatic patients.

The serum biomarker CA125 is frequently elevated in women with ovarian cancer. It is used as a first line investigation in primary care, in the UK and internationally, in patients presenting with symptoms that might be caused by ovarian cancer. Despite widespread use, the diagnostic accuracy of CA125 in the primary care population has not been established and the current 'abnormal threshold' (35u/ml) is not based on primary care data. 

In this prospective cohort study, we will determine the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV) of CA125 in a symptomatic primary care population and identify CA125 thresholds that equate to a range of risk thresholds (PPVs). As CA125 levels and ovarian cancer risk are influenced by patient variables, we will produce stratified thresholds based on key variables e.g. age. This work will allow GPs to make decisions about further investigation and referral based on patient risk.","Primary outcome:

Both SGLT2-RIs, (acting on the afferent arteriole to decrease the hyper-filtration) and RAAS blockade, (acting on the efferent arterioles to decrease the hyper-filtration) lead to reductions in urinary albumin secretion. Using CPRD, we aim to assess whether the combined effect of an SGLT2-RI and RAAS blockade will be additive to decrease renal outcomes. 
A retrospective cohort study design will be used to estimate the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy using the Cox regression comparing people on dual therapies vs. single therapy or no therapy. Nephropathy outcomes are defined as new onset macro albuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of renal replacement therapy or kidney related death. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses for all relevant confounding factors available in CPRD will be performed.","1. End stage renal disease (<15 GFR)

A population-based study using the CPRD,"Launched in 2009, the NHS Health Check (NHSHC) is a public health intervention aimed at identifying patients who have a high risk of developing Heart Disease, Diabetes, Kidney Disease and Stroke.  The NHSHC helps patients manage their risk by referring them to programmes aimed at enabling lifestyle changes. However, there is no definitive research into the NHSHC's effectiveness with studies suggesting that similar programmes have negligible impact on healthcare outcomes. There is currently a lack of evidence evaluating the NHSHC, leading academics to demand more research.  Whilst research has contributed information on the uptake of the NHSHC, these studies have not evaluated the long-term diabetic outcomes between participants and non-participants of the NHSHC. Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we will filter those who are eligible for the NHSHC and from this subset, we will classify patients by participation status. We will then compare Diabetic outcomes (e.g. a diagnosis for Diabetes including Chronic Kidney Disease, Diabetic Retinopathy, Diabetic Foots complications and diabetic related deaths) between eligible patients who did and did not have an NHSHC.  To generalise our findings, we will replicate this study with the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme (NHSDPP) data to evaluate Public Health Intervention's effect on Diabetic healthcare outcomes.","Background: The NHSHC and DPP are expensive population-level interventions without strong trial-based evidence of effectiveness.  Observational studies are prone to problems such as missing data, confounding and selection biases. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the programmes and compare the influence of different analytical techniques to inform future design of observational studies. 
 
Methods: Study design:  Two Retrospective Cohort studies assessing effectiveness of a) NHSC and b) DPP on diabetes health outcomes.  
 
Target populations: those eligible for a) NHSHC (2009-16) and b) DPP (2016-2018) identified through demographic and READ code variables in Up to Standard CPRD practices. 
 
Intervention identification: Dedicated READ codes for the NHSHC/DPP supplemented by previously established algorithms for the NHSHC. 
 
Outcomes:  Incidence of Diabetes diagnosis, HbA1c, Chronic Kidney Disease, Retinopathy and Foot Complications up to 5 years following the health checks.  
 
Covariates include: Urinary Albumin levels, Framingham Score, and BMI.
 
Analytical approaches: Our primary approach is to use multiple imputation for missing data and propensity score matching (PSM) to ensure similarity of ""treated"" (i.e. those undergoing interventions within the programme) and ""untreated"" groups. 

We will undertake a variety of classical and emerging epidemiological approaches to missing data, confounding and selection bias and compare predictive power of different approaches.",#NAME?,"Professor Robert Aldridge - Chief Investigator - University College London ( UCL )

There are several studies suggesting that lymphomas may be related to low cholesterol blood levels. However, this information often relies on relatively weak methodologies, such as basing results on a very small number of cholesterol measurements. On the other hand, the results of a recently published US study were the first to provide solid information on the relationship of blood cholesterol levels with the risk of suffering a lymphoma since it assessed a long period of time (10 years) before the diagnosis of lymphoma. Our proposed study intends to be the first to replicate these important findings while studying a different population (UK vs. US) and incorporating in the analyses important information about the patients that was missing in the original study (e.g., obesity, smoking, and alcohol use). The confirmation of lower blood cholesterol levels in the years before being diagnosed with a lymphoma could have potentially large public health implications given the severity and deaths related to lymphomas and the widespread availability and safety of blood cholesterol testing.","Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that originate from lymphoid organs. There are several studies suggesting an association of hypocholesterolemia and lymphoma diagnosis. However, most studies have been based on only one baseline measurement of serum cholesterol. Recent research has suggested that cholesterol metabolism may be related to lymphomagenesis.
One recently published paper with participation of an investigator of the proposed study was the first to provide information on the continuous relationship of cholesterol levels with lymphoma over the 10-year period leading to a diagnosis of lymphoma. This study used a large group of lymphoma patients identified from HMO claims data in the US. To replicate these important findings, we intend to conduct a matched case control study of a different population (UK vs. US) from a different type of secondary data (EMR vs. claims) while addressing confounders that were not available in the original study (e.g., BMI, alcohol use, smoking).

This is partly attributed to the fact that, in the UK, patients tend to be diagnosed with more advanced cancer than elsewhere. As part of a strategy to combat this, guidelines for general practitioners (GPs) were updated in 2015 advising on which patients should be referred to hospital for investigation using a fast-track system known as the ""two-week wait"" (TWW). In this study we will examine how often GPs follow the guidelines and whether certain types of patients (e.g. men/women, old/young) or patients with certain symptoms are more or less likely to be urgently referred when the guidelines suggest they should be. We will then examine whether these differences are explainable, for example due to urinary infections in women which may have the same symptom as bladder cancer. Finally, we will examine differences in following guidelines between different doctors and in different practices. By identifying what types of patients are not being referred according to guidelines we can improve education materials for doctors. If we find large variation by doctors in whether guidelines are followed it may be possible to target improvement efforts at certain doctors.","In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) released updated guidelines for recognition and referral of suspected cancer in primary care, with the intention of increasing the proportion of cancer patients being diagnosed with early stage disease. However, guidelines are only effective to the degree that they are implemented. We will examine patients identified with any of the following symptoms during 2014 to 2016: haematuria, rectal bleeding, breast lump, post-menopausal bleeding, dysphagia and anaemia, to assess the extent to which symptom-based recommendations about referrals included in NICE guidelines are followed. The guidelines for these symptoms have remained largely unchanged in the updated guidelines. Patients are included whether or not they are subsequently diagnosed with cancer, reflecting that at initial presentation a diagnosis has not been made. It is important to examine guideline implementation among all patients for which urgent referral is mandated, not only those subsequently found to have cancer. Mixed effects models will be used to assess the variability in adherence to guidelines between patient groups, presenting symptoms and between practices/GPs. Haematuria in women will provide an exemplar condition, to examine how often apparent guideline discordance is justified by firm evidence of alternative diagnosis (urinary tract infection-related antibiotic prescription/retesting).

Before 2011, national guidance recommended offering antibiotics to women undergoing CS after the umbilical cord was cut, to reduce the risk of the mother developing an infection. However, evidence showed that the earlier antibiotics were given, the less likely mothers were to develop an infection. Therefore, in 2011 the guidance changed to recommend giving antibiotics before the operation.

Antibiotics given to the mother before CS also reach the baby via the placenta. We do not know whether these antibiotics have any long-term impact on children's health. During and after birth, the newborn gut is colonised by bacteria which are believed to be important in development of the child's immune system. The bacteria differ between babies who do and do not receive antibiotics during a CS, which may affect their chances of developing health conditions such as asthma, eczema and food allergies.

This study will investigate whether there is any long-term impact of antibiotics given at the time of CS on children's health. Findings will help women and their families make informed decisions before CS regarding whether or not, and how, they wish to receive antibiotics before their baby is born.","Aim: 
To investigate whether the change in NICE guidance in 2011 from recommending prophylactic antibiotics after cord clamping to pre-incision antibiotics has had any effect on incidence of allergic and other related health conditions in children born by Caesarean Section (CS). 

Design: 
A controlled interrupted time-series study using mother-baby linked data from UK primary care (CPRD). 

Target population: 
Children born in the UK during 2006-2018 delivered by CS, compared to a control cohort delivered vaginally. 

Intervention and comparator: 
In utero exposure to prophylactic antibiotics immediately prior to delivery by CS will be compared to no exposure when given after the cord was clamped at CS. Exposure to intra-partum antibiotics is not routinely recorded in the UK, but nearly all (98%) women undergoing CS receive prophylactic antibiotics. We will use findings from a national survey of hospitals regarding change in timing of antibiotic administration as an indicator of the probability of exposure. We will account for the cumulative increase of hospitals giving pre-incision antibiotics in our analysis.

Outcomes: 
Primary: Asthma and eczema. 
Secondary: Other allergic and allergy related diseases, autoimmune diseases, infections and inflammation, other immune system related conditions, healthcare utilisation; maternal postpartum infectious morbidity, to assess whether the effects of pre-incision antibiotics demonstrated in randomised trials can be replicated using routine data.","Primary Outcomes: Examine whether in-utero exposure to antibiotics immediately prior to birth (Intervention) compared to no pre-incisional antibiotic exposure (Comparator) in children born by caesarean section increases

Secondary outcomes - children: We will investigate the effect of pre-incision prophylactic antibiotics in children born by CS on
- Other allergic and allergy related diseases (food allergies and intolerance, allergic rhinitis
- Autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, other systemic connective tissue disorders)
- Infections and inflammation (e.g. neonatal sepsis, wheeze, respiratory tract infections, respiratory conditions, gastroenteritis)

- Healthcare utilisation (overall consultation frequency in primary care, hospital admissions)
- Less specific measures of child health (colic, failure to thrive)
- Other outcomes suggested by clinicians and parents may be added, for instance neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, ADHD)


Secondary outcomes - mothers: We will investigate if the effects of a reduction in post-partum maternal infectious morbidity shown in randomised controlled trials outside the UK can be replicated in the UK using routine healthcare data

In the absence of such trials, routinely collected data can be used to provide evidence of relative benefit and safety of clinical interventions. 

However, since subjects in real-life clinical practice are not randomized but receive the interventions based up on their clinical profile, those receiving different treatments differ in their clinical characteristics. Differences in outcomes between the groups who received one intervention versus the group who did not receive the intervention (or who received a different intervention) may be explained by differences in baseline risk factors and not just the intervention. Hence, one has to account for differences in baseline characteristics to be able to know the effect of the intervention. 

Furthermore, the benefit and safety of interventions may not be the same for every patient; some group of patients (e.g. males) might get more benefit compared to others (e.g. females). To evaluate the presence of such subgroup effects, one has to look in to the effect of the interventions with in each subgroup using statistical techniques known as propensity score and disease risk score methods.

In this study, we plan to use routinely collected data from CPRD to evaluate statistical methods to evaluate subgroups effect of medications or surgical interventions while accounting for differences in baseline characteristics.","Propensity score (PS) and disease risk score (also called prognostic score, DRS) methods are popular methods to account for confounding in observational studies. In evaluating effect modification in studies of drug effects or surgical interventions, treatment effect is estimated within subgroups of the effect modifier after propensity score matching (PSM). While, PSM improves balance on covariates included in the PS model, such balance cannot be assured within strata of a covariate, for example a potential effect modifier, unless further matching is done using that specific covariate. A recent literature review showed that many studies do not account for the fact that creating subgroups using a covariate, an effect modifier, will break the covariate balance created on the full PS matched set. However, the impact of the imbalance on the bias of the estimated treatment effect is not studied. In addition, alternative methods such as matching using the PS and the effect modifier or combining DRS methods and PS to evaluate effect modification has not been investigated using empirical data.","- Type 2 diabetes

The data generated by general practitioners (GPs) who keep their patients' medical records on computers can be very useful for medical research, but the quality of the data must be demonstrated first. Without evidence of data quality, the use of data collected primarily for patient care in research may be scientifically questionable. Since the data in the CPRD Aurum database were not originally designed to be used for research it is particularly important to assess their quality and completeness. We propose a thorough data quality assessment study using multiple strategies to evaluate the different types of data collected in the database before using them for research purposes. We will compare information in CPRD Aurum to information in a hospital database to see if the data in Aurum are complete. We will also look to see if medications recorded in the electronic record match the diagnoses recorded by the GPs and if the diagnoses are supported by the treatments they receive.","We will use several data quality assessment techniques to assess the quality and completeness of the CPRD Aurum data.

However, patients with ID are not identified as a high-risk group and their routine health check does not address bone health. The underestimate of these patients' fracture risk probably stems from the lack of UK specific data, and from the limited knowledge on risk factors for fractures in these patients.  
Study proposal Using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked databases, we'll compare rates of fractures between patients with ID and the general UK population and examine risk factors for fractures in these patients. This will allow us to design a fracture risk assessment tool specific for people with ID. This is important because the currently available fracture risk assessment tools do not take into account risk factors for fractures which are common in these patients. As our study results will help identify patients with ID at risk of fractures, available prevention strategies could be used to reduce the incidence of these events in these patients.","Despite evidence from other countries of increased fracture risk in patients with intellectual disabilities (ID), UK based epidemiological data is lacking and the risk factors for fractures in these patients are not clearly established. 
In a Fracture Incidence Study, we will compare the rates of a) all fractures, b) fragility fractures and c) hip fractures between patients with ID and general population subjects in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).

In a Fracture Risk Assessment Study, we'll investigate all the predictors included in the most recent available version of Qfracture, a fracture risk calculator for the general population recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, and additional potential risk factors more specific to ID patients. These will include cause of ID (e.g. Down's syndrome), associated illnesses (e.g. cerebral palsy), medication (e.g. antipsychotics), and others. We will construct and validate a fracture risk assessment tool using a derivation cohort and a validation cohort within the CPRD. Two thirds of the CPRD practices will be randomly assigned to the derivation dataset, on which we will construct the model using Cox regression analysis, and one third to the validation dataset, by which we will evaluate its predictive accuracy.",#NAME?,"Dr Valeria Frighi - Chief Investigator - University of Oxford

There are a few different methods of treating PCa, however, they are linked to possible side-effects, some of which could have negative long-term effects on the patients. One of the most important complications is incontinence of urine (IU). It is a benign medical disease which could cause dramatic mental and social impact. It is also very costly for the NHS. IU following treatment of PCa is often caused by surgical removal of the gland. However, other forms of treatments of PCa can also lead to incontinence. The need for medical research to reduce this common side effect is increasing, yet we were unable to locate England or UK specific records of the number of males suffering from urinary incontinence in the general population or among males diagnosed with PCa. The aim of this study is to; document the burden of IU in the male population, determine the number of incontinence within patients with previous diagnosis of PCa, highlight the number of patients developing IU with each method of treatment of PCa and finally to estimate the financial cost of this condition.","The aim of this study is to determine the proportion of incontinence of urine (IU) in the general male population of UK and document the prevalence of this complication following treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) in a representative English population. This will provide support for decision making in treating PCa and will be a reference for further related incontinence studies. We will start by identifying the prevalence of IU in the male population. The next step will be identifying patients with PCa who developed IU resulting from either PCa diagnosis without treatment or as a complication of their treatment.  The prevalence of IU associated with treatment of PCa in England will be calculated and compared to prevalence of IU in England. Descriptive statistical analysis will be used to document the frequency, whereas different modalities of treatments for IU will be compared using One-way ANOVA test to documents the rates variability. The study will also estimate the cost of the development of IU following PCa treatment to determine the financial impact on the health care system.",#NAME?,"Mr Ismail Omar - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

In most cases, the disease shows no signs or symptoms; however, if left untreated, patients with this disease can get heart disease by the age of 40. Evidence shows that this disease is under-diagnosed; and the medicines that are currently used to treat it are not effective in some people.

A new type of medicine, technically referred to as 'PCSK9 inhibitors', has been launched for the treatment of this disease. This new type of medicine is more effective than currently available medicines; and may potentially be used to treat patients who are not adequately treated.   

Several studies have used patient records with the aim of improving the detection of FH. The findings show that it is possible to determine patients with this disease based on their healthcare records. 
 
This study will focus on the association between FH patients' clinical characteristics and the achievement of effective treatment. The aim of the study is to develop a method to predict if a patient would need this new type of medicine.","The objective of this study is to develop and validate a mathematical model that can predict the therapeutic outcome of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients who are taking the currently recommended treatments.

These bacteria are important for digestion and overall health. Antibiotic treatment can disturb the gut microbiota and kill many of the bacteria in the gut. There is scientific evidence that suggests that disturbance of the gut microbiota could reduce the effectiveness of chemotherapy and immunotherapy for cancers (i.e., medicines that kill dividing cells such as cancer cells in the body). This evidence examined the effects of antibiotics on microbiota in either mice or tissues. There is limited evidence in humans about whether antibiotics affect the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy.
This study aims to use UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to evaluate the association between recent use of antibiotics and their impact on overall mortality of recently diagnosed cancer patients. Patients who had been previously exposed to oral and/or intravenous antibiotics with no cancer history from 2000, with at least 3 years of follow-up after the data collection, and who developed incident cancer, will be our cases. We will evaluate the proportion of cases who die after the diagnosis of cancer.

After lifestyle changes, patients are prescribed tablets to control the average blood glucose level (HbA1C).  In general, patients are initially prescribed with single drug or therapy and only if the blood glucose levels do not decline over time, they are prescribed with multiple drugs or therapy. 
We believe that patients with HbA1C level equal to or higher than 9% may benefit from starting on combination of different drugs rather than a single drug (i.e., monotherapy).
In this study we want to determine the number of patients who have a high HbA1C level (>9%) when they initiate medication, and of those how many patients initiate treatment with single drug and how many with a combination of drugs. 
Additionally, we will follow the patients until 24 months after they initiate medication for T2DM, to compare the HbA1C levels achieved between those starting with multiple drugs to those starting with single drug. We will also look at how much time is taken for the patients to reach a lower HbA1c level (<7%) from the initial high HbA1c level.","The study analysis will include T2DM patients, aged 18 years and older, using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database.

Patients with continuous enrolment in the database one year prior to the index date, having an HbA1c lab value between 3 months before to 2 weeks after index date will be included. Patients will be excluded if they had type 1 diabetes mellitus, other forms of secondary diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, or had taken any antidiabetic drugs in the one-year baseline period.

Patients with prescription for 2 or more different antidiabetic agents in the first month post index date (with at least 1 follow-up prescription for each agent) will be defined as combination therapy initiators. 

We will evaluate the longitudinal change in HbA1c levels, at 12 months and 24 months from the baseline levels as well the time taken to achieve target HbA1c level of <7%.

Body mass index, a measure of overall body fat, is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared (kg/m2).
Obesity is rising in the UK, leading to growing concerns over its long-term impact on health. As such, health care professionals are working on ways to prevent, manage and reverse this problem. Changes in weight lead to changes in the factors that affect the risk of heart disease and diabetes. There is, however, not enough evidence of the effect of weight changes among overweight and obese people, on the future risk of developing heart disease. It is also not known whether the risk of death varies among different subgroups of these individuals diagnosed with type-2 diabetes 
This study aims to use patient records to determine the effect of changes in body mass index over a specified period on the risk of having a heart attack or type-2-diabetes in patients who are obese or overweight. Also, the risk of death after a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes will be determined. Findings from this study will provide new knowledge and guidance on the effect of body mass index changes on the risk these disease conditions, as well as help clinicians effectively manage these group of patients.","Background: Existing evidence indicate changes in weight lead to changes in the risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type-2-diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there is insufficient knowledge of the effects of body mass index (BMI) changes on the overall risk of CVD and T2DM in overweight/obese patients.

Objectives: 
1.	To identify BMI change patterns over time in obese and overweight individuals 
2.	To determine the relationship between distinct BMI trajectories and CVD and T2DM outcomes 
Study design: Cohort design

Setting: UK General Practice

Participants: Adult patients free from CVD or T2DM at baseline, registered for at least one year before the study start date, with a baseline BMI of 25kg/m2 or greater and minimum of 3 BMI readings during the study period.

Outcome: Incident CVD and T2DM diagnosis 
Methods: For each patient, 4 measurements of BMI over a 10 year period will be collected (at baseline, 2, 5 and 10 years). Using latent class analysis, distinct BMI trajectory groups will be identified and the relationship between BMI trajectories with CVD and T2DM assessed.
Outputs: Distinct BMI trajectories for overweight and obese patients. Significance and effect of the association between BMI trajectories and CVD as well as T2DM.","Primary outcome

1616633775-2373,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=16,Defining different recovery trajectories following acute infections as a measure of frailty,"The ability of patients to recover from acute illness like an infection does not depend on a patient's age but their frailty. Frailty is the vulnerability to a more severe response to an acute challenge or illness. The ability to predict who is frail by this definition is critical to understand which patients would benefit from detailed assessment of needs and support, and this would inform future decisions about appropriate interventions or treatments.

Current methods to predict frailty have not modelled frailty as the vulnerability to poor recovery from an acute illness, but instead are risk scores which are based on their ability to predict broad outcomes from a fixed time point. This means that current methods to identify frailty are inaccurate and of limited value. This project will assess the feasibility of defining frailty as a vulnerability to a poor recovery after an acute infection by studying the factors that predict the different patient recovery trajectories following urine or chest infections, using anonymised patient health records. Using this method, the findings will be translatable to patient records commonly used within community healthcare and will lead to the development of better clinical tools to predict patients with frailty.","This proposal will reframe the concept of frailty by assessing the different patient recovery trajectories following a urine or respiratory community acquired infection 2005-2015. This will develop a framework for future frailty research that has true construct validity. Open population based cohorts will be used within routine healthcare data to map the different recovery trajectories across different dimensions. These will include consultation rates, prescription rates, diagnosis rates, specific diagnostic codes, sequences of codes, location of health care interactions (inpatient, community, care home), and mortality. Changes in each dimension from baseline will be assessed over time using within patient case series analysis. To efficiently and systematically identify the most common ordered sequences of events from many potential combinations sequential pattern mining will be used. These different recovery trajectories will then be stratified by pre-existing co-morbidity and frailty measures, and the characteristics of patients in each trajectory will be described. A Cox proportional hazards model will be used to adjust for the competing risks between the multiple different trajectories using cumulative incidence functions. This model will then be used to calculate the association of pre-existing the co-morbidity and frailty measures with each recovery trajectory.",#NAME?,"Dr Colin Crooks - Chief Investigator - University of Nottingham

The shingles vaccine is offered to older individuals to protect against shingles; however, individuals with immunosuppression are not eligible to receive the shingles vaccine. 

Uptake of vaccines is monitored nationally, to check how well each vaccination programme is doing and that individuals at high risk of infection are being protected. However, the current monitoring system has difficulty in counting all individuals who are eligible and ineligible for vaccination, particularly those who have immunosuppression.

This study will use anonymous GP data (medical diagnoses and information on prescribed medicines that affect the immune system) to better quantify how many people are eligible to receive PPV and how many are ineligible to receive shingles vaccination. The proportion of these individuals who receive PPV or shingles vaccine will then be estimated. The results will strengthen our understanding of how well the vaccination programmes for these two vaccines are working and will help inform future campaigns to increase vaccine uptake.","The national immunisation programme in England includes vaccines against pneumococcal disease and against herpes zoster. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) is offered to individuals aged 2-64 years in specific clinical risk groups and to all individuals aged 65+ years. The live zoster vaccine is offered to selected older age groups but cannot be given to those with immunosuppression. 

National monitoring of vaccine uptake currently involves automatic extraction and uploading of anonymised GP data on vaccine-eligible individuals and their vaccine uptake.  Identification of eligible/ineligible individuals for vaccination and their vaccine uptake is based entirely on Read codes, but these codes cannot fully capture specific risk groups such as those with drug-induced immunosuppression.

This study will use anonymised CPRD data (including both medical and drug codes) to better quantify the clinical risk groups for PPV and those ineligible for zoster vaccine and will estimate vaccine uptake in each group. This will provide more robust estimates of PPV uptake in clinical risk groups, and the extent of inadvertent zoster vaccine uptake in the immunosuppressed.  As a secondary objective, the proportion inadvertently receiving zoster vaccine who develop varicella-zoster disease after vaccination will also be estimated.",#NAME?,"Dr Helen McDonald - Chief Investigator - London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM )

Such declines are associated with undesirable effects. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has become a popular way of treating this condition, with the use of TRT increasing dramatically over the last two decades. However, the diagnosis and treatment of low testosterone levels is controversial. Moreover, there are concerns that the use of TRT might increase the risk of prostate cancer. To date, studies investigating this link have been limited and conflicting. Thus, to address this safety concern, this study will investigate whether the use of TRT is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The findings from this study will provide much needed information regarding TRT and prostate safety, which can help better inform on the risks and benefits of this therapy.","There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between the use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and the incidence of prostate cancer. Indeed, some observational studies suggest an association, while others demonstrate safety with regards to the prostate. However, these studies had important limitations, complicating the interpretation of their findings. Given the prevalence of testosterone deficiency and the increasing use of TRT, further studies are needed to evaluate this association. Thus, this study will investigate the association between TRT and prostate cancer by assembling a cohort of 15,000 men newly-diagnosed with age-related hypogonadism between 1 January 1995 and 31 August 2016, and followed until 31 August 2017. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of prostate cancer associated with the use of TRT, compared with non-use.

For patients with milder disease their disorder can be managed within primary care. However, for patients with more severe disease, according to clinical guidelines, they should also receive additional input from asthma specialists. This study aims to assess if patients with more severe asthma are being appropriately referred to asthma specialists.

Most asthma patients have mild disease, which does not require much healthcare input, but the needs of the smaller proportion that have more severe disease, are likely to contribute a huge proportion of asthma patients' healthcare needs. Therefore, this study aims to assess the amount of healthcare utilisation asthma patients require, the differences between those with milder or more severe disease, and the difference between those that were or were not referred to secondary care.

This study will provide an understanding of the healthcare needs of patients with more severe asthma and establish if they are receiving appropriate management within secondary care, and the impact of that on their primary care management.","We will identify a cohort of asthma patients that should be referred for specialist respiratory management, according to clinical guidelines or Royal College of Physicians recommendations.

Strategies to better control this disease must include predisposing factors. One of these factors is smoking and a significant proportion of asthmatics are smokers. Despite the logical expectation that people with asthma would avoid exposure to cigarette smoke, studies suggest that smoking behaviour is prevalent among asthmatics at a rate similar or higher to that found in the general population.
Cigarette smoke triggers tightening of the lungs (bronchoconstriction) in asthmatic patients. Smoking asthmatics have more severe breathing problems, worse quality of life and a faster loss of breathing ability compared to non-smoking asthmatics. They are also more likely to have emergency room visits and are at a higher risk of dying following hospitalization for near-fatal asthma events.
Despite the importance of smoking as a factor in asthma, clinical trials studying new drugs for asthma generally exclude smokers. 
We are interested in examining smoking asthma patients' response to specific classes of inhaler drugs called inhaled corticosteroids.  We aim to determine if there are differences in response between smokers and non-smokers, which would identify an unmet need that could be addressed by new asthma medications.","The primary objective is to compare the time to treatment failure from first initiating inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or fixed dose inhaled corticosteroids/long acting beta agonists (FD ICS/LABA) treatment in smoking asthmatics and matched non-smoking asthmatics. Treatment failure will be defined as increased treatment dose, prescription of additional maintenance therapy, episode of moderate or severe asthma exacerbation or excessive use of short acting beta agonists (SABA).

If left untreated, AF can damage the heart leading to serious health conditions such as stroke.

The risk of stroke in patients with AF can be reduced with drugs called anticoagulants, for example warfarin, which requires patients to achieve and maintain a level of blood clotting considered safe and effective. This requires regular monitoring at considerable expense to patients and the healthcare sector. Patient factors related to achieving good or bad levels of anticoagulation control are not adequately understood.

This study aims to use patient data routinely collected from general practices and hospitals to examine the relationship between the characteristics of patients with AF receiving warfarin (such as age, blood pressure etc.) and their level of anticoagulation control. This information will be used to explore whether patient factors can predict good or poor anticoagulation control, and thereby help to identify those that could benefit from alternative treatments to warfarin or better treatment management, thus reducing the chance of stroke. This study also aims to quantify the clinical and economic burden associated with poor anticoagulation control.","The effectiveness of warfarin as an anticoagulant is dependent on patients remaining within a narrow therapeutic range based on the International Normalised Ratio (INR). Patients receiving warfarin who are observed to not be stable within this range, or with high or low measurements, may require better management or switching to an alternative oral anticoagulant (OAC). However, outcomes could be improved if such instability could be accurately predicted at the time of anticoagulation initiation, before the patient receives warfarin.

The aim of this retrospective observational study is to evaluate empirical models that can be used in clinical practice for the prediction of anticoagulation control prior to warfarin initiation following AF. Using CPRD and linked HES data, various definitions of anticoagulation control will be explored, and the predictive performance of classical statistical models will be compared to that of machine learning techniques utilising baseline and time-varying covariates. Exploratory analyses will be used to explore clustering and temporal patterns in variables identified as risk factors for poor anticoagulation control. This study also aims to quantify the clinical and economic burden associated with poor anticoagulation control (incidence rates of all-cause mortality, clinical events and hospitalisations), using appropriate statistical techniques to adjust for observed confounders.","The primary health outcomes to be measured in this research protocol are:

Identifying groups at high risk of dementia will be important.  Individuals who are widowed appear to have a higher risk of developing dementia; however this association has not been assessed in the UK. The reasons for this association are unknown. It may be due to the bereaved experiencing stress because of the loss of their partner, or bereavement leading to an increase in other dementia risk factors, such as social isolation.  This study will aim to clarify whether partner bereavement has an effect on the risk of being diagnosed with dementia and identify factors that may explain this association. We will use data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to compare the risk of dementia among persons who have lost their partner with the risk among persons who have not lost their partner.","Given the rapid growth of the ageing population and the anticipated increase in dementia cases globally, identifying those who are at high-risk of the condition may be useful to help target preventive dementia strategies. Partner bereavement has been associated with an increased risk of dementia; however, this association has not been well-described using UK-based data. This study will build on the existing evidence base to better understand to what extent partner bereavement affects the development, and diagnosis of, dementia and what are the main factors mediating the association. We will use a matched cohort study to examine if partner bereavement is associated with the onset of diagnosed dementia among heterosexual couples. Partners will be defined as two persons with (1) the same family number, (2) opposite sex, (3) an age gap of </= 10 years and (4) no younger adult in the household within 15 years of either of the couple. We will then identify all deaths occurring in the couples during 1997-2018 and the bereaved partner will be classified as exposed. The date of partner bereavement will be considered the index date. Next, we will randomly match each exposed person by age and sex to a non-exposed person. Persons in the matched cohort have to be alive and have a partner but without ever-experiencing previous partner bereavement on the index date for the matched exposed person. Using stratified Cox regression, we will compute hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the association between partner bereavement and dementia. We will examine if associations vary by characteristics of the bereaved, such as gender and age.",#NAME?,"Dr Harriet Forbes - Chief Investigator - London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM )

It is not known, however, if South Asians experienced the same improvements. Moreover, following a diseases of the heart and blood vessel, the probability of death is greater for patients with diabetes compared to those without. However, it is not known whether the increased risk of death in patients with diabetes is different according to the ethnicity. 
Using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), this study aims to investigate the age at onset of several diseases of the heart and blood vessels and survival differences after the onset of these diseases comparing subjects with and without diabetes for Whites, South Asians, Blacks, and other ethnicities.

SGLT2 inhibitors work by limiting the amount of sodium that is reabsorbed back into the body through the kidney. Instead of being reabsorbed back into the body, the extra sugar is excreted in the urine. Although these medications are studied extensively prior to being approved, the extent to which they cause unintended side effects, especially when they are used in real life conditions is not well known. Multiple federal regulatory agencies, such as Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration, have published warnings regarding several potential harms. Given the increasing use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, further evaluation of their post-marketing safety is required. We propose to study the real-world safety of SGLT2 inhibitors using large databases that contain detailed healthcare records for individuals with type 2 diabetes.","Objective: To measure the association between use of the sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) inhibitors for the management of type 2 diabetes and safety outcomes. 
Methods: We propose to conduct a series of population-based cohort studies using information from everyday health system encounters. We will quantify the risk of several important safety outcomes among metformin monotherapy initiators who subsequently start a second agent. Within each database, separate cohorts of propensity score matched new users of SGLT2 inhibitors and new users of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors will be formed. We will then compare the adjusted population-based rates of: 1) acute kidney injury, 2) composite of new or worsening nephropathy, 3) fragility fractures, 4) composite of lower limb amputations, 5) ketoacidosis, 6) composite of urinary tract infections, 7) composite of genital infections, 8) composite of all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations. 
Data analysis: We will use proportional hazards regression models with fixed and time-dependent variables to precisely define both drug exposures and confounders, and to determine if SGLT2 inhibitors are independently associated with a change in risk in these safety outcomes. Analyses will be conducted separately in multiple databases and then each estimate will be combined using random-effects meta-analysis.",#NAME?,"Dr John-Michael Gamble - Chief Investigator - University Of Waterloo

They occur when the body does not recognise its own tissues and attacks them. This results in painful blisters and open sores. When the mouth is affected the extreme pain causes difficulty in eating and drinking. There is no cure only treatment that aims to control symptoms. 

Steroid tablets are commonly used to control the symptoms but they can cause very serious side effects, including thinning bones and fractures, diabetes and infections. There is an urgent need to conduct high quality trials to find better treatments but, because the conditions are rare, we first need to establish how many patients there would be to take part in the trials and how they are currently treated. 

We will use the CPRD to find out how many people would be available to take part in future trials. 
This study will show how many people in the UK have developed bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris in the last 20 years, the dose and length of time people are prescribed steroid tablets, any reasons why they could not take part in a trial.","Bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris are serious autoimmune blistering skin conditions associated with high risk of death and can last for several years. The most common treatment for these diseases is steroid tablets which control the symptoms, but can cause serious side effects including infections and diabetes. Recent research has shown alternative treatment may be effective and safe. Further trials are required but before developing them it is necessary to know the number of eligible patients and what standard care is, in the UK. We will use the CPRD and linked HES to determine the prevalence, incidence, prescription patterns and number of eligible patients to be conducted in future trials on BP and PV. We will use Poisson regression modelling to determine adjusted incidence rate ratios by calendar year, age group, gender, geographical region and socioeconomic group.

Since their release less than 6 years ago, SGLT2 inhibitors have become increasingly popular, as they effectively lower blood sugar levels without the side effects of other antidiabetic drugs. However, there are some concerns that these drugs may increase the risk of fractures. Indeed, in the elderly population, fractures pose a severe health risk, as they are frequently associated with other serious complications and may even lead to death. To date, no observational study has been conducted to determine whether the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of fracture. Thus, using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we will assemble a large group of patients with type 2 diabetes to address this important safety question. This study will provide much needed information on the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors, and will be of value to regulatory agencies, physicians, and patients.","Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of drugs for type 2 diabetes. These drugs work by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidneys, increasing urinary glucose output to maintain optimal glycemic levels. While SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with favourable effects, including a low risk of hypoglycemia, there are concerns that these drugs may increase the risk of important adverse events. After reviewing safety data from pre-marketing trials, regulatory agencies expressed concerns that use of SGLT2 inhibitors may increase fracture risk. However, post-marketing trials of SGLT2 inhibitors have produced mixed findings. Although the mechanism supporting an increase in fractures is not entirely understood, it may be explained by elevated serum phosphate levels associated with increased tubular reabsorption, or by a reduction in bone mineral density.

We will assemble a cohort of approximately 80,000 patients newly-treated with antidiabetic drugs between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017, with follow-up until March 31, 2018. Current use of SGLT2 inhibitors will be modelled as a time-varying variable.

Hypertension affects approximately 1 billion adults worldwide. The level of BP is used to classify the severity of hypertension and to determine the treatment goal (i.e., target BP level). The threshold of above measurements have changed over time. Following recent changes in guidelines1, more patients will initiate medications, and will be prescribed with lower target BP levels. However, some aspects of guidelines are only supported by expert opinion, without supporting clinical evidence. Therefore, it is important to generate related evidence using real-world data. To facilitate the practice of personalized medicine, we will identify a BP control plan using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. All patients who initiated any antihypertensive therapy between 1998 and 2017 will be included. We will first describe the treatment pattern over time and compare the rate of heart diseases within each treatment pattern. We will investigate whether targeting a lower BP level delays and prevents more events of heart diseases compared with higher BP level for treatment-naive patients at low risk. Finally, a personalized BP control plan will be identified.","The level of BP is used to classify the severity of hypertension and to determine treatment goals (i.e., target BP level), both of which have changed over time. Treatment guidelines were recently revised to incorporate the results from two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ACCORD2 and SPRINT3. However, those studies failed to investigate the beneficial target BP level for patients at low cardiovascular (CVD) risk. Therefore, it is urgent to investigate the benefits of tight BP control among patients at low CVD risk and generate a personalized dynamic BP control plan for such patients. We will conduct a retrospective, population-based cohort study. We will identify all hypertensive patients with no previous history of CVD events who initiated an antihypertensive prescription from 1998-2018. Treatment patterns will be generated from class level (i.e., thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors). We will assign each patient to follow different BP control plans. The time to event hazard (i.e., major cardiovascular event, major coronary disease event, death from any cause) will be compared among different plans.

Using data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we will examine whether the use of incretin-based drugs is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. Because lung cancer is associated with low survival rates, results from this population-based study will provide important information on the safety of these drugs.","Incretin-based drugs, which include dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, are second- to third-line therapies used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Annual prevalence of preschool wheeze will be calculated and stratified by age, gender, and co-diagnosis of asthma using validated asthma Read codes. Patients with be identified by the presence of one or more Read codes for wheeze. Patients will be described in terms of demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment, at 5 different calendar years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2017) to inform on differences over the past two decades. A cohort design will be used to estimate the rate of progression of preschool wheeze to school-age asthma, and the ages at which progression occurs. Determinants that may increase the rate of progression will be assessed; these will include demographics (e.g. age, birth weight), clinical characteristics (e.g. atopy, bronchiolitis), or treatment given (e.g. inhaled steroids). A Poisson regression model will be used to estimate rates for each variables, allowing adjustment for all other covariates.",#NAME?,"Professor Jennifer Quint - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

Compared to people without diabetes, people with diabetes are more likely to develop diseases in the heart and blood vessels (i.e. cardiovascular diseases), kidney, nerves and eyes, and have a higher risk of death. 
In the last two decades there have been significant improvements in the treatment of diabetes. This has resulted in a reduced risk of death and therefore a longer life expectancy compared to people who received a diagnosis of diabetes in 1980s and 1990s. However, a reduced mortality also occurred in people without diabetes; as such, it is not clear, particularly in UK, whether the improvement has been greater in people with or without diabetes. 
This study aims to examine the risk of death in people with and without diabetes over the last two decades and assess whether the risk of death improved equally in people with and without diabetes.","Using data collected in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Gold database with linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS), we will investigate changes in the mortality rate of diabetic patients in the time period 1998 - 2018 and compare these to non-diabetic patients. The cohort will include diabetic participants identified within CPRD (exposed participants) along with a randomly selected sample of one million non-diabetic patients (non-exposed participants). The outcomes are all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer deaths, identified via linkage to ONS.

It affects 5-10% of the adult population. OSA patients are more likely to get beta-blocker treatment (a type of cardiac medication) because of co-existing conditions of hypertension, chest pain, heart attack, abnormal heart rhythm and chronic heart failure. However beta blockers may increase or decrease the risk of sudden death in OSA patients. The proposed study is to investigate whether the use of beta-blockers is associated with harm or benefit when given to OSA patients using the UK routinely collected primary care health data. The results will answer an important research question of the role of beta-blockers in OSA patients and provide solid evidence in helping decision making of clinical practice in term of drug management in OSA patients.","Methods: This is a population-based cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database. Patients with OSA who were prescribed at least two prescriptions of beta-blockers between 1986 and 2016 will form the exposure cohort. A propensity score matched cohort (1:2 matching) will be selected from patients who were not prescribed beta-blockers. The primary outcome will be sudden death during the follow up time. The secondary outcomes will include pacemaker insertion, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cancer and all-cause mortality.
Data analysis: Cox proportional hazards regression models will be used to determine the association between the use of beta-blockers and the study outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses will be carried out. In the multivariate models the hazard ratios will be adjusted for all known covariates. The results will be expressed as hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We will also perform a number of sensitivity analyses to address missing data and to make sure the results are robust.","-	Sudden death

Discovery of anti-viral medicines resulted in a better outlook for people infected with this virus. Newer medicines have since built upon these earlier treatments and these newer medicines mean that people infected with the virus have essentially a normal life expectancy. Since life expectancy is extended, the pattern of illness in HIV infected people has probably changed, and this will result in differing costs of care. The purpose of this study is to characterise any changes in outcome and treatment cost in the UK.","Anti-retroviral medicines have evolved over time to the extent that people infected with HIV now survive to full life expectancy. The proposed study is hypothesis generating using a retrospective, cohort design, and intended to provide baseline values to design further studies. Whilst we focus on determining the costs of treating those who are infected with HIV, we will also generate reference values from the general population using matched cases. The primary objective of the study is to characterise the NHS resource use and costs of care of treating people with HIV.

This type of rash starts in early childhood, may change in severity throughout the years. In some patients, it may be triggered by an allergic reaction to certain protein contained in cows' milk known as cows' milk allergy (CMA). Anytime an allergic reaction occurs, the body releases certain natural chemicals in response. Natural chemicals in the body that fight infection usually respond rapidly and can potentially involve a severe, life-threatening condition. 

To understand the evolution of AD and CMA in children and its burden on the health care system, we propose to examine a group of patients with minimum age of 5 AND who have both a diagnosis of AD and CMA, who are prescribed CMA medication. We would like to determine how these patients utilise healthcare resources as they grow older. Thus, we could formulate the pathway these patients navigate in the UK health system.","The primary objective of this study is to describe the pathway of AD/CMA patients in terms of interaction with and burden upon the healthcare system. This burden will be measured by interactions with both Primary and Secondary care.

Patients with an age of 5 years and over from a HES-linked practice with any recorded read code diagnosis of AD AND any product used to treat CMA from the list included. The study period will be from 5 years, from April 2012 to March 2017. The index date for inclusion of a patient shall be the first diagnosis of AD and prescription of a CMA product within the study period.

However, recent clinical trials showed that use of diclofenac may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine used for anxiety disorders, skin conditions (such as itch, eczema or rash) and sleep disorders. Clinical and post-marketing data both suggest its use may be associated with irregular heart beat and consequential serious heart disease. The European Medicines Agency has introduced new measures relating to the use of these drugs, aiming to minimise cardiovascular risks.  The main elements of these were that they should not be used in patients with a history of heart attack, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease and/or stroke, and should be used with caution in patients with high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes mellitus. Restrictions were introduced relating to the dose, duration and age of patients taking these medicines.  The aim of this study is to determine how these regulatory actions have impacted on the use of these drugs and management of patients in the UK.","A population-based longitudinal observational study will be conducted using data from the CPRD database to examine trends in the prescribing of these drugs.

Infections outside the brain that affect large parts of the body as well as drugs used to treat bacterial infections have also been associated with seizures. The severity of infections can be assessed by measuring inflammatory markers in blood, and these markers have been associated with the severity of seizures occurring during fever (febrile seizures) in children. It is, however, not clear whether the severity of infections as measured by these inflammatory markers is also associated with the risk of seizures in older children or in adults. This study aims to assess the risk of seizures in patients with various levels of inflammatory markers.

Despite this, very few large studies have attempted to describe what happens to people after they receive a diagnosis of dementia. 

We aim to describe the healthcare experience of people with dementia from the time they are diagnosed until their death. To do this we will bring together the different information held in nationwide databases from GPs, hospital admissions, cancer and death registries. 

We will identify different clinical pathways experienced by dementia patients, including those within established clinical sub-groups of dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's, vascular dementia). We also want to describe how dementia interacts with other health conditions common in older people; for example dementia in patients with type-2 diabetes or stroke. 

This work is important as there is currently no ""cure"" for dementia, only a handful of medications that help with symptoms for a limited amount of time. By understanding more about the different clinical pathways of dementia patients we aim to identify opportunities to help improve their care by meeting the specific needs of these patients. Findings will also help inform allocation of NHS resources and could improve design of clinical trials to find new medications.","The detailed post-diagnosis experience of people with dementia, their interaction with the healthcare system, co-morbidity profile and treatment pathway remain largely unknown. Dementia is widely acknowledged to be heterogeneous disease; however it remains unknown how progression varies between and within sub-types (e.g. Alzheimer's, vascular dementia and rare dementias such as frontotemporal dementia or Lewy body dementia) and how it is influenced by the co-existence of other comorbidities common in older people (e.g. type-2 diabetes, stroke etc.). 

In this study we will use electronic health records to track the progression pathway of a large cohort of individuals diagnosed with dementia (N~240,000) using previously validated algorithms for identifying sub-groups of dementia patients in CPRD/HES data. Linkage of primary and secondary care records with cancer and mortality registries will facilitate a detailed description of the post-diagnosis experience of patients and interaction with the healthcare system; their symptoms and complications, prescriptions/ medications received, reasons for hospitalisations, treatments, timing and causes of death.

A better understanding of heterogeneity in dementia progression will yield important information to inform guidelines for treatment and management of dementia patients, improve resource allocation and inform the design of clinical trials by helping to optimise selection of patients with specific profiles.","Analyses will be restricted to the most common causes of death, hospitalization and consultation in primary care that occur within the NHS.

i) Mortality

ii) Non-fatal disease outcomes from secondary care
iii) Non-fatal disease outcomes from primary care

This study will develop new mathematical predictive models for selection of people for LDCT screening based on primary care data and compare these with existing models and recommendations. If better models are developed, the identification of individuals who will benefit most from screening, and of those unlikely to benefit, will improve, increasing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the programs likely to be approved in the UK and Europe soon. This approach maximises benefit by using electronic primary care datasets available in the UK, but it is likely that the principles will be transferrable to other countries where electronic healthcare data are available. In particular, the value of adding information on symptoms will be clarified and could lead to improved selection models that can be used in other countries. The ultimate aim will be to develop a model that can be used to create a primary care-based tool embedded in primary care systems that accurately selects patients eligible for CT screening for lung cancer, and provides an opportunity for primary care based invitation.","Objectives:
The overall aim of this project is to determine if primary care data can be used to develop improved risk prediction models for selecting individuals for low dose CT screening for lung cancer? Specific research objectives are:
1.	To develop a series of mathematical models using data from patients one, two and three years prior to lung cancer diagnosis. 
2.	To examine for differences between models, including analysis of variation when stratifying lung cancer into early and late stage, pathological subtype and by route to diagnosis. 
3.	To compare the predictive performance in the external validation datasets and the eligibility rates between the new model(s), the PLCOM2012 and the LLPv2 models over a range of risk thresholds.
4.	To assess the cost effectiveness of the models at varying risk thresholds. 
Methods and data analysis:
a.	A case-control cohort will be identified using all cases of lung cancer linked to data from NCRAS in CPRD and 10 matched controls.
b.	Patient demographic features, all symptoms, diagnoses, investigations and drug prescriptions will be identified and used to produce a risk prediction model. This will involve both traditional statistical techniques and a range of machine learning methods.
c.	This model will be externally validated and cost effectiveness analysis will be performed using microsimulation modelling.","Primary:
Can primary care data be used to develop improved risk prediction models for selecting individuals for low dose CT screening for lung cancer?

Secondary:
How do these models compare with existing models and currently recommended criteria for screening in terms of sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and cost effectiveness?

What proportion of patients diagnosed with lung cancer would have been eligible for screening based on data one or more years prior to their diagnosis?
What is the cost effectiveness of selecting individuals for screening based on the application of these models?","Professor David Baldwin - Chief Investigator - Nottingham University Hospitals

Platelets are involved in blood clotting. The normal range is 150 - 400 x 109/l, and a platelet count of over 400 x 109/l is known as thrombocytosis. Thrombocytosis was recently found to indicate increased risk of cancer: our previous CPRD-based study found that 11.6% of men and 6.2% of women were diagnosed with cancer within one year of having a blood test showing thrombocytosis. 

UK guidance for diagnosing cancer in primary care advises GPs to refer patients for further investigation for suspected cancer if their symptoms suggest a 3% or greater risk of cancer. The risk of cancer far exceeds 3% for patients with thrombocytosis, suggesting that those with a platelet count at the upper end of the normal range may also be at increased risk. 

The present study aims to: 
1.	Investigate the risk of cancer in patients with a high-normal platelet count.  
2.	Explore which cancers patients with high-normal counts are most at risk of, and the cancer staging at diagnosis.
3.	Determine the platelet count at which patients exceed a 3% risk of cancer
We will do this by examining electronic medical records of patients with a platelet count in the normal range, and cancer registry records.","Thrombocytosis is a newly discovered risk marker of cancer. A recent study found that the one year cancer incidence was 11.6% (95% CI 11.0 - 12.3) in male patients with thrombocytosis and 6.2% (95% CI 5.9 - 6.5) in female patients with thrombocytosis.(1) The incidence of cancer exceeded 3% even at the lowest part of the abnormal range (platelet count of 400-424). These figures far exceed the 3% threshold set by NICE for  rapid investigation of suspected cancer.(2) These points suggest that some patients with a platelet count in the upper end of the normal range may have an underlying malignancy associated with their higher platelet count.

The comparison group will enable us to account for any artefactual effect of having had a blood test. The analysis will be stratified by age and gender, as both of these are associated with developing cancer. Platelet count will also be examined as a continuous variable.

PURPOSE: 1.To estimate the risk of cardio-vascular events in patients diagnosed with osteoporosis/fracture, and in users of anti-osteoporosis medication; 2.To determine patient characteristics associated with high cardio-vascular risk; AND 3.To test whether existing models can predict cardio-vascular events in these patients. 

DESIGN/METHODS: We will determine people with a diagnosis of osteoporosis/fracture, and users of anti-osteoporosis medication, and follow them to see if they develop cardio-vascular events. We will fit mathematical equations to identify patient characteristics (age, sex, obesity, etc) associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Finally, we will assess whether existing prediction tools are useful to calculate risk in these patients.

POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE: We will inform on the risk of cardio-vascular events in this particular group of patients, and determine key patient characteristics associated with cardio-vascular risk in this population. This research will inform patients and clinicians to target and treat patients at high cardio-vascular risk.","OBJECTIVES
1.	To estimate incidence rates of cardio-vascular outcomes and mortality amongst osteoporotic, fractured, and users of anti-osteoporosis medication/s.
2.	To test the feasibility and validity of existing cardio-vascular prediction tools 
3.	To fit multivariable models to identify risk factors associated with cardio-vascular outcomes.

METHODS
- Data sources: CPRD GOLD linked to HES-ONS data.
- Participants: three cohorts: 1.newly diagnosed with osteoporosis, 2.fracture, and 3.new users of anti-osteoporosis medication in 2000-2017, with 1+ year of data available. 
- Classic cardio-vascular predictors (age, gender, body mass index, smoking and alcohol, cardiovascular history, type 2 diabetes, thrombo-embolic events, chronic kidney disease, estimated renal function, serum lipids, Charlson co-morbidity, socio-economic status, medications) as well as osteoporosis-specific ones (fracture/s history, diagnosed osteoporosis, steroids, and calciumÂ±D supplements) will be studied.
- Outcomes: (1) myocardial infarction (MI), (2) stroke, (3) CVDeath, (4) Death, (5) MACE1 (first of MI, stroke, CVDeath), (6) MACE2 (first of MI, stroke, death of any cause)
-	Follow-up: from first prescription/diagnosis to the earliest of death, transfer-out, or  (for the drug user cohort) treatment cessation or switching

ANALYSIS: Incidence rates will be estimated. Multivariable Cox models will be used to identify risk factors. Validity measures for existing tools will be calculated including C statistics (discrimination) and observed/expected plots (calibration). All analyses will be stratified by cohort.","- Primary: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke

Scientific evidence should be replicable. When methods are not reported with enough clarity and detail for independent investigators to replicate the evidence, it is difficult to evaluate the validity of the science. The goal is to better understand what information is missing from public reporting that prevents replication of the published results. This project will evaluate how commonly a set of specific design and analysis decisions are reported in publications as well as how lack of clarity in one or more decisions impacts ability to replicate study findings. Our results will inform future policies and guidelines for reporting on healthcare database research. 

This protocol focuses on one sampled study: ""Co-administration of statins with cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors in a UK primary care population"" by Bakhai and colleagues. The Bakhai paper measures the frequency of exposure to statin medications (drugs to lower cholesterol) with medications that potentially interact with them in the general population of the United Kingdom (UK) between 2007 and 2008.

The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics of paediatric patients (ages 6-17) with asthma in England and to provide insight on the clinical care they receive. The study will focus on paediatric patients with asthma as defined by medication use, blood tests (eosinophil levels), and/or frequency of severe asthma exacerbations. Four asthma cohorts reflecting escalating levels of asthma severity and control will be created: 1) Asthma cohort - all paediatric patients treated with an asthma medication; 2) Severe asthma cohort - paediatric patients classified as having severe asthma based on the asthma treatments received; 3) Severe refractory asthma cohort - paediatric patients classified as having severe refractory asthma according to the asthma treatments received and the number of asthma exacerbation episodes experienced; and 4) Severe refractory eosinophilic asthma cohort - paediatric patients classified as having severe refractory eosinophilic asthma based on the asthma treatments received, number of asthma exacerbations and elevated blood eosinophil levels. This study will provide up-to-date information on the characteristics of these paediatric patient cohorts in England and insight on the clinical care they receive.","Asthma-related exacerbations remain a significant burden on the healthcare system and can be described as an acute episode of progressively worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness that results in decreased lung function.1 A severe asthma exacerbation can be defined as: (1) treatment with an initial or increased dose of OCS, (2) an accident and emergency department (A&E) visit, and/or (3) a hospital admission.2 Eosinophilic asthma, recognisable due to its increased levels of blood eosinophils, has been associated with diminished lung function, airway inflammation, uncontrolled symptoms, and higher amounts of exacerbations than non-eosinophilic asthma.3,4 Evidence suggests that the association between increased eosinophils and more numerous exacerbations may be even more apparent in paediatric patients than in adults.5 The current study will describe the background epidemiology and health care utilization in the four paediatric (aged 6-17 years) asthma cohorts in terms of medications, blood eosinophil levels, and/or frequency of severe asthma exacerbations.","- Asthma exacerbations (i.e., asthma-related general practitioner (GP)/hospital visits)

This study will look at patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK. It will compare those whose first language is English with those whose first language is not English or who require an interpreter, according to their GP records. We will presume the second group do not speak the same language as their doctor or nurse. The aim of the study is to determine whether these patients are more likely to have poorly controlled diabetes or have a higher chance of developing more severe diabetes or complications from their illness. The outcomes that we will look at are how well a patient's sugar levels and blood pressure are controlled, the rate that they develop complications from their diabetes at and whether they go on to require insulin to treat their type 2 diabetes (a marker of more severe diabetes). If patients not speaking English as their first language do have differences compared to this those speaking English as a first language this may help target interventions to improve this difference.","The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of not speaking English as a first language on control of, and outcomes from, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in primary care. It could be postulated that not speaking English as a first language will affect many aspects of a patient's care, though no previous population-level studies have investigated this hypothesis in the UK.  
We will use a cohort study design of patients with newly diagnosed T2DM to investigate differences in markers of disease control, time to development of more severe T2DM, as shown by initiation of insulin  and rates of developing complications from diabetes (controlling for baseline disease status). The specific outcomes will be HbA1c, blood pressure, and the development of microvascular (diabetic eye disease, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (peripheral vascular disease, cardiovascular disease or stroke/TIA), and a new insulin requirement. Outcomes will be analysed by linear and logistic regression (for HbA1c and blood pressure) and cox proportional hazards regression (for rates of developing complications and initiation of insulin), controlling for potential confounders. If patients who don't speak English as a first language are shown to have differing outcomes then further research could be aimed at investigating the cause, and targeting interventions to address, this difference.",#NAME?,"Dr Florence Wedmore - Chief Investigator - London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM )

The main complaints of patients with COPD are breathing difficulty, cough, and wheezing, and COPD patients often have periods where their symptoms worsen. The Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy categorizes COPD patients into four disease severity groups (GOLD Groups A-D) based on the patients' breathlessness and worsening of symptoms (called exacerbations). In addition, this strategy document proposes treatment choices suitable for each of these four patient groups.  The goals of COPD treatment are to reduce symptoms, reduce the periods of exacerbations, and improve health status. Despite these recommendations, patients do not always receive the recommended treatment or their treatment is not appropriately changed when their symptoms worsen.  This study will evaluate the number and characteristics of patients on treatment for their COPD, and describe their symptoms and how often they seek medical care while on treatment.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous group of disorders including chronic bronchitis and emphysema that is characterised by airflow obstruction, that is both progressive and largely irreversible.  Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy document proposes suitable first and secondary choice pharmacologic therapies depending on disease severity (GOLD 2017). Despite these evidence-based guidelines, observational studies have shown that routine practice of prescribing treatment for COPD is not always aligned with these recommendations.  In addition, some patients who continue to have worsening of symptoms and exacerbations are not offered a step-up or change in long-acting bronchodilator (LABD) therapy. It is therefore important to understand whether there are patient and disease factors that contribute to the pattern of prescribing. In addition, in order to improve effectiveness of health-care delivery and improve patients' lives, it is vital to understand which patients are reporting poor disease control, their characteristics and outcomes. The current study aims to characterise COPD patients who initiate therapy with LABD maintenance medication and how long they persist with the specific therapy.

Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone and affects around 1 in 200 pregnancies. Untreated hyperthyroidism in pregnancy can result in unwanted outcomes such as miscarriage or being born too early. Effective treatment is therefore vital. However, there are concerns around how well hyperthyroidism is managed in pregnancy and the safety of antithyroid drugs (carbimazole and propylthiouracil). Current guidelines recommend using both drugs at different stages of pregnancy: propylthiouracil in the first three months, to avoid possible harm to the developing child, then switching to carbimazole to avoid possible propylthiouracil-related liver damage. An alternative approach is to permanently treat hyperthyroidism before pregnancy by removing the thyroid gland or using radioiodine. However, we do not know which approach leads to better thyroid control during pregnancy, or how well drug treatment guidelines are being followed. This study will first describe how many UK pregnant women with hyperthyroidism receive each treatment, then examine the impact of treatment on thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy. Identifying which treatment is most effective, and any shortcomings in management, will inform guidelines for better management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.","Hyperthyroidism is common in women of childbearing age and is associated with adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes; optimal treatment is therefore vital. However, there are concerns surrounding the adequacy of its management in pregnancy and the safety of the two main antithyroid drugs (carbimazole and propylthiouracil). Current guidelines recommend a combination approach: propylthiouracil in the first trimester, to avoid potential teratogenicity with carbimazole, then changing to carbimazole to avoid potential propylthiouracil-induced liver damage. Definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism (with radioiodine or thyroidectomy) before pregnancy is also recommended as an alternative to antithyroid drug treatment. However, data on guideline adherence and adequacy of thyroid control in pregnant women with hyperthyroidism in the UK are lacking. We will undertake a descriptive analysis of trends in UK management of hyperthyroidism before and during pregnancy since 2001. Using a cohort design and multivariable logistic regression we will then assess whether definitive treatment before pregnancy results in better thyroid status during pregnancy (defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels within UK reference ranges).

These symptoms come and go and can last up from days to months at a time. It mostly affects women between the age of 20 and 30, and in the United Kingdom is estimated to affect between 10 and 20% people. People with IBS have different symptoms, some patients mainly experience diarrhoea (IBS-D), some constipation (IBS-C) and other patients alternate between the two (IBS-M). Previous IBS treatments include lifestyle and diet improvements and medications, such as laxatives, which treat IBS-related symptoms. 

Linaclotide was the first medication to be approved in the European Union for moderate to severe IBS-C. 

This study aims to look at the types of people that are prescribed linaclotide. In particular, groups of patients who use linaclotide and have not been studied previously are of interest, including the elderly, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and patients with other conditions or medications. To provide more information on this medication, the length of time that patients use linaclotide will also be studied.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, relapsing gastrointestinal condition characterised by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. Prevalence estimations vary with the diagnostic criteria used, and in the United Kingdom (UK) were estimated between 9.5% and 22%. IBS can be classified according to Rome III criteria on the basis of the stool's characteristics: IBS predominantly with diarrhoea (IBS-D); IBS predominantly with constipation (IBS-C); and IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M), with approximately one third of IBS patients having each type.

The commercialisation of linaclotide (Constella), a guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist with visceral analgesic and secretory activities, was approved as the first medicine authorised for the symptomatic treatment of moderate-to-severe IBS-C in adults in the European Union (EU).

This study plans to describe the characteristics of patients newly prescribed linaclotide, especially in certain population subgroups for which the use of linaclotide was not sufficiently documented in the clinical programme (including the elderly, males, pregnant or breast-feeding women, and patients with specific comorbidities or taking other medications), and in groups with potential off-label use and patients with potential for abuse/excessive use.

Given an apparent relationship between paracetamol and subsequent adverse health events, one question is whether paracetamol causes these conditions or whether it reflects the characteristics of patients before getting the drug. An important possible reason for the latter pattern occurs when patients are either much more or much less likely to be prescribed certain medications because of a pre-existing health condition.  An existing health condition may cause physicians not to prescribe a medication because of side effects associated with the condition.  People with a stomach ulcer might not be prescribed ibuprofen because it can cause stomach bleeding and they are already at risk.  Instead, they would get paracetamol for mild pain and would likely continue treatment for their ulcer.  Then the use of paracetamol would appear related to subsequent stomach ulcer, too. The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between paracetamol versus ibuprofen and serious health events after adjusting for patient characteristics before getting the drug.","In a prior study, we observed evidence of channeling bias in paracetamol versus ibuprofen prescription.  We developed an adjustment for channeling bias using outcomes known not to be causally associated with adverse outcomes of either medicine.  We could do this since the exposure and outcome should not be associated.  For this study we use the new method to assess whether adverse outcomes in the published literature are associated with paracetamol versus ibuprofen. 

In users first prescribed paracetamol alone or ibuprofen alone, we will use large scale propensity score matching to obtain relative risks of interest (myocardial infarction, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding or renal disease) after paracetamol versus ibuprofen prescription. Negative controls will be used to assess potential bias and to calibrate p-values.  Positive controls will used for confidence bound estimates.

Two propensity score models will be used.  One based on models typical in the literature using hand-picked covariates.  The other a model including all possible (1,000 +) covariates in the database.  One-to-one matching in on-treatment Cox models of for the outcomes of interest and negative controls will be implemented.

It is very common, affecting one in two older women and one in every 3-4 older men. Its main consequences are bone fractures due to minimal force; with the most devastating being hip fractures. People who suffer hip fractures rarely return to normal daily life, and almost one in five will die within one-year of the fracture. The risk of death is also increased following fractures of other major (more central) bones.  

The most common medications for osteoporosis are oral bisphosphonates. These medications reduce fracture risk by increasing bone density, and may lower the risk of death following a fracture. Moreover, studies have identified that not all patients who have a fracture receive these medications. This may be a missed opportunity as it is expected that patients receiving medications will have better outcomes (lower death rates as well as fewer fractures) compared to those not treated.

The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the use of oral bisphosphonate medications following a major osteoporotic fracture reduces mortality (death) risk.","Objectives: To examine the association of oral bisphosphonate treatment on all-cause mortality after any hip and other major osteoporotic fractures.

Exposure: The primary drug exposure will be the initiation of oral bisphosphonate (alendronate or risedronate vs. etidronate or no) medications. Patient exposure time will be classified time dependently following fracture (index) date.

Primary outcome: All-cause mortality.


Statistical analyses: Cox Proportional Hazard (SAS PHREG procedure) to assess the risk of all-cause mortality associated with the current use of oral bisphosphonate medications following first hip, or non-hip major osteoporotic fracture will be conducted. Never use will be the comparator groups in all analyses, and separate models will be run based on fracture site. All primary analyses will be further stratified by gender.

As well as gaining an overall picture, we will also focus on particular conditions that show rapid deterioration and are commonly missed by the GP (e.g. sepsis).  
This study will contribute to development of real time monitoring, flagging patient deterioration or delays in care. Such information will help clinicians and managers, resulting in fewer patients experiencing harm throughout their patient journeys.","Research suggests that one main cause of safety incidents in primary care is the general practitioner's (GP) failure to recognise signs of a patient's clinical deterioration. Our objective is to investigate healthcare contacts in deteriorating patients and determine the risk factors associated with GPs not referring deteriorating patients for secondary care compared with those patients who are referred. 
We will obtain data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked with Hospital Episode Statistics data on patients who had an emergency hospital admission (their health has deteriorated) between 2014 and 2017. Using individual patient's electronic health records, we will interrogate health contacts of deteriorating patients (we hypothesise this is within 3 days prior to emergency admission), to determine recorded factors such as behaviour (contact at GP or A&E), symptoms, referrals or comorbidities. We will use logistic regression to determine factors associated with a potentially missed deterioration (a GP contact which does not result in referral to hospital). We will investigate all conditions and then focus on specific conditions that are reported as commonly missed in primary care (e.g. sepsis). Our study will contribute to future risk prediction modelling and the development of potential indicators of clinical deterioration within the primary care setting.","Primary

When use of metformin does not result in enough improvement or is not tolerated, another medicine is added to  metformin or patients switch to another medicine (a second-line medicine). In the last years several new second-line medicines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have become available. As result, general practitioners (GPs) have the option to choose the best second-line medicine for an individual patient. This is also recommended by the new type 2 diabetes guideline for doctors in the UK, the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guideline. NICE is an organisation, part of the Department of Health in the UK, that publishes guidelines for health care professionals and patients to help them make decisions about treatment and health care. However, it is not known if implementation of the new guideline resulted in more individual prescribing of second-line medicines and which (patient related) factors influence the prescribing of GPs. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify factors associated with prescribing of different second-line medicines in patients with type 2 diabetes before and after implementation of the new NICE guideline.","This study's primary objective is to identify determinants associated with prescribing of different second-line therapies in patients with T2DM before and after implementation of the new NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guideline. All new users of metformin only and aged 18+ will be followed until they receive a prescription for a glucose-lowering agent other than metformin. We will investigate patient and treatment related determinants, geographic variations and socio-economic related factors. Our secondary objectives are: 1) to investigate if the prescription of a second-line oral glucose lowering agent was an addition or switch of therapy; 2) time to treatment change. Mean time to change in treatment will be estimated per drug class by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with change in treatment as the outcome event. Determinants of treatment change will be estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression. Results will be presented separately for patients with a treatment modification before and after the introduction of the new NICE guideline (December 2015).","Second-line antidiabetic prescribing before and after implementation of the new NICE guideline

A cohort study in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD),"In the United Kingdom (UK) 13 out of 100 patients suffer from high blood pressure. It is an important risk factor for diseases involving the heart or the blood vessels, for diseases involving the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral blood circulation, and for early death. High blood pressure can be treated with one or more drugs from these groups: Beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretic. Each group have different working mechanisms, and because of this they have different benefits and side effects.

Our study will compare the benefit on heart and brain diseases, and on mortality of the Beta-blocker group against each of the four other groups, in patient recently diagnosed and starting for the first time a treatment for high blood pressure.

Moreover, our study will give information about patients treated during several years, which is of importance as high blood pressure is a chronic disease. In addition, using data from the primary health care system in the UK will help understand the benefits of these drugs in day to day clinical practice.","Primary objective is to compare the all-cause mortality in newly hypertensive patients initiating a Beta-blocker in monotherapy, compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) monotherapy, compared to angiotensin II receptor blockers monotherapy, compared to calcium channel blockers (CCB) monotherapy, compared to diuretic monotherapy. Secondary outcomes are cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia), cerebrovascular events (stroke) and discontinuation of index treatment.

Newly hypertensive patients initiating a monotherapy with an antihypertensive drug between 2000 and 2017 will be allocated to one of the cohort: Beta-blocker, ACE-I, ARB, CCB, or diuretic. Only patients with a diagnosis of hypertension for the first time ever within the 6 months before the first antihypertensive prescription date (index date) will be included. Patients will be followed until: addition of another antihypertensive drug, discontinuation of the index antihypertensive class, occurrence of an outcome of interest (depending on the analysis: death, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, treatment discontinuation), patient death, last data collection date in the CRPD, or end of study period, which ever came first.

Differences in all-cause mortality between cohorts will be assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, and differences in the secondary outcomes using Cox proportional hazards models and Fine and Gray's proportional subdistribution hazards models.","All-cause mortality (Primary outcome)

Observational studies (researchers only watch what happens to patients who take or do not take drugs without interference) using electronic health records of patients can be used to examine this issue. The aim of this study is to assess whether the results of a type of clinical trials called ""non-inferiority trials"" can be reproduced in an observational study using a group of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who resemble, in terms of medical background and other health factors, those who were included in the original trial. We will also test whether the results were also maintained in a broader group that includes AF patients who did not exactly resemble those in the trial. These AF patients are taking either rivaroxaban or warfarin (both drugs are prescribed to prevent blood clots in the brain or the body. In the original trial, rivaroxaban was found to be not unacceptably worse than warfarin, but the use of rivaroxaban was a lot easier compared to warfarin.","Objectives: To assess the generalizability of the results of clinical trials in real-life settings with further investigation of the application of non-inferiority analysis in observational studies. 

Methods: the design of the ROCKET AF non-inferiority trial (rivaroxaban vs. warfarin) will be replicated, apart from randomization, in a retrospective cohort study using the CPRD. Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who started rivaroxaban or warfarin will be included in the period from 2008 to 2017. The primary aim is to assess whether non-inferiority can be demonstrated for rivaroxaban vs. warfarin in terms of the composite endpoint of stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) or systemic embolism, and whether these results extend to those AF patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria of the trial). 

Data analysis: We will perform an analysis that replicates the primary analysis of the ROCKET-AF trial: a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis will be used to estimate the effect of rivaroxaban vs. warfarin, while adjusting for many possible confounders (including time-varying confounders). Non-inferiority will be tested using the same margin as used in the ROCKET-AF trial (HR 1.46).",#NAME?,"Professor Olaf Klungel - Chief Investigator - Utrecht University

However, there are limited data available on how the dose of metformin is modified in the real world and the distribution of dose among patients on metformin therapy.

A Retrospective Observational Study Using UK Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data.","Anticholinergic medications are the mainstay of treatment for individuals diagnosed with an overactive bladder (OAB). Patients may also be prescribed anticholinergics for a number of other conditions such as asthma and depression. Excessive use of anticholinergics can cause a number of undesirable side effects, especially in older people; the most notable of these is mental decline. Mental decline may lead to increased interactions with healthcare providers, which in turn increases costs to the healthcare system. This study seeks to understand whether increased use of anticholinergics also increases the number of visits the older OAB population make to their GP, specialists, and hospital and quantify the costs associated with this.","Objective: To determine the association between cumulative anticholinergic burden, calculated using the anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) scale, and healthcare resource utilization (HRU) in older individuals with OAB (> 65 years).

The mean total daily ACB score over the three-year pre-index period will be calculated and its association to HRU (GP visits, visits to specialists (psychiatrists/memory clinics, neurologists, and geriatrics), and hospitalisations) over the two-year post-index period determined through use of generalised linear models (GLM). 

Analysis: Aggregated summary statistics will be provided on patient baseline characteristics. We will compare characteristics amongst ACB groups using the chi-square test, two-sample t-test or ANOVA, and mann-whitney or kruskal-wallis test respectively.

These conditions result in substantial burden for patients and their families and in high need for health care. We are considering three high-need patient personas: 
- an older person with advancing illness
- a frail older person
- a person with major complex chronic conditions
 
The way these high-need patients are managed within the health system varies across countries. This international study will describe what kind of health care these patients use and the costs and quality of that care. Information from England will be compared with information from another 10 countries. Taking account of differences in the cost of living, analysis will highlight countries which have particularly high or low total health care costs, or high or low costs in certain parts of the health system (e.g. costs arising from patients being admitted to hospital, or from medications they are prescribed). It will also highlight countries which have particularly high quality of care. This will help policymakers target aspects of health care that can be changed and that either make up a large burden of cost or make an important difference to the quality of care that these patients receive.","Objectives: Greater understanding of the health care provided for high-need patients offers an opportunity to improve outcomes, value and health. We focus on three high-need patient personas (an older person with dementia, an older person hospitalised for hip fracture, and someone hospitalised with heart failure who has co-morbidity). This international comparative study will: harmonise the operationalisation of these patient personas using data from 11 countries; compare total health care spending (using available data on direct costs to the NHS) and care quality; and compare differences in the specific patterns of health care utilisation (e.g. emergency admission versus in-patient care versus community prescribing). It builds on project reference ISAC 17_150R which compared high-cost patients across countries.
Methods: A cross-sectional study of anonymised CPRD patients registered in 2012-2016 with i) prevalent dementia and aged 65-90, ii) hospital admission for hip fracture and aged 65-90, iii) hospital admission for heart failure plus prevalent diabetes or COPD.  Data on costs (including inpatient and outpatient care, emergency admissions, and prescribed medications), utilisation and care quality indicators (including continuity of care, appointment length) over a 12-month period will be derived from CPRD and linked Hospital Episode Statistics and ONS mortality records.

Various types of antibiotics have been associated with different risks of epileptic seizures. Generally, the risk of epileptic seizure seems to be highest when high doses of antibiotics are used (for example in hospital), or when patients have impaired kidney function, brain disorders, fever, brain infections, or infections in which bacteria are distributed throughout the body. However, it is not clear whether antibiotics are associated with an increased risk of epileptic seizures when taken at usual outpatient (prescribed by the general practitioner) doses. The goal of this study is to quantify the risk of new-onset epileptic seizures in children and adult patients who are newly prescribed oral (taken by mouth) antibiotics by a general practitioner.

It is serious and common. It affects a growing number of people of all ages, but can be difficult to diagnose and manage, particularly in general practice. Identifying those patients who are at highest risk of emergency hospitalisation and death would help doctors and patients make better decisions around where and how rigorously their HF is managed - it would help patients to understand where they are and what they and their family need to do and how this translates into their self-care strategy. However, this ""risk prediction"" is hard to do well. Existing risk prediction models have various limitations that prevent their widespread use. In particular, they have been developed on patients taking part in clinical trials, who are not typical of HF patients treated in the community.

Around 1-2% of the NHS budget is spent on treatment, with 60-70% of the costs related to hospitalisation alone. Though drug therapy has been shown to decrease illness and death, many HF patients will continue to experience poor health.

Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) such as Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT), Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) and Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD) have become increasingly important treatments for patients with moderate to severe HF. Implanted within the body, some devices are able to detect abnormal heart rhythms and correct them. Much research on the benefits of CIED treatment has, however, been derived from USA studies/clinical trials. Within the UK, little is known about its use in non-trial ('real world') populations. 

Our study will investigate the: 1) CIED use for HF patients in England; 2) potential economic impact (costs and/or savings) associated with the devices; 3) adverse outcomes associated with the device implantation and/or hospital stay. Also, comparisons will be made with similar HF patients who do not have a CIED. The study results can support formal economic evaluations (including potential uptake) of such devices within the UK.","The study comprises retrospective cohort analyses examining healthcare utilisation and service outcomes for heart failure (HF) patients with or without a Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device, CIED, in England, diagnosed or with a device implanted between April 2010 and March 2012. For each patient group (those with CRT, ICD, LVAD or none), each kind of NHS contact (primary/secondary care) will be compared, with patient contacts summarised for 5 years after device implantation or first HF admission (diagnosis date will be used instead for HF patients without CIED). Standard national NHS reference costs for the relevant year will be applied for each contact. 

Analyses will begin with descriptive comparisons of HF patient groups by their socio-demographic factors, LOS and co-morbidities followed by logistic regression. We will attempt to infer, to extent possible, causal effects and other associations between device implantation and subsequent resource usage by use of propensity score matching on socio-demographic factors and co-morbidities. Using the matched groups, logistic regression models will be constructed with device (CRT, defibrillator, LVAD or none) as the treatment of interest; the outcome will be total cost during the five years following device implantation or diagnosis dichotomised into highest quintile vs lowest four quintiles.","- Hospital use (ED visits, admissions, OPD attendances)

However, over 80% of individuals are not identified, leading to many avoidable heart attacks and early deaths. Use of cholesterol lowering medication can prevent over half of these premature heart attacks.

The research aims to determine the long term cardiovascular disease outcome, associated health care costs and quality of life experienced by individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia. The information will then be used in economic models developed to determine which approach for identifying and managing the condition provides the most value for money for the UK National Health Service.  

One major area of uncertainty is the frequency and timing of serious cardiovascular events in FH patients.
Economic models to date have relied on general population data on cardiovascular events which have been applied to patients with FH. To address this limitation, we therefore plan to use FH patients diagnosed in CPRD and link this to Hospital Episode Statistic (HES). The outputs of this analysis are parameters for the economic models which would more accurately quantify the long term costs and health outcomes experienced by patients with FH.","Background: Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common inherited cause of raised cholesterol. To support development of cost-effectiveness models, information regarding the long-term consequences and costs of FH is required.

Aims: To build a robust multi-state model predicting the long-term rates of cardiovascular events and cost utilisation amongst FH patients diagnosed in primary care.

Participants: 3,182 CPRD patients diagnosed with FH from the 1 Jan 1999 with known eligibility for linkage to Hospital Episodes Statistics.

Methods:  Data will be analysed using a form of survival analysis called multi-state modelling. Parametric survival models will be used to facilitate extrapolation of event rates over the full lifetime of the FH patients. Estimates of event rates will be conditioned upon patients' baseline demographic, clinical characteristics and lipid lowering treatment, using multivariate parametric survival regressions. Through the development of an economic model, we will estimate the costs falling on the NHS budget associated with the cardiovascular and fatal events.
Outputs: Estimated parameters from the survival analysis will inform the economic model to produce estimates of: the life expectancy of FH patients, expected time to cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular events, expected cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality, the costs of cardiovascular and non-fatal events and the total costs and consequences for FH patients.",#NAME?,"Dr Stephen Weng - Chief Investigator - University of Nottingham

Of these about one-third will result in death. The risk of MI increases with age but other factors such as smoking, being overweight, high cholesterol and high blood pressure are also important. In addition, people who have survived an MI are at increased risk of having a second MI or other events such as a stroke.  As such, people who have a MI are targeted with different treatments to reduce cholesterol and blood pressure. Recent data from a clinical trial has suggested that a drug called canakinumab may also reduce the risk of a second MI, stroke event or CV death. In this study, we wish to use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to find a population with MI and to see how subsequent MIs or strokes increase their risk of death. This study will be important in helping to identify the size of the population that could potentially benefit from treatment with canakinumab.","Incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) is predictive of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE).

We know that patients with COPD often have other medical problems (multimorbidity) affecting health, life expectancy and risk of hospital admission. However, we don't know if multimorbidity is as important as the severity of COPD itself in predicting future health and need for treatment. Using health data about patients with COPD that is already recorded by GP practices across the UK we will find out how many patients recorded as having COPD actually have advanced, more severe disease. We will learn how best to predict their future needs for healthcare and also to understand how multimorbidity affects the health of people with COPD. It will also help local health organisations plan care for people with COPD, local GPs look after patients with COPD and help us understand which patients should be referred to a specialist.","Using R and SPSS, data will be cleaned and explored with expert consideration given to reasons, extent and remedies for missing data.

A retrospective, observational study using the UK CPRD","Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) is a term used to describe a number of urinary symptoms in men and women. Under the umbrella of LUTS, Overactive Bladder (OAB) is a common condition in both men and women causing urinary urgency (sometimes with leakage of urine), increased use of the toilet during the day, and sometimes during the night. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia/LUTS (BPH/LUTS) is a common cause of LUTS in men and occurs when the prostate becomes enlarged, and interferes with the normal passage of urine. Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) is one of the most common causes of accidental urine leakage in women, often during activities such as laughing, running and lifting.

Combinations of medicines that work in different ways have been used to produce better outcomes with patients in areas of healthcare such as managing blood-pressure and diabetes. In LUTS too, several clinical studies have shown this to be the case. This study aims to complement these clinical studies by exploring which LUTS medicines are used alone and in combination with others in real-life practice, how long patients take their medicines for, and how much resource use such as GP appointments and hospital admissions is associated with different treatments.","Background and Objectives: Drug combinations have successfully been used in many areas of healthcare to achieve better outcomes than by monotherapy alone. There is currently a lack of understanding of the Real-World landscape of combination therapy employed in the area of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in UK clinical practice.

The methods section in publications describe how research is conducted.  This protocol is part of the REPEAT Initiative, a project that is attempting to replicate a sample of published research studies using information provided in the publications. REPEAT is focused on studies using observational healthcare data from electronic health records or administrative claims to generate scientific evidence. The goal is to better understand what information is missing in publications that prevents replication of the published results. This project will evaluate how commonly important decisions in research process design are not clearly reported as well as how lack of impacts ability to replicate study findings. Our results will inform future policies and guidelines for reporting on healthcare database research. 

This protocol focuses on one sampled study: ""Metformin and the incidence of viral associated cancers in patients with type 2 diabetes"" by Hicks and colleagues. This paper compares the risk of cancers associated with viruses in patients with type 2 diabetes related to use of metformin (a drug to treat diabetes)  for a diabetic population in the United Kingdom (UK) between 1988 and 2016. We will replicate this study based on methods reported in the publication.","This objective of this protocol is to replicate the study: ""Metformin and the incidence of viral associated cancers in patients with type 2 diabetes"" by Hicks et al based on methods reported in the publication and appendices. We have created a checklist of specific study implementation parameters based on a comprehensive catalogue outlined in a consensus paper endorsed by the International Society of Pharmacoepidemiology and the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes research. We will start by reviewing the paper to identify which parameters from the catalogue are reported. We will then replicate the study population and analyses based on the study design and implementation parameters extracted during review. 

The Hicks paper compares the risk of viral associated cancers for patients with type 2 diabetes exposed to metformin between 1988 and 2016. We will focus on replicating the adjusted hazards ratio comparing the risk of viral associated cancers for time varying exposure to metformin. Patients were followed from new initiation of a non-insulin anti-diabetic agent until a first ever diagnosis of viral associated cancers, death from any cause, end of registration with the practice, or end of the study period (March 31, 2016), whichever occurred first. Risk of viral associated cancers was evaluated using a a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model.","Primary diagnosis of viral associated cancer defined as a composite outcome (including hepatocellular carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, T-cell leukaemia, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, B and T cell lymphoma, cervical cancer, anal cancer, penile cancer, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer).","Jeremy Rassen - Chief Investigator - Aetion, Inc

Ibuprofen is used to ease mild to moderate pain, control fever and ease pain and inflammation in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. 
A sub study of a clinical trial had shown that high dose ibuprofen (1800mg/day or more) was related to a substantial increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and a higher number of new cases of high blood pressure compared to celecoxib, another NSAID, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis who had pre-existing or were at high risk for cardiovascular disease. 
Data on the prescribing of high dose ibuprofen in the UK will be helpful in assessing the frequency of use at this dose. It will be useful to see how many patients with pre-existing high blood pressure are being prescribed high dose ibuprofen given that there is a warning to avoid ibuprofen for dose at 2400mg in these patients. This study will help to determine whether there would be a public health benefit in updating the product information of ibuprofen for use at 1800mg/2400mg per day.","The main objective of the study is to evaluate the prescribing of high dose ibuprofen (1800mg or more) using CPRD GOLD.

A prognostic cohort study using data from The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD),"The term polypharmacy describes the practice of prescribing multiple medicines for one individual. This practice has been increasing over the past decade and is most likely attributable to a growing ageing population who have an increased number of long-term conditions. There is some evidence to suggest that polypharmacy may be beneficial; however, other researchers report that this practice is associated with harmful consequences, including falls, hospitalisations and death. 

Several studies have been conducted to determine whether polypharmacy is associated with certain medications or specific long-term conditions. Findings showed that medications which act on the heart are most commonly prescribed in polypharmacy regimens, in addition to establishing an association between polypharmacy and heart conditions. 

This study will focus on one heart condition, atrial fibrillation (AF). The condition currently affects 1.4 million adults living in England and like polypharmacy, the incidence of AF increases with age. If left untreated or managed inappropriately, AF can cause strokes, heart failure and death. The aim of this study is to determine whether polypharmacy is associated with death or strokes in patients who have been newly diagnosed with AF.","This prognostic cohort study has been designed to determine whether polypharmacy is associated with death or ischemic stroke among individuals who have been newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Only data labelled as 'acceptable' by CPRD will be used in this study. All patients with a recorded diagnosis of AF will be identified. The earliest record of AF will be defined as the index date. Details of prescribed medications, issued within the first three months of the index date, will be obtained for each patient. Using this data, patients will be allocated into one of the following three groups: unexposed at study entry (1-4 different prescribed medicines), exposed to polypharmacy at study entry (5-9 different prescribed medicines) or exposed to hyper-polypharmacy at study entry (>/=10 different prescribed medicines). Patients will be followed until the occurrence of a study outcome (i.e. death or ischemic stroke) or until the end of follow-up (10 years maximum). Comparisons will be made between the incidence of death and ischemic stroke in the exposed, compared to the unexposed groups. All models will be adjusted for known prognostic factors, which will be measured in the two years prior to index date.","-	Incidence of death during follow up period

However, we are still unable to predict risk of fracture in shorter time horizons (e.g. a 1-year or 2-year periods).  Defining patient groups at high short-term (imminent) risk of fracture could be useful for providing stronger/faster-acting treatments to these patients. This has an important impact on decision making of clinicians taking care of these patients.

We therefore aim to define patient groups at potentially high imminent risk of fractures, and to evaluate the current practice of osteoporosis treatment in these patients. For this, we will define several patient groups within the CPRD dataset at the start of year 2015 (based on their characteristics such as recorded diagnosis of osteoporosis or history of specific types of fracture). The rate of fractures and number of patients receiving osteoporosis treatment in the next 2 years (i.e. until end of 2016) will then be calculated and compared between different groups. Safety concerns about cardiovascular problems (like heart attack and stroke) will also be assessed for all these patients.","Patients at short-term (i.e. in 1- or 2-years) high risk of fracture (imminent risk) can be targeted for stronger/faster-acting treatments. Hence, we aim to define several patient populations with imminent fracture risk and to compare 1) incident fracture rates; 2) osteoporosis treatment; 3) cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and stroke) in these populations. We will use CPRD data linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) inpatient data and Office of National Statistics (ONS) mortality data. All female patients aged 50+ on 1/1/2015 and registered in CPRD for a minimum of 1 year will be evaluated and assigned to a 'general cohort'. Several sub-cohorts with imminent fracture risk will be defined based on diagnosis of osteoporosis or the type and number of fractures before 1/1/2015. Patients can be eligible to be included in more than one of these cohorts. Demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities and medications will be recorded for all patients at the baseline (i.e. 1/1/2015). Patients will be followed through linked CPRD-HES-ONS data until 31/12/2016, and rate of incident fractures, number of patients treated for osteoporosis, and rate of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction/stroke/cardiovascular death) in 1- and 2-year follow-up periods will be calculated and presented for different cohorts.","Osteoporotic fractures

There are several drug treatments available to treat COPD, and this project will use the first decision to change or stop treatment as a way of comparing treatment effectiveness and safety. Our first step will be to describe how frequently the different available treatments are prescribed, following a diagnosis of COPD. We will then determine how long people remain on their COPD treatment as initially prescribed and compare this between the different treatments. A decision to change or stop treatment will largely reflect a combination of perceived treatment tolerability and effectiveness, and our comparisons will therefore serve as a way of ranking treatments according to a combination of their risks and benefits, (though we will not be able to distinguish between risks and benefits). This could help patients and prescribers to decide which treatment is likely to be the best one to start with when treating COPD.","This study aims to describe prescribing patterns and compare the time to first treatment change amongst people receiving medication for COPD (using time to treatment change as a proxy for treatment effectiveness and tolerability). We will firstly determine all patients with a valid diagnosis of COPD who start treatment for COPD at the time of, or after this diagnosis. We will then describe the different treatments people are receiving (e.g. long acting beta-agonist (LABA), long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), ICS/LABA combination). Finally, we will use Cox regression to determine any differences in time to treatment change, between these groups, using the group prescribed a LAMA as the baseline group as based on feasibility work we anticipate this will be the largest group. Treatment change will be defined as either the discontinuation of the initial treatment or the addition of a further COPD treatment.

Policies that discourage people from starting to smoke and encourage people to quit smoking are likely to improve public health by reducing the amount of people with COPD. However, which policies to implement is a decision that needs to be supported by research. A Health Impact Assessment is one method to evaluate and measure how a policy intervention can impact behaviour and improve public health. 

As part of the ""Ageing Lungs in European Cohorts"" (ALEC) study, this project will use a Health Impact Assessment approach to assess how price increases in tobacco may reduce the amount of people who smoke, and consequently, the COPD burden over a 40-year timeframe in three European countries (Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom). Information on population demographics and smoking behaviour will be country-specific and obtained from local sources. Information on the current burden of COPD will be obtained from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) records and applied to all three countries, given the large size and coverage of the CPRD resource and the lack of equivalent country-specific data available for use by the applicants.","Using the Health Impact Assessment tool ""DYNAMO-HIA"" and data from Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom, we will quantify the reductions in future COPD prevalence and incidence that would occur over a 40-year time frame if tobacco prices increased by 25% and 50%, compared to a business-as-usual scenario. DYNAMO-HIA uses a Markov-based modelling approach to model age and sex group specific probabilities of staying or moving to a risk factor (smoking) group under certain scenarios, and quantifies how this affects future risk factor (smoking) and disease (COPD) trends. 

Demographic and smoking behaviour information will be country-specific and obtained from local resources. COPD disease data will be obtained from the CPRD and used for all three countries. The CPRD study population will consist of a 1 million person random sample of patients 6 - 95 years-old contained within the CPRD record between 01/01/ 2015 and 31/12/2017. Doctor diagnosed COPD prevalence, incidence, excess mortality and 1-year mortality rates will be calculated and inputted into DYNAMO-HIA alongside demographic and smoking behaviour information.

While the coronavirus primarily causes a respiratory illness, it also has effects on other body parts such the heart, kidneys and blood cells and can therefore present with a wide range of symptoms. The effects of COVID-19 may last significantly longer than the initial infection. People who have had COVID-19 may have an increased risk of developing long-term health conditions such as other respiratory illnesses, heart and circulatory diseases, and blood disorders.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care and management of people with long-term health conditions is also largely unknown. It is likely to be considerable given there is reduced access to healthcare including fewer face-to-face consultations and monitoring of health conditions. The health of people with long-term conditions may have been adversely affected in both the short and longer-term. There may also be unintended effects of having more telephone consultations instead of face-to-face appointments with potential impacts on the rates of prescribing of medications such antidepressants, antibiotics and opioids.

The aim of this research is to assess whether having COVID-19 influences the risk of being diagnosed with certain long-term health conditions. We will also assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of people with long-term health conditions. This may help us to understand the impact of the pandemic on people with long-term conditions, and to help lessen the impact of these effects in ongoing and future surges of infection within the community.","This study comprises three interrelated studies which, overall, aim to assess the direct effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis and management of chronic conditions.

Firstly, we will use a series of retrospective cohort studies to analyse the short-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on risk of developing common chronic diseases including autoimmune diseases, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, gastrointestinal and liver diseases, haematological diseases (including venous thromboembolism), mental health diseases, neurological diseases, and respiratory diseases. These cohort studies will use descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the incidence of each of these chronic diseases, adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics characteristics.

Secondly, for those already diagnosed with these long-term conditions, we will use controlled interrupted time series analysis to assess any change in disease-specific measurements of clinical management, and rates of prescriptions and referrals during 2020 compared with the three years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular reference to March 23rd 2020, when the first lockdown was announced.

Finally, using Cox proportional hazard models we will assess whether the severity of the long-term conditions at baseline predicts the hazard of infection with SARS-CoV-2, and subsequent hospitalisation and mortality. These models will be stratified by sex and we will adjust for sociodemographic characteristics and other risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Study 1: Outcomes for the Retrospective Cohort Analysis include:
Incidence of predefined long-term health conditions (autoimmune diseases, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, gastrointestinal and liver diseases, haematological diseases, mental health diseases, neurological diseases, and respiratory diseases); and hospitalisation related to each specific long-term health condition.

Study 2: Outcomes for Interrupted Time Series include
Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; hospitalisation for SARS-CoV-2 infection; disease-specific measures of clinical management of long-term health conditions including biochemical biomarkers of disease and blood pressure, rate of medication prescription, occurrence of disease-specific clinical reviews, rate of referral to specialist care or service; cause-specific mortality; and all-cause mortality.

While most people with COVID-19 will have only mild symptoms, some people have very severe symptoms that require hospitalisation. Based upon the symptoms of COVID-19, and the experience of survivors of previous similar infectious lung diseases such as SARS, it is possible that survivors of both mild and severe COVID-19 may have a greater burden of long-term health problems. Given that the recorded number of people in the UK who have had or currently have COVID-19 is over 300 000, there is a need to assess the health of people who survive COVID-19 in the UK. Our study will investigate mortality and the burden of health problems in people who: (a) are admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 (i.e. have severe disease) and then survive, and (b) have COVID-19 but are not admitted to hospital (i.e. have milder disease), and then compare each to a group made up of people with no previous record of having COVID-19. We will also look at whether the occurrence of health problems is different based upon a person’s age, ethnicity, sex and any chronic illnesses and/or drug treatment that they had before having COVID-19. As well as helping individual patients and their carers, this information will also help the NHS plan and allocate resources appropriately in order to help people who have survived COVID-19.","There have been over 8 million cases worldwide of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. With a case-fatality of around 1%, the number of people who survive is set to increase substantially as the pandemic progresses. It is currently not known what the short- or long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are on those who survive, but clinical features of the condition and existing evidence from the SARS (SARS-CoV-1) pandemic suggest the potential for a range of debilitating post-viral conditions. As over 300 000 have had or currently have COVID-19 (based upon UK Government Pillar 1 test results) and this figure is likely to rise, there is an urgent need to assess and to quantify short and long-term health for people in the UK who survive COVID-19. This information will assist patients and their carers and will inform NHS health service planning.

Using two study populations - (a) people who have been admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 (i.e. have severe disease) and (b) people who have COVID-19 but are not admitted to hospital (i.e. have milder disease) - we plan to perform a matched cohort study in which the unexposed are people with no record of COVID-19.We will measure frequency of mortality and a range of key respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, mental health and autoimmune outcomes. Analysis will be performed during the 3-month period after index date and at 4 subsequent time points (6 months,1 year, 3 years and 5 years after index date), and at each timepoint we will look at whether effects differ by age, ethnicity, sex, prior chronic illness and prior drug treatment. Each individual will be matched by age, sex, general practice and charlson comorbidiy index to individuals with no record of having COVID-19, and the time-to-first event for each outcome will be compared between groups. We will also use multivariable ordinal logistic and linear regression to analyse the effect of previous COVID-19 on frailty in survivors >=65 years of age.","1.

These include cholesterol, triglycerides and other lipids. The overproduction of cholesterol without an external cause is termed primary hypercholesterolaemia (PH), while the overproduction or defective processing of other lipids is called mixed dyslipidaemia (MD). In PH or MD, these lipids may accumulate, especially in blood vessels. Through the years, the accumulations will eventually produce a blood clot, which can block blood flow. This produces heart attacks, strokes, kidney problems, and even gangrene in the feet, depending on which blood vessel was blocked.

PH and MD are treated with medications that control the level of lipids through different mechanisms. These include statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors (which inhibit a protein called proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), and other medications. Additionally, there are health policies influencing diet and exercise that have been deployed in England.

We wish to determine how the number of patients with PH and MD has changed for the past decade (2009-2018), their patient profile, how those patients are shifted from one treatment to another, how many patients have either achieved control on each treatment, or experienced outcomes related to blood vessel obstruction that PH and MD may cause, and how much health care resource use was expended in caring for PH and MD patients. This study using a linked dataset from primary care and secondary care would be helpful in achieving that objective.","Primary hypercholesterolaemia (PH) and mixed dyslipidaemia (MD) portend a higher risk of cardiovascular events due to the thrombogenic milieu afforded by increased production and dysfunctional metabolism of cholesterol and other lipids. 

The treatment of PH and MD involves administration of various medications, including statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, weight control, and lifestyle modification, based on clinical practice guidelines. However, it is important to understand how these medications and treatments have been implemented in England. Additionally, it would be important to understand the changes in the epidemiology of PH and MD in England, the health outcomes PH and MD patients experience, and how much healthcare resources were expended in the care of patients with PH and MD in primary and secondary care.

In order to answer these questions, we intend to perform a study on the CPRD-HES linked data on patients diagnosed to have PH and MD. Through this, we can establish a trend in the prevalence and incidence of PH and MD, then determine their risk factor profile and demographic characteristics. We would then track patient records forwards to determine receipt of various medications used to treat PH and MD. Finally, we would like to determine the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes in that cohort, as well as the healthcare resource use in inpatient, outpatient, A&E and GP care.

Through our study, we hope to gain a clearer understanding of PH and MD in England, what treatment pathways patients with PH and MD undergo, and what outcomes they experience.","Epidemiologic experience (annual incidence of PH and MD, period prevalence of PH and MD, mean annual prevalence of PH and MD), demographic characteristics and clinical profile (age, sex, blood pressure on inclusion, low density lipoprotein (LDL) level, total cholesterol level, prevalence of co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease, familial hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease), clinical outcomes (incidence of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stable angina, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, cardiovascular events in aggregate), healthcare resource use (inpatient admissions, outpatient appointments, A&E attendances, GP appointments and associated tariffs).","Dr Adrian Paul J.

This works aims to describe the recording of COVID-19 diagnosis and test results across the CPRD primary care data and SGSS test data and assess how well these agree. The groups of patients with a diagnosis or positive test result in the different databases will be described by age, gender, region, ethnicity and an indicator of how deprived the area is that the patient lives in.

Understanding how well the information on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is recorded across different data sources will help researchers in determining how best to use these different datasets to identify COVID-19 positive study populations and for research into COVID-19.","CPRD provide de-identified primary care data for public health research. In light of the COVID-19 global pandemic, linkage to the Public Health England (PHE) Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) SARS-CoV-2 positive virology pillar 1 test data was established. The added value of these data is currently poorly understood. We will establish the agreement of primary care recording around COVID-19 and the linked SGSS SARS-CoV-2 positive test data. This will assess the added value of the SGSS-linkage and contribute to our understanding of how well COVID-19 diagnoses are being recorded in primary care data. This knowledge is crucial to support research into COVID-19 using these data sources, which in turn can inform our understanding of the disease and inform patient care and public health policy.
All patients in CPRD Aurum and CPRD GOLD eligible for linkage to the SGSS SARS-CoV-2 test data and who have at least one day of registration between March 2020 and the end of the SGSS coverage period (currently July 2020) will be included.
We will describe the COVID-19 case status data available via the primary care record, and that available via the linked SGSS data in terms of numbers of events, age, gender, practice region, ethnicity, and patient-level IMD quintile.
Two measures of agreement between the recording of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses in primary care and the SGSS pillar 1 testing data will be estimated. The proportion of patients with a record indicating a COVID-19 diagnosis in the primary care data who also have a positive SARS-CoV-2 test record in SGSS data will be estimated as the first measure.

A recent survey of patients with chronic conditions across Europe and the US reported an impact on medical consultations, treatment intake and psychological wellbeing. For future real-world data studies in neurological disease populations, it is important to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the routine clinical management of different types of neurological diseases. For this purpose, we propose to describe routine clinical management of patients with selected neurological disease (i.e., Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)) during the COVID-19 pandemic peak period to the same time period in previous years (2015-2019). Specifically, we will investigate the number of medical consultations, referrals and prescriptions as well as psychological symptoms. In addition, we will explore how these outcomes relate to the daily COVID-19 case numbers and timing of governmental “lockdown” measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We will use these findings to inform future studies analyzing primary care data in the UK.","The COVID-19 pandemic may have profoundly changed the clinical management of patients with chronic conditions. A recent survey of patients with chronic conditions across Europe and the US (N= 6780) reported that 41% of patients had less medical visits than usual, 46% had postponed or cancelled medical visits or surgeries and 10% had a treatment modification [1].  For future real-world data studies in neurological disease populations, it is important to confirm and quantify the evidence - which was mostly collected in surveys - in real-world data to better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the routine clinical management of different types of neurological diseases. This retrospective cohort study of prevalent and incident patients with selected neurological disorders (i.e., Autism Spectrum Disorder, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s disease) aims at describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care data in England. For this purpose, we compare healthcare resource utilisation during the COVID-19 pandemic peak period in 2020 to the same periods in 2015-2019 using CPRD. Specifically, we quantify the incidence of the selected neurological diseases, proportion and average number of medical consultations, referrals, and prescriptions including antidepressants and anxiolytics. Additionally, we explore the relation of these outcomes to the daily COVID-19 case numbers and the timing of the UK governmental measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 using interrupted time series analysis. The findings contribute to our understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted primary care management in England. This can inform future studies generating real-world evidence based on this real-world data source. Moreover, our results could generate hypotheses on the impact of different COVID-19 policies on routine clinical care.","Separately for each year 2015-2020 in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients: Incidence of respective neurological disease; Number and type of medical consultations; Number of referrals and type of speciality; Number of prescriptions and drug class including antidepressants and anxiolytics","Teresa Karrer - Chief Investigator - F.

We plan to examine how many patients are affected by these potentially hazardous prescriptions using GP records. Similar work has been conducted to examine how common potentially hazardous prescribing is across the general population in primary care, but no work has been conducted specifically for patients with mental health problems or with a focus on medications to treat mental illness. 
In order to detect potentially hazardous prescribing, we will be using prescribing safety indicators. A group of mental health experts have agreed on the definition of the indicators we will use. These indicators describe patterns of prescribing and drug monitoring that should not usually happen in practice because it increases the risk of harm. From the CPRD database, we will count the numbers of all patients who were exposed to a prescription or drug monitoring practice that they usually should not have (because of a diagnosis or prescription they already had). We will also explore the change of these numbers over time and examine the variation in these prescribing patterns between general practices.","The safety of prescribing specifically for patients with mental disorders in primary care has not been investigated in a large sample of the UK population. Therefore, this study aims to assess the safety of prescribing for patients with mental disorders in primary care across the UK in order to find targets for improving prescribing safety and reducing medication-related harm. Mental health related prescribing safety indicators will be used to evaluate the safety of prescribing. These indicators were developed using the Delphi consensus method to detect potentially hazardous prescribing and drug monitoring practice that may place patients with mental illnesses at significant risk of harm. 
This study will be longitudinal to examine the change in the prevalence of different types of mental health related potentially hazardous prescribing and inadequate monitoring indicators between 2009-2019. In addition, a cross-sectional analysis will be conducted for 2019 data to explore the variations between practices and the reliability of each indicator. This study will also examine patient and practice-level characteristics that are associated with potentially hazardous prescribing and inadequate drug monitoring.
Data will be extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD GOLD) for all patients with the potential to trigger an indicator because of age, disease, and/or prescription. The proportion of eligible patients receiving a potentially hazardous prescription will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Variations between practices will be quantified for each indicator and a composite indicator using mixed effects two level logistic regression model and will be estimated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The reliability of each indicator and the composite indicator will be estimated using the Spearman-Brown Prophecy Formula. The associations between the composite and patient or practice characteristics will also be examined using multivariable two-level logistic regression.",Variations between practices in the prevalence of each prescribing safety indicator and composite indicator in 2018; reliability of each mental health related prescribing safety indicators and composite indicator at practice level; patient and practice level characteristics associated with the composite indicator; prevalence of each prescribing safety indicator and composite indicator from 2009-2019.,"Douglas Steinke - Chief Investigator - University of Manchester

1616634485-2669,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=2,MuSculoskeletal paiN durIng the COVID-19 PandEmic: an observational study of UK national primary care electronic health records (the SNIPE Study),"Since the beginning of the covid pandemic, most people who needed healthcare advice about symptoms not related to covid either spoke to their doctor on the telephone or via video-call. Most specialist services were paused to reduce the spread of the virus and to prioritise care for people with covid. GPs could only refer for very urgent or emergency reasons.

Aches and pains can be managed in many ways, including education, physical therapy, exercises and painkilling medication. It is important that GPs recognize aches and pains that might be due to conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. If a GP thinks that a person might have rheumatoid arthritis, it is important that they refer the person to see a specialist very quickly, as the sooner treatment can be started, the better.

We think that over the course of the pandemic, the numbers of people contacting their GP for help with aches and pains will change. Also, as GPs can’t refer to specialists for anything but emergencies, they might be more likely to prescribe stronger painkillers, which can be harmful. In other conditions such as cancer, it has been noticed that the number of people who are found to have a new cancer has fallen during the pandemic. We want to see if this is the same for rheumatoid arthritis.

This is important because we can give clearer advice to the public urging them to seek help for aches and pains that might indicate rheumatoid arthritis, despite the pandemic. We will also be able to give guidance to health care professionals about when to refer to specialists.","The SNIPE study builds on observations from practising clinicians and patients that the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected the care delivered to patients with musculoskeletal disorders in primary care. Patients are being managed remotely with no access to routine specialist services. Instead, they may be prescribed analgesia at increasing strength and thus are at risk of harm. There are also concerns that, as with cancer, reluctance to consult, remote consulting and a hold on routine referral pathways may lead to delayed diagnosis of inflammatory arthropathies (IA) (for example, rheumatoid arthritis and Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis).

The SNIPE study objective is to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the care of adults and children with musculoskeletal disorders. Three hypotheses will be addressed:

1) that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the numbers of patients consulting in primary care with musculoskeletal conditions from any cause;
2) that analgesic prescribing for these patients has changed;
3) that the time to diagnosis of IA has been affected by the pandemic.

The study population includes all primary care users whose electronic records are included in CPRD Aurum. Prevalence and incidence of consultations for all musculoskeletal conditions and associated analgesic prescribing, and time to diagnosis of IA, will be measured throughout the pandemic periods and differences presented; To overcome difficulties defining fluid time periods, Joinpoint regression will be used to identify significant changes in trends. The study will be conducted in two workstreams to enable timely delivery of results to guide swift action in preparation for future pandemic phases. Workstream 1 will investigate the pre-pandemic peroid and the current COVID-19 wave; Workstream 2 will investigate the time period following the current COVID-19 phase. Workstream findings will be developed with stakeholders including public involvement (PI) and disseminated through PI activities, digital platforms and traditional methods.","Hypothesis 1:
Prevalence and incidence of primary care consultations for musculoskeletal disorders per 10,000 persons in the registered population.

Hypothesis 2:
Prevalence and incidence of analgesic prescribing (paracetamol, NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), opioids, amitriptyline, gabapentinoid and duloxetine) per 10,000 registered population and per 10,000 population with an associated musculoskeletal-related consultation.

Hypothesis 3:
Period prevalence of referrals in musculoskeletal consulters, incidence of inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. RA and JIA), time in days between incident musculoskeletal consultation and i) referral and ii) incident RA / JIA diagnosis.

All of these outcomes will be measured before throughout the pandemic period.","Victoria Welsh - Chief Investigator - Keele University

1616634448-2653,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=2,"Comparative effectiveness and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers on the risk of major cardiovascular events, cancer and renal outcomes","High blood pressure affects more than 1 in 4 adults in the UK, increasing the risk of premature death and illness due to its effects on several body organs, including the, heart and kidneys. Despite these risks, control of blood pressure generally remains suboptimal and individuals will require medication (antihypertensives) to lower blood pressure. Most guidelines recommend starting treatment with the antihypertensive drug, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) considered as the alternative antihypertensive therapy if patients are not able to take ACEIs.

Although these two types of antihypertensive medication are often considered equivalent by clinicians, there have been concerns regarding the safety of these medications. In comparative clinical trials, ACEIs were shown to reduce death from any cause and deaths due to heart disease whilst ARBs had no effect on reducing death. There are also reports that ACEIs may increase the risk of specific types of cancer.

We will investigate the relationship between the use of ACEIs and ARBs and serious outcomes, including, heart disease, cancer, renal disease and death.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, with the two medications deemed to be interchangeable when one class is not tolerated. However, debate has been raised regarding whether these drug classes are similarly effective, with indications of different adverse events associated with each class. 

Following a clinical trial in 2004, controversy surrounded the use of ARBs as it appeared to increase the risk of myocardial infarction among people with hypertension. Since then, numerous studies have tried to assess the safety of ACEIs relative to ARBs and have produced inconsistent results for cardiovascular risk and mortality. Similarly, there are conflicting reports from recent studies and meta-analyses on cancer risk associated with both drugs. Both agents have demonstrated renoprotective effects; however it is unclear if these agents offer similar benefits or if one agent is superior.

As ARBs entered the market much later than ACEIs, patient profiles of those in ARB and ACEI trials were very different, with changes in primary and secondary prevention strategies occurring over that period. Therefore, it is of importance to establish and directly compare the safety of these drugs in contemporary, clinical practice with longer-term follow-up.

Data will be obtained from CPRD GOLD and Aurum, with a common protocol applied across the databases for cohort construction and analysis. The study populations will consist of any individual initiating an ACEI or ARB between 01/01/1998-31/05/2018, with follow-up until 30/11/2018. Hazard ratios for the outcomes of interest among patients receiving ACEIs, as compared with those receiving ARBs, will be estimated from Cox regression models and the data from the separate study cohorts will be meta-analysed with the use of random-effects models. All analyses will be replicated in a cohort of people with type 2 diabetes.","Outcome1 - Cardiovascular

We will investigate the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on individuals with the two common lung diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, using electronic health records in three ways. First, we will use epidemiologic approaches to look at “direct” effects, caused directly when people become infected. Second, we will study “indirect” effects, which are not due to infection, but due to changes in the health system or peoples’ behaviours during the pandemic, such as not attending hospitals due to fear of infection. Third, we will investigate the cost of both the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma at the individual and the population level. Together, these results will help to understand the actual impact of coronavirus on individuals with long-term conditions, and may inform health service and public planning.","The coronavirus pandemic has had unprecedented effects on all aspects of society. As health system responses grapple with second waves and roll-out of vaccination, it is important to understand the actual impact on individuals with long-term conditions. In this project, we intend to use CPRD linked database to better understand the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Using a cohort of these patients, we will describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in this population in terms of incidence and prevalence across different severity levels of COVID-19 and severity classes of asthma and COPD. In addition, we will determine COVID-19-related and all-cause clinical and healthcare resource use outcomes among these patients, including the demographic, disease-related, comorbidity-related, and treatment-related factors associated with mortality, COVID-19-related complications and the incurring of healthcare resource use. This study will utilise both CPRD Aurum and CPRD GOLD database and the study period will begin on 1 January 2010 until the last GP’s collection day. Each of the clinical outcomes of interest will be described separately. Event rates and 95% CIs will be reported as both incidence risks and incidence rates. Relative risks and risk factors associated with outcomes will be estimated using Cox regression models. In addition, we aim to further evaluate the care pathways of the patients to understand the health resource use and the financial cost of the direct and indirect burden of disease, including hospital admission, ITU admission and GP visits. Such evidence will be used to highlight any unmet treatment needs and inform modelling of the impact of the pandemic in other patient subpopulations, and will aid planning for future pandemics.","•	Death (all cause, COVID-19, non-COVID-19, respiratory, cardiovascular)

The reasons for this are unclear, although early research has shown that this is not entirely explained by the fact that people with diabetes are more likely to be older and have other health conditions. This means it is likely that something about having diabetes itself is making people more at risk.

We will study a large number of people with diabetes, to gather evidence on the characteristics of people with diabetes who get very unwell with COVID-19. We will look in detail if the type of diabetes a person has, and how severe the diabetes is, is linked to the risk of developing severe COVID-19. We will explore the influence of, in particular blood sugar levels and routine blood tests, diabetes duration, medication use, and diabetes complications. Finally, we will describe the longer-term health of people with diabetes who recover from COVID-19, up to one year after infection. For the study we will make use of routinely collected data from GP practice to provide very detailed information on people with diabetes, in combination with hospital care records and national death records. Findings will be shared rapidly to help guide care for people with diabetes.","Diabetes is one of the most common comorbidities seen in people with COVID-19. As the pandemic has progressed, worse prognoses for people with diabetes who contract COVID-19 have been reported in population-based studies, with an increased risk of intensive care admission and higher mortality in the majority of hospital cohorts. This study will use Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) primary care records, linked to Second Generation Surveillance (SGSS) data for COVID-19 testing, and COVID-19 hospital records (Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS), Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC)). In people with diabetes we will identify those infected with COVID-19, and those who develop severe COVID-19. We will examine diabetes specific clinical prognostic factors for development of severe COVID-19 (a composite endpoint of mortality, admission to hospital critical care, ventilation, renal dialysis/filtration, or high-low oxygen), in particular blood glucose control and routine blood tests, diabetes duration, diabetes complications and medication. Advanced methods to control for measured and unmeasured confounding, including the Prior Event Rate Ratio method, will be used to evaluate specific prognostic factors, in particular medication use. We will also examine longer-term outcomes, up to one year, in people with diabetes who recover from COVID-19 infection, compared to a matched control population of COVID-19 unexposed people with diabetes. The study will provide robust data on whether potentially modifiable risk factors such as hyperglycaemia and medication alter risk of developing severe COVID-19, and establish if there are subgroups of people with diabetes that differ to a clinically relevant degree in COVID-19 outcome. We will work with Diabetes UK, the study funder, to rapidly disseminate findings.","Primary outcome: 

Severe Covid-19 infection identified, in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, using a composite of: All-cause death, or admission to a critical care unit, or mechanical ventilation, or non-invasive ventilation, new commencement of renal dialysis/filtration, or requirement for high flow oxygen, within 30 days of COVID-19 infection.

They frequently coexist, but are studied separately in terms of what increases their risks and outcomes following diagnosis. Better understanding of the effects of combinations of these three diseases may aid earlier diagnosis and prevention. 
We will investigate the characteristics and outcomes of individuals with heart failure, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease using electronic health records, by both traditional epidemiologic approaches as well as machine learning. Machine learning uses artificial intelligence to learn patterns from the data with or without the need to define them by labelling information. It has been used to identify novel disease definitions, but usually restricted to single diseases and smaller samples which may be unrepresentative of the whole population. We will use machine learning to see if new subtypes of the diseases can be discovered in patients with overlapping heart failure, diabetes mellitus and chronic disease. Machine learning will be used to assign patients into groups according to their clinical features (e.g. diagnoses, lab results). This research may improve prediction of the risk of particular outcomes, as well as providing novel insights into mechanism of action of current and new therapies.","The project intends to work on complex data to better understand how to define phenotypes and discover sub-phenotypes of three common diseases: heart failure (HF), diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to traditional epidemiologic analyses, unsupervised machine learning approaches such as clustering have been adopted with the intention of recognising disease subtypes. However, those analyses are mostly confined to individual diseases and specific patient sub-groups, which may lead to inaccurate categorisation and consequently inaccurate diagnostics. Furthermore, these three diseases are frequently risk factors for each other, and sometimes co-exist but the ""overlap"" syndrome of all three is understudied. Therefore, we aim:

- To study baseline characteristics and outcomes of this overlap syndrome and outcomes, and compare with the individual diseases (HF, DM, and CKD).
- To describe the missed opportunities in guideline recommended care pathway leading to HF and/or CKD diagnosis in DM vs non-DM patients and the patients' characteristics along the care pathway.
- To use combined unsupervised and supervised statistical learning to identify sub-phenotypes of HF, DM and CKD.
- To use machine learning (supervised, unsupervised or combined) to identify clusters in the overlap syndromes between HF, DM and CKD",#NAME?,"Dr Jil Billy Mamza - Chief Investigator - Astra Zeneca Ltd - UK Headquarters

However, there remains a lack of effective treatment options for this disease. Thus, in response to this and the rising number of affected individuals, research has been geared towards identification of risk factors and potential prevention strategies. Recently, mounting evidence has pointed towards the potential role of infections in the development of dementia. While prior studies have looked into this, they had several issues and were relatively small-scale. Using a large database from the United Kingdom, we will reassess this question by comparing patients with and without a history of infection and their risk of developing dementia. We hope the findings from this study can provide insight on the role of infections in dementia in order to inform the development of prevention strategies, such as vaccination programs, to reduce infections at the population level.","Given the ageing population, the prevalence of dementia is projected to triple in the upcoming years. Recently, mounting evidence has pointed towards the potential role of infectious burden in the pathophysiology of dementia. Currently, however, there remains a lack of high quality epidemiological evidence on the association between clinically apparent infections and the risk of dementia. Considering the rapidly growing number of individuals affected with dementia, future large-scale population-based studies are warranted on this potential association.

Our hypothesis is that infectious burden caused by clinically apparent infections is associated with an increased risk of dementia. To investigate this potential association, we will conduct a cohort study with a nested case-control analysis using a cohort of all patients in the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink at least 50 years of age between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 2019. Within this cohort, each dementia case will be matched with up to 40 dementia-free controls on sex, age (Â±1 year), cohort entry date (Â±90 days), and duration of follow-up. Conditional logistic regression will be used to compute odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals of incident dementia associated with having a history of infectious burden, compared with having no history of infectious burden. In secondary analyses, we will assess the association by cumulative number of infections (1, 2-3, and >3 infections) and by age (<65 and >/=65). Finally, we will conduct several sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our results, including restricting the outcome definition to Alzheimer's disease and accounting for time-dependent confounding over the follow-up period. Ultimately, we hope the findings from this large population-based study can provide insight on the association between infectious burden and the risk of dementia in order to develop novel avenues for future preventive strategies.","The primary outcome of interest is incident diagnosis of dementia, as identified by Read codes.","Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

Acute heart failure often leads to very severe outcomes including death. We are also interested in understanding the risk factors for longer-term cardiovascular outcomes in COVID-19 patients such as chronic heart failure. Those with cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, and who have experienced cardiovascular conditions in the past, seem to be at increased risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes. However, studies have reported several cases of cardiovascular events following a COVID-19 diagnosis in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease. It appears that the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, might be capable of directly causing damage to the heart and more research is required to understand which patients are likely to benefit from dedicated, specialist cardiac care and monitoring. This study will use Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data to collate cardiovascular risk factors in COVID-19 patients to assess their association with cardiovascular events including acute heart failure, chronic heart failure and death. We will analyse data from patients who have diagnoses of heart failure or other cardiovascular conditions, comparing risk factors and disease progression among those with a preceding COVID-19 diagnosis to those without.","Cardiovascular risk factors and heart conditions have been associated with increased risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes. Several hospitalised COVID-19 patients have developed cardiovascular outcomes including acute heart failure, chronic heart failure, pulmonary edema and myocardial infarction. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease seems to be an important driver of COVID-19 severity, however other studies have noted serious cardiovascular outcomes in COVID-19 patients without a history of cardiovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 could directly induce myocardial damage, potentially via the proinflammatory cytokine storm. We seek to improve evidence in this area for earlier identification of COVID-19 patients at high risk of cardiovascular outcomes who could benefit from dedicated cardiac monitoring and early referral to specialist teams. We will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum and GOLD datasets to conduct a population cohort study, evaluating outcomes among patients experiencing cardiovascular events following COVID-19 diagnosis. Outcomes will be hospital readmission and mortality within 60 days following cardiovascular diagnoses. Cox proportional hazards regression models will use hazard ratios to compare outcomes to a matched cohort of patients who have similar cardiovascular diagnoses but no COVID-19 diagnosis, adjusting for covariates including gender and deprivation and comparing risk profiles between groups. Cardiovascular disease risk factors will be compiled including smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and body mass index. Hospital admissions and cardiovascular events will be identified using the Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care registry. We will use the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Death Registration Data for mortality data if possible, but note that the latest release (set 20) only covers up to June 2020. Should there be no further release prior to initiating our analysis, we will use the CPRD Aurum and GOLD death dates instead. A secondary analysis will evaluate longer-term cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 using CPRD data on relevant prescriptions including diuretics and anticoagulants.","Primary analysis

1616634489-2671,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=2,Excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Tracking of deaths in the population over time (mortality) is an essential part of monitoring and predicting the likely course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 is problematic as likelihood of stating COVID-19 on the death certificate will have changed over time and may have been inconsistently applied across settings. Excess deaths by week from any cause could provide a more objective and comparable way of assessing the scale of the pandemic and formulating lessons to be learned. It is constructed by comparing the deaths over time since the start of the pandemic to the number expected based on the experience of previous non-pandemic years. Crucially this method has as the outcome all-cause mortality data, sidestepping the problems associated with attribution of cause of death to COVID-19.

Standalone national mortality data will allow tracking of excess mortality over time, but CPRD uniquely includes timely data on deaths alongside extensive clinical and demographic data, backed up by periodic linkages to national mortality data. This study will exploit this important combination of demographic/clinical and death data to examine how excess mortality during the course of the pandemic differs in individuals with different characteristics (e.g. age, sex, smoking) including pre-existing illnesses (e.g. respiratory disease, heart disease, diabetes). The study will provide key information to inform clinical guidance, resource planning and policies for protecting the most vulnerable.","In recognition of limitations of cause-specific death data, estimates of excess mortality are routinely used to estimate and compare deaths due to seasonal influenza epidemics. These are based on national death registration data which allows for stratification by age, sex and geographic region. We aim to replicate these analyses for the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK with further stratification by COVID-19 effect modifiers that can be measured in primary care data.

Time series methods will be used in our primary analyses of observed mortality during the whole period (pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19) using generalised linear models with a negative binomial error structure. The main outcome is mortality, measured in primary care data using the CPRD derived death date and the main exposure is the pandemic period (1st March 2020 onwards). The model will initially include exposure, age, sex, and terms to capture seasonality and underlying year-on-year trends. Interaction terms will be used to investigate excess mortality during the pandemic according to demographic, lifestyle-related and comorbidity characteristics. Relative and absolute differences in excess mortality will be described.

We will compare our primary time series approach to national excess mortality estimates. In a secondary analysis to check conclusions, we will compare weekly mortality with expected mortality based on comparable week-of-year mortality in the years prior to the pandemic (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) approach). We will also explore an approach based on individual-level cohort data, with the pandemic period included as a time-updated variable. In secondary analyses we will use updated linked ONS mortality data when available to repeat the analysis using the ONS death date and HES APC data to improve ascertainment of comorbidities.",All-cause mortality,"Krishnan Bhaskaran - Chief Investigator - London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM )

It affects 1 in 40 people, many of whom suffer recurrent flares. People get gout because the level of urate in their blood is too high. Long-term treatment for gout involves taking a tablet, usually allopurinol, to lower urate levels and prevent future flares.

Although the long-term aim of treatment with allopurinol is to prevent future flares, when allopurinol is first started it can trigger a gout flare. To stop this from happening, guidelines recommend taking a second tablet called colchicine so that starting allopurinol does not trigger a flare. However, colchicine can cause significant side-effects such as diarrhoea and problems with nerves and muscles. These side-effects are thought to be more common in people with kidney disease and people taking certain tablets, such as statins. However, it is not known how often these side-effects occur or whether the risk of them is genuinely increased by other medical problems or other tablets.

This study will find out:
 - How common side-effects of colchicine are when people start taking allopurinol for gout?
 - Which factors are linked to risk of these side-effects?

This research will benefit patients and the NHS by:
 - Enabling patients and doctors to make better informed treatment decisions.
 - Providing new evidence about the risk of side-effects of colchicine when people start allopurinol for gout.
 - Helping doctors to work out who is at higher risk of side-effects from taking colchicine.
 - Informing guidelines on safe and appropriate prescribing of colchicine.","Gout affects 2.5% of adults in the UK and causes flares of severe joint pain and swelling. Long-term treatment for gout involves taking urate-lowering drugs (e.g. allopurinol) to prevent flares. However, allopurinol initiation commonly triggers a gout flare, hence co-prescription of prophylactic colchicine to prevent flares is recommended. There is little evidence concerning the safety of colchicine prophylaxis despite colchicine being known to interact with several commonly prescribed drugs.

We will describe the safety of colchicine prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol treatment for gout, and assess prognostic factors for colchicine side-effects.
Specific objectives are to determine, in patients with gout prescribed colchicine prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol: 
1. Risk of colchicine-related adverse events severe enough to warrant seeking healthcare;
2. Incidence of co-prescribing of drugs with the potential to interact with colchicine;
3. Prognostic factors for adverse events.


The study will be undertaken using linked primary care and Hospital Episode Statistics data.

Work-package 1
Matched, retrospective cohort study. The incidence of colchicine-related adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, neuropathy, myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and bone marrow suppression) will be compared using Cox proportional hazards regression between patients with gout initiating allopurinol with and without colchicine. Matching will be based on propensity scores.

Work-package 2
Using the exposed group from the work-package 1, we will describe the proportion of people with gout initiating allopurinol with colchicine prophylaxis who have a current prescription for medications (statins, fibrates, verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin, amiodarone, oral ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics) that could potentially interact with colchicine.

Work-package 3
Type II prognosis study. In the same exposed group, we will assess potential prognostic factors (age, gender, body mass index, chronic kidney disease, multimorbidity and co-prescriptions) for adverse events. Absolute risk of adverse events by potential prognostic factors will be quantified and Cox regression used to examine potential risk factors for adverse events.","Work packages 1 and 3

(Data as of 10-November-2020) While there are now hundreds of vaccine trials globally, checks on their safety will be paramount, and monitoring of side effects will be necessary. The ability to identify and understand the background rates of Adverse Events of Special Interests (AESI) for COVID-19 vaccines is critical for future vaccine safety surveillance.
Meanwhile, although some studies had been done in the background rates, the algorithms of identifying the outcomes in electronic health records, especially in Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), varies between studies. Even if there are commonly used clinical case definition, the interpretation from clinical description to database algorithms could be different as well. In this study, we aim to identify and evaluate selected AESI in the electronic health records data from General Practice and hospitals, and to estimate the incidence rates of AESI in the UK population, and after viral infections like influenza and COVID-19. 
This study will inform the identification of AESI in CPRD, and provide key information on the disease characteristics of AESI in the general UK population. This information will help future safety studies of COVID-19 vaccines when available.","The global pandemic of COVID-19 has resulted in over 50 million reported cases and over 1.2 million deaths globally. Meanwhile, hundreds of vaccines are in clinical evaluation and some show clinical efficacy. While planning for the large-scale immunization program, it is important to understand the potential adverse events after vaccination or viral infections. Electronic health records, including CPRD, have been increasingly used in safety studies. The ability to and the reliability of capturing the adverse events using suitable phenotyping algorithms in such databases are the foundation in conducting these studies. We will firstly identify the phenotyping algorithms of the AESI used in other studies, or develop the phenotypes if no existing one is found. Then we will evaluate the performance of these phenotypes using the diagnostic and evaluation tool that had been previously developed. The second objective is to estimate the background incidence rates (IR) of the AESI among the general population from the year 2006 to 2019. Individuals who were observed for at least 365 days during the study period will be included. The numerator of the incidence rate will be the total number of incident cases in each year, and the denominator will be person-time at risk each year. We will also estimate the IR among patients who were diagnosed or received a positive test for COVID-19 (after 31-Jan-2020) or seasonal influenza. We will apply different algorithms in identifying both the exposures and the outcomes. A tested negative cohort will be identified using primary care data as a negative control group as well. We will then carry on a self-controlled case series analysis to exam the association between developing the AESI and COVID-19 or influenza infections using the conditional Poisson regression model.

Therefore, we will have a good understanding of the risk of any more common side-effects within the trial population which, if the vaccine is authorised for introduction, will be mild and outweighed by the expected benefits. However, following introduction of a vaccine, and use in larger populations, suggestions of very rare but more serious potential side-effects can start to emerge. These concerns are often unfounded, whereby events are linked with the vaccine due to their timing but are in fact not caused by the vaccine. However, they can also on rare occasions be due to a true side-effect. Therefore, once a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced it is important that the risk of rare events is actively monitored in order to both provide evidence on vaccine safety, mitigating the impact of unfounded scares which can discourage people from being vaccinated and provide them with reassurance, as well as to rapidly detect any true safety concerns. This monitoring study will include weekly analyses to generate signals of potential rare risks where we see higher rates of an event occurring in patients than is expected given the natural occurrence of such events in unvaccinated people. Any concerns will then be further explored to ascertain if they are related to the vaccine and changes made to the vaccination programme to ensure safety if necessary.","Sequential tests have been applied within longitudinal patient records for the timely detection of safety signals related to vaccines in the US. The purpose of this approach is to allow repeated interrogation of the data, starting immediately after the vaccine is introduced and adjusting for multiple analyses, in order to rapidly detect any increases in risk for pre-identified adverse events of special interest (AESI) potentially associated with vaccination. The feasibility of conducting these analyses has been previously explored in the CPRD. In brief, this active monitoring approach uses repeated application of the Maximised Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MaxSPRT) at pre-defined time points to assess the rate of pre-identified AESI compared to a control. A signal is triggered if the relative risk crosses a pre-defined threshold. AESIs are prospectively identified based on clinical trial data, experience with other vaccines, and knowledge on events that occur naturally in the target population and which may be reported in temporal association with vaccination. Several potential COVID-19 vaccines are in development and once one or several are available deployment across a large population could be very rapid. Following introduction, these sequential methods will be implemented for a full range of AESI. This will allow the size of the evidence base on vaccine safety to grow from first use and in line with the exposed population. These methods will be implemented as part of the UK regulatory portfolio of COVID-19 vaccine vigilance activities. The totality of the data will be used to support communications on the safety of the vaccine to mitigate unfounded safety scares, which can be triggered by small numbers of serious unexpected events, and to rapidly detect any true rare risks should they occur informing the need for changes to the vaccination programme to ensure safety if necessary.","Incidence of AESI. The pre-defined list of AESI is:

Sudden death (all ages, including SIDS in infants); Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other peripheral and polyneuropathies; Multiple sclerosis, and other demyelinating disorders; Optic neuritis; Encephalitis (including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis); Myasthenia gravis; Bell’s palsy; Seizure disorders (including febrile); Myocardial infarction; Myo/pericarditis; Stroke and other cerebrovascular events; Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune thrombocytopenia; Rheumatoid arthritis, polyarthritis; Autoimmune thyroiditis; Kawasaki syndrome (Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19)

Many deaths from COVID-19 infection have occurred in people with underlying health conditions such as heart disease. Damage to the heart has also been seen among people who have died from COVID-19. We do not yet know exactly which groups of people are most at risk of developing heart problems or dying after COVID-19. However, it is likely that people whose cardiovascular risk level is already raised, e.g. because they have high blood pressure, may be at higher risk. Currently though, these people are not included in any lists of vulnerable groups and so will not be prioritised to receive a future COVID-19 vaccine.

In this study, we aim to investigate whether adults aged 40 years or over who are at raised cardiovascular risk because of factors such as high blood pressure have a greater chance of dying or developing heart problems after COVID-19 infection than those with low cardiovascular risk levels. We will use anonymous data from GP and hospital records and laboratories to compare rates of heart problems and deaths after COVID-19 infection, controlling for factors such as other underlying health conditions. We will carry out two research studies with different designs to improve confidence in our results. This will help policymakers to understand which groups should be prioritised for COVID-19 vaccine.","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to >one million deaths worldwide. Hospitalisations and deaths are common among patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors such as hypertension, while myocardial injury is frequently observed among severe COVID-19 cases and is strongly associated with mortality. A wide range of other respiratory viruses and bacteria can trigger acute cardiovascular events among vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, people at raised cardiovascular risk but without existing cardiovascular disease have not been identified as a risk group for severe COVID-19 by Public Health England. Information is urgently needed on the risk of adverse outcomes after infection for those at raised cardiovascular risk to ensure that policymakers have the best evidence to target a future COVID-19 vaccine appropriately.

We aim to investigate the effect of having a raised cardiovascular risk level, defined initially by QRISK3 score and then by hypertension status, or by the presence of existing cardiovascular disease, on severe outcomes of COVID-19. We will use linked data from general practices, hospital admissions and national laboratory and hospital surveillance for COVID-19 to compare mortality rates and the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events after laboratory-confirmed infection among those aged 40 years or over with differing levels of cardiovascular risk. After describing incidence rates of the outcomes by cardiovascular risk group, we will carry out a cohort study using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios for each outcome after COVID-19 infection in the different risk groups. We will then conduct a complementary self-controlled case series study, which implicitly controls for the effect of fixed confounding factors, by level of cardiovascular risk to triangulate results. We will finally carry out a series of sensitivity analyses including exploring the effect of clinical and suspected COVID-19 infection among those without laboratory test results to check the robustness of our models.","Cohort study:

One in five patients experience complications, increasing their risk of a longer hospital stay, being re-admitted after discharge home, not returning to their baseline independence, and early death. Additionally, complications lead to increased NHS costs and resource use. 
Significant public resources are used to try to better understand the long-term effects of surgery. Clinicians must measure and manually record information about patients' health, quality of care and what happens to them after their hospital stay. Much of this information already exists somewhere within the NHS, in electronic health records held by general practitioners (GPs) or in the routine data collected in hospitals. However, this data is not routinely shared, thus duplicating effort and potentially wasting NHS resources.
Combining patient data from hospitals and GPs in England will provide a more complete picture of the journey undertaken by patients undergoing major surgery. This will improve our understanding of the scale and type of complications occurring after surgery, which patients are more at risk, and whether this affects where and how often they access healthcare. This should help patients and healthcare professionals make better plans together to reduce these risks. Using linked data in this way may reduce the burden of data collection on local hospitals, so contributing to improved patient care and saving NHS resources.","Occurring in 20% of adults undergoing major surgery, perioperative complications have important implications for patients and the NHS: increased healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU); reduced quality of life; reduced long-term survival. Collecting patient data on postoperative complications is burdensome and costly. The Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) coding system does not differentiate between pre-existing comorbidities and complications sustained during a hospital episode. Furthermore, little is known about the prevalence, magnitude and cost of complications which develop or continue after discharge from hospital and are managed in primary care. 
This retrospective cohort study will use HES-linked CPRD data to determine the feasibility of using linked data to identify HES discharge diagnoses not present pre-operatively within HES or CPRD, thereby identifying complications. Adult patients undergoing major surgery between 2008 to 2018 will be selected within HES using pre-defined procedure codes. We will develop clinical phenotyping algorithms to discover patients within the CPRD Aurum database who experienced complications within 30 days of surgery. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate hazard ratios for the associations between pre-existing co-morbidities, post-operative complications and HCRU. Using a cost-of-illness approach, we will investigate the trajectory, magnitude and determinants of HCRU before and after surgery, and ascertain the patient risk factors that have the greatest impact on different outcomes. We will attempt to validate our methods using a separate group of patients from the CPRD GOLD database.

Side effects of vacines that are currently being developed are  concern, especially with the large number of people that will be use such a vaccine after it becomes avaialble. When new vaccines are launched on a market and used at a large scale, monitoring of adverse events post-immunisation are necessary to ensure a proper evaluation of the benefit-risk profile of vaccines. Methods for monitoring such side effects rely on accurate background rates of the event under evaluation. In the absence of these background rates, occurrence of rare events or an apparent increase in more common events can be interpreted as a signal of an unsafe vaccine. In this multi-country study that includes data from UK CPRD, background rates of a 38 different side effects will be calculated within the general population in the period 2017-2020, also  looking within relevant population subgroups (e.g. age, sex, certain medical conditions) . Results can be used to give context to future data from prospective covid-19 vaccine monitoring studies and spontaneous reporting databases, and thereby, to help identify potential safety signals.","The global rapid spread of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV2 triggered the need for developing vaccines to control for this pandemic. This study will generate background incidence rates of adverse events of special interest (AESI) that may be used to monitor benefit-risk profile of upcoming COVID-19 vaccines. A retrospective multi-database dynamic cohort study will be conducted over the period 2017 to 2020 using 10 healthcare databases in 7 European countries, including UK CPRD. The study population will include all individuals observed in for at least one day during the study period (01 January 2017 - last data availability) and who have at least 1 year of data availability before cohort entry, except for individuals with data available since birth. Outcomes of interest include 38 different AESI, as defined by relevant Read/Snomed/ICD-10 codes, using both GP and HES data. Person-time of interest in CPRD will be based on the standard relevant patient and practice dates. Several at-risk medical conditions will be used as stratification factors. Incidence rates by calendar year will be calculated by dividing the number of incident cases (not in run-in year) (numerator) by the total person-time at risk (denominator).

1616633614-2307,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=20,Risk of Serious Infections in Patients with Psoriasis: a Cohort Study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink,"Psoriasis is a common skin disease affecting around 3% of the population of the UK. People with psoriasis suffer from patches of red, flaky skin that can appear in any part of the body. Many studies have found that having psoriasis was associated with having other medical conditions affecting the heart, the kidneys, and the liver, and these conditions, along with having sore and red skin, lead some people with psoriasis to worry about an increased risk of infection.  However, we do not know whether having psoriasis is associated with getting infections that are serious enough to lead to an admission to a hospital.  

A previous study in the Netherlands showed that patients with psoriasis do have a higher risk of serious infections, but this finding has not been thoroughly investigated or repeated in studies of patients of other nationalities. Understanding the risk of infection in patients with psoriasis is important because in addition to the risk of the disease, patients with psoriasis often have to take treatments to suppress the immune system, which may further increase this risk. On the other hand, scientists have shown that psoriasis is associated with increased production of molecules called anti-microbial peptides, which are thought to help the skin guard against infections. There are some suggestions, therefore, that having psoriasis may in fact be protective against infections of the skin.  

Our aim is to examine whether the risk of serious infection is higher in patients with psoriasis, or whether patients with psoriasis are specifically protected against skin infections.","Our aim is to investigate whether patients with psoriasis are at an increased risk of hospitalisation due to infection, death due to infection and at a decreased risk of hospitalisation due to cellulitis. A matched cohort study will be used. Adult patients identified using a Read coded diagnosis of psoriasis between 01/04/2003 and 31/12/2016, and eligible for linkage to outpatient and inpatient HES and ONS records will be matched (on age, gender and practice) with 6 unaffected comparison patients. Selection will be restricted to patients registered with a contributing practice for at least one year and follow-up will end when the patient either dies, transfers out of the practice, last data collection, the end of the study period, or experiences the outcome of interest. The outcome of first hospitalisation due to infection; and infection-related mortality will be defined according to ICD-10 classifications. Cox regressions will be used to investigate whether patients with psoriasis have a higher risk of hospitalisation due to any infection or due to cellulitis specifically. Hazard ratios (HRs) will be generated with and without adjustment for potential confounders. Adjustment will be made for patient-level deprivation, body mass index, presence of co-morbidities including diabetes, COPD/Asthma, HIV/AIDS, alcohol intake, Charlson Comorbidity 7Index and smoking status. Missing data will be accounted for using multiple imputation.",The main outcomes of the study will be: 1. incidence of first hospitalisation due to infection (including the subcategories of respiratory infections; skin and soft tissue infections; and urinary tract infections); 2. Death due to infection.  We will examine death and hospitalisation reasons according to the International Code of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) code lists.,"Professor Darren Ashcroft - Chief Investigator - University of Manchester

Hypoglycaemia significantly impairs the quality of life and could potentially increase the risk of future cardiovascular complications (for example, heart attack or stroke). 
In this study, we aim to identify in patients with diabetes and the characteristics (for example, age or ethnicity) which are related to a higher risk of complications after an episode of hypoglycaemia. This is relevant because the risk of future cardiovascular complications and death can be very different in patients with diabetes; it could be very high is some patients and low in others. To date, however, the characteristics associated with an increased risk are not known.
In this view, we will first identify the characteristics associated with a higher risk in patients who have experienced hypoglycaemia; then, we will develop a model which can be used by health care professionals to estimate the risk of death or cardiovascular complications","This study covers the research area related to the risk stratification of long-term complications associated with severe hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes. 
Firstly, using data collected in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Gold database with linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS), we will investigate the association between severe hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and how other risk factors, such as co-morbidities and medications use, act as effect modifiers of their association.  Therefore, a cohort of diabetic patients will be identified within CPRD and their exposure status (hypoglycaemia, exposed; non-hypoglycaemia, unexposed) will be defined with linkage to HES. The outcomes all-cause and cause-specific deaths will be identified via linkage to ONS. Time-to-event analysis will be used to estimate the hazard associated with specific risk factors, their interactions, and their relationship with survival probabilities (i.e., absolute risk).
Secondly, the same cohort will be used to develop and validate risk prediction models for all-cause, cardiovascular, and non-cardiovascular mortality. Model's performance will be assessed using well-established statistical methods, including discrimination, calibration, and reclassification indices. The discrimination indices will quantify, in particular, the added value of including information on severe hypoglycaemia to estimate the risk of outcomes. Moreover, model's prediction ability will be evaluated across characteristics of patients.","- All-cause mortality

Some cancers may eventually spread into other tissues. There are more than 200 different types of cancer. Staging and grading of cancer give an idea of how quickly a cancer may grow and which treatments may work best. Treatments can include surgery, radiotherapy and drug treatments (such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy or targeted cancer drugs).

The purpose of this study is to understand the treatment and outcomes of patients diagnosed with different types of cancer in England. This research will help to characterise the treatments patients receive and their use of healthcare services following treatment.  This research will help to provide an up-to-date picture of the treatment and potential unmet needs of patients with these cancers in England.","According to Cancer Research UK, there were around 357,000 new cases of cancer in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2014, however there is limited recent real-world data on cancer patients in the UK. The rationale of this study therefore is to fill this evidence gap and describe the treatment patterns and healthcare resource use of patients with a number of cancers in England. Specifically, the aims are to understand patient characteristics (demographic and clinical) and survival rates. In order to do this, the study will link data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episodes Statistics, National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service and Office of National Statistics (ONS) in order to provide the most accurate data on patient diagnoses and clinical characteristics. 

The number and proportion of patients receiving systemic anti-cancer treatment in each of the disease areas of interest will be described. Rates of adverse events following the initiation of treatment will be described by person time at risk. The healthcare resource use of patients following initiation of treatment will also be described including rates of GP attendances, hospital admissions and length of hospital stays.

A retrospective cohort study,"Our aim is to determine whether people with rheumatological conditions are more likely than other patients to harm themselves intentionally (self-harm). We hope such knowledge will be beneficial by;

- providing new information to general practitioners to support the prompt identification of at-risk patients
- reducing the number of patients who cause themselves harm

In the UK, the number of men and women who see their GP about self-harm has been increasing over the last decade. As such, finding ways to prevent self-harm needs to be a priority for healthcare systems. One approach to reducing self-harm is to target groups that are high-risk; For example, previous research has shown patients with long-term health problems, such as high blood pressure, are more likely to harm themselves. However, we do not know whether this is also the case for patients with rheumatological conditions, who experience many of the same problems as those people who do hurt themselves intentionally (for example; depression, chronic pain). As it remains unclear whether these patients are more likely to harm themselves, then further examination into any relationship between the presence of rheumatological conditions and subsequent self-harm is warranted.","Every year in UK primary care, there are 12.3 and 17.9 incident cases of self-harm per 10,000 male and female patients respectively. As such, primary care presents an opportunity to address self-harm and intervene in potential cases, with one recommended approach being to target groups who are at high-risk of self-harming. Patients with rheumatological conditions (Musculoskeletal rheumatological: osteoarthritis (OA), osteoporosis (OP) or fibromyalgia or Inflammatory rheumatological: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS)), who are often managed in primary care, are exposed to several known risk factors for self-harm (such as chronic pain, depression, anxiety) and are therefore potential at-risk groups.

Our research will examine whether patients with rheumatological conditions are more likely to self-harm than other comparable groups of patients. We will undertake a matched retrospective cohort study using data from the CPRD. Our primary outcomes of interest will be the prevalence and incidence of self-harm Read codes (CPRD). Cox proportional hazards models will be used to compare risk of self-harm in patients with rheumatological conditions compared to controls. Understanding the role each rheumatological condition has on self-harm could highlight vulnerable patients for clinicians to focus on or where new interventions may be necessary.","Aim 1: Cases with a rheumatological condition will be examined for subsequent self-harm codes. Self-harm will be based on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines (CG16) definition of self-harm and Read code list used in previous research (2) (Appendix 1). Specific characteristics within these rheumatological conditions will be reported (deprivation, anxiety, depression etc) and adjusted for when comparing to controls without a self-harm code. 

Aim 2: In the cohort of those with a rheumatological condition and self-harm, we will determine the role of several different patient characteristics on the risk of self-harming. These will include age, gender, level of deprivation and geographical area.","Dr James Prior - Chief Investigator - Keele University

In the UK patients from ethnic minorities make up a disproportionately large portion of patients receiving treatment for kidney failure but it's unclear why. Current guidelines on kidney disease take into account ethnicity in only a limited way, a more accurate way to measure kidney disease in patients with South Asian ethnicity has been proposed but not currently used. 
Using data from the CPRD data, this study aims to understand how using a more ethnic group specific calculation for kidney disease in South Asians could better predict the rate at which kidney failure develops, as well as heart disease which is linked to kidney disease, and deaths over a 10 year period. We will also compare the rate of kidney failure, and deaths over a 10 year period for South Asian patients compared to other ethnic groups. This project will highlight any systematic underdiagnoses of kidney disease in ethnic groups, differences in management, and any identify any need to change clinical practice in order to better improve outcomes.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 10% of the adult population, patients are identified using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration CKD (CKD EPI) equation.

The current method for detecting CKD may be improved upon using more ethnic group specific estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculations which is currently not carried out in clinical practice. 
We will carry out an observational, retrospective cohort database study using CPRD data. We will extract data for South Asian patients from the CPRD and compare the performance of an ethnic group specific eGFR formula in determining rate of decline in kidney function, development of cardiovascular complications, and mortality over a 10 year period versus the current non ethnic group specific eGFR formulae.

Finasteride and dutasteride are 5alpha-reductase inhibitors, medications that are commonly used to treat the symptoms of an enlarged prostate. While these medications are known to be effective at treating an enlarged prostate, recently there have been concerns that they may have negative effects, possible increases in risk of certain cancers, including cancer of the kidney, bladder and prostate, as well as other non-cancer effects such as dementia and diabetes. Few studies have investigated these potential harmful effects, and these studies have found mixed results, with some studies finding increases in risk while others found no difference. Given these discrepancies, new well-conducted studies are needed to assess these important safety questions. This study will aim to investigate whether the use of these medications increase the risk of these cancers and non-cancer events in men diagnosed with an enlarged prostate, providing important information for patients, physicians and regulatory agencies.","Evidence from preclinical and observational studies suggest that 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) may increase the risk of urological cancers. Similarly, emerging evidence suggests 5ARIs may be associated with a number of non-cancer adverse events, such as dementia and diabetes. However few observational studies have been conducted and these have had a number of limitations. Thus, the objective of this study will be to assess these adverse events by assembling a cohort of patients who received a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia from January 1 1998, from the CPRD, linked to the National Cancer Data Repository and ONS mortality data. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of adverse events associated with the use 5ARIs, compared with non-use of 5ARIs Secondary analyses will investigate whether the risk varies according to cumulative duration of use and time since medication initiation.

However, in some people, a cough can last for longer and a cough is defined as chronic if it lasts for eight weeks or more. The number of people with chronic cough in the UK has rarely been investigated. 
The aim of the study is to select people with chronic cough. People who visit the GP with a long-term cough may not be recorded as having chronic cough. It will therefore be important to distinguish people with chronic cough from those who frequently visit their GP with acute cough caused by respiratory infections. Phase I of this study will select people with at least one record of cough between March 2014 and February 2015. We will determine whether the cough was recorded as acute, chronic or of unspecified duration. The number and the time between cough episodes within the study year will be investigated.

Since no treatment is specific for these conditions, the findings of our study are expected to estimate the unmet needs and the future access landscape and identify the strategic solutions to access challenges with payer during the launch of new medicines.","The objectives of the study are (1) to estimate the prevalence of children and adults suffering from dRTA or cystinuria; (2) to study patient pathways; (3) and to evaluate the financial burden of medical care of these two conditions.
Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) databases, we will study the patients with a coded general practitioner (GP) diagnosis of dRTA and those with a coded diagnosis of cystinuria. Genetic dRTA and cystinuria are well diagnosed but acquired dRTA may be misdiagnosed since patients are suffering from various associated syndromes and/or several conditions with similar symptoms. These patients need to be studied in terms of treatment and pathways to be sure of the accuracy of the estimates.
The main analyses will consist of descriptive analyses to evaluate the prevalence of the two conditions in adult and children populations. Resource use for both inpatient (number of stays and length of stay, etc.) and outpatient (prescription items, referrals visits, etc.) will be estimated for these patients.
Finally, these estimates will be scaled up to the entire population and will be used to evaluate the financial burden of medical care of dRTA and cystinuria in the UK.","The first outcomes of interest will be GP diagnosis of dRTA and cystinuria. 
Then, various diagnosis codes will be studied as well as drug utilisation and referrals to specialist to identify additional patients possibly suffering from these two conditions but without a formal diagnosis. The codes related to associated syndromes or diseases with similar symptoms. The list of codes has been reviewed by a clinical expert in dRTA and cystinuria. 
The identification of the additional patients will be further validated by clinical expert opinion.
Once these patients have been identified, age and gender will be the variables of interest to estimate the global prevalence.
In a second step of our study, the resource use (hospitalisations, laboratory tests, specialist's referrals...) will be the outcomes of interest.","Miss Monique Martin - Chief Investigator - Not from an Organisation

However, recent studies have shown that the prescription of these drugs is increasing, suggesting that these drugs could be prescribed to patients too readily, and for non-approved indications (off label-use). Recently, the UK government reclassified gabapentin and pregabalin as controlled substances, after safety warnings following an increase in deaths related to their use. In this context, it could be relevant to better understand the patterns in the use of these medications. For this purpose, we will describe the trends over time in the prescription of gabapentin and pregabalin in the UK primary care between 1993 and 2017. We will also classify the medical drug indication for each patient starting on gabapentin or pregabalin. The findings of our study are expected to inform physicians and public health decision makers about the levels of gabapentin and pregabalin prescriptions over time, especially for non-approved indications.","The gabapentinoid drugs gabapentin and pregabalin are approved treatments for focal seizures and neuropathic pain, and were licensed in the UK in 1993 and 2004, respectively. Gabapentin is also licenced for the treatment of migraine in adults, while pregabalin is approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Recent data in the UK and elsewhere indicate that gabapentinoid prescriptions are increasing, raising concerns about potential off label-use of these drugs. Moreover, the UK government has recently reclassified these drugs as class C controlled substances, after an increasing number of deaths were found to be related to their use. Given these safety concerns and the implications of the widespread use of these medications, we will conduct a drug utilization study using CPRD data between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 2017. We will estimate annual prescription rates and 95% confidence intervals for gabapentin and pregabalin separately, using Poisson regression. We will also estimate the rates of incident users over time, both overall and stratified by indications and off-label indications. Our results will provide insight as to how gabapentinoids have been prescribed in UK primary care practices since their licensing and approval.","To estimate the yearly prescriptions rates of gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin, separately) in the UK primary care, between 1993 and 2017 in children, adolescents and adults; To estimate the yearly rate of patients with a first gabapentinoid prescription (incident users) overall and stratified by indication (epilepsy, neuropathic pain/migraine, generalized anxiety disorder (only for pregabalin), non-neuropathic pain (off-label indication), and other off-label indications).","Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

1616633582-2293,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=20,Comparative effectiveness of initial bronchodilator therapies in COPD,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease characterized by increasing breathlessness. It is a major cause of disability, it reduces quality of life and is one of the leading causes of death. An acute exacerbation of COPD can occur when there is a sudden worsening of usual COPD symptoms such as increased wheezing, shortness of breath, as well as presence of persistent cough, and when severe can require hospitalisation. Long-acting bronchodilators, including long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), are recommended as initial treatment for COPD.  However, most LABAs are dispensed with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in a fixed combination inhaler (LABA-ICS).  Thus, a real-world study of patients representative of clinical practice is of interest, with the benefit in reducing COPD exacerbations balanced against the increased risk of pneumonia. 

The objective of the study is to compare the benefit and risk of these initial treatments for COPD.  In particular, the study will compare the effectiveness of initial treatment with LABA-ICS versus LAMA in preventing the occurrence of COPD exacerbations and to compare their safety with respect to the risk of pneumonia, of concern when ICS are present.","The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of the initial long-acting bronchodilator treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In particular, long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) will be compared with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) combined with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in a single inhaler (LABA-ICS), since the majority of LABAs used in practice are prescribed in such a combined inhaler.  We will conduct a cohort study among patients with COPD to assess the effect of treatment initiation with a LAMA compared with LABA-ICS (single inhaler) on the time to a COPD exacerbation and on the risk of pneumonia. Each patient initiating treatment with a LAMA will be time-matched to a LABA-ICS initiator on high-dimensional propensity score, sex, and the presence of a prior acute COPD exacerbation in the year before cohort entry. Subjects will be followed for up to one year or until the occurrence of the outcome. The time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model will be used to perform an as-treated analysis to estimate the effect of current use of LABA-ICS versus LAMA on the risk of a first COPD exacerbation and pneumonia, stratifying by blood eosinophil levels, a recently identified potential biomarker of ICS response.","The primary outcome event is the first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation to occur after cohort entry. A moderate exacerbation will be defined by a new prescription for prednisolone and a severe exacerbation by a hospitalisation for COPD (ICD-10 codes: J41, J42, J43, J44). The first secondary outcome is the rate of COPD exacerbations over the one-year follow-up.  This outcome will be based on the number of courses of treatment with prednisolone and hospitalisations. A gap of at least 30 days between treatment courses will be required to consider the exacerbations as separate events. The second secondary outcome is the occurrence of the first community-acquired pneumonia and will be defined using the following codes: J10.0; J11.0; J12-J18; J22; J69; J85.0; J85.1; J86.

People with diabetes have higher glucose levels compared to healthy subjects (a condition defined hyperglycaemia). 
Hyperglycaemia for long time may cause complications to organs, such as problems to the heart and blood vessels (i.e., myocardial infarction). Therefore, it is important to reduce the concentration of blood glucose with appropriate interventions (for example, with oral glucose-lowering drugs or insulin) to reduce the risk of complications.
However, an over-controlled blood glucose is also dangerous as it could result in some side effects, the most common and important being hypoglycaemia (very low glucose levels). Hypoglycaemia is also associated with complication, including as loss of consciousness, abnormalities of the heart function, and coma, all of which can result in death.
It is important then to understand which people may be at higher risk of hyperglycaemia (under controlled) or hypoglycaemia (over controlled) with diabetes drug treatments. Using information from general practices in England, we will identify the types of characteristics that patients with low or high blood glucose levels have. We will also assess the risk of death in patients taking too many diabetes medications.","Using data collected in the CPRD Gold database with linkage to HES admitted patient care and ONS death registration, the primary aim of the study is to characterise patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at risk of overtreatment and undertreatment. Secondly, the characteristics associated with the risk of future outcomes will be identified in overtreated patients. In particular, this study will include a retrospective cohort of patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus aged over 30 years old and risk prediction models will be developed to estimate the probability for a patient to be overtreated with glucose-lowering medications (3 consecutive values of HbA1c <7% in patients on any insulin or any sulphonylurea and over 70 years old) and undertreated (3 consecutive values of HbA1c >8% in patients on any glucose-lowering drug and younger than 70 years old).

These can cause high levels of disability and reduce quality of life. There is a lack of information at the national level on the proportion of people with musculoskeletal pain who have it for a long time, or who have severe musculoskeletal pain. We also know little about how many people with musculoskeletal pain have problems working due to their pain. This information on musculoskeletal health is very important for healthcare professionals and policymakers.

Most people seeking health care for musculoskeletal pain will see a GP. Routinely recorded primary care data such as that in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) can provide information on the health of people with musculoskeletal pain. However patient self-reported information like impact on work and quality of life are not routinely recorded in general practice. We have already conducted a survey of adults aged 35 and over who saw their doctor for musculoskeletal pain in North Staffordshire. The purpose of this current study is to apply our models estimating musculoskeletal health that were developed from the 8000 people responding to that survey to CPRD data to obtain national estimates of musculoskeletal health status.","The objective is to provide a detailed description of musculoskeletal health in the UK for use by policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the public.

We have undertaken a survey in North Staffordshire which included questions on musculoskeletal health such as length of time with troublesome musculoskeletal pain, severity of pain, problems with everyday life, problems working due to pain, and health in general. The questionnaire was sent to people consulting their GP for common musculoskeletal conditions like osteoarthritis, and site-specific pain like back and shoulder pain. 8000 people responded and gave us consent to link their responses in the survey to their medical records. 

We are currently using information in their primary care records such as age, gender, number of consultations for musculoskeletal problems, time since first consultation, pain medications prescribed, other management, and other illnesses, to develop a statistical model to accurately estimate the answers given on their questionnaire.

Prescription of multiple medicines is associated with increased side effects, hospital admission and medical error, so should be reviewed regularly. However, there is no standard approach to ensure medicines reviews are done well.
We will describe current practice and find out whether an enhanced approach developed by clinical pharmacologists (medicines specialists) could improve this. We will identify a group of patients prescribed a high number of regular medicines in 2012 and find out how many had a recorded medicines review. We will describe factors that predict whether a patient got a review, who carried out the review (e.g. doctor, pharmacist) and what changes were made as a result (e.g. stopping medicines, changing dose). We will investigate whether the presence of a review had any effect on subsequent hospital admission or death.
We will then use a sample of patient records to improve our enhanced medicines review taking account of interrelationships between multiple medicines and diseases. We will compare the potential benefits of the enhanced review to the actual benefits of standard reviews. If the enhanced review appears beneficial we will test it in clinical practice.","Patients taking multiple medicines are at increased risk of adverse reactions, hospital admission and medication errors, and commonly do not adhere to treatment. National guidelines recommend that medicines should be optimised by annual review.
Our primary aim is to use CPRD to describe current practice relating to medicines reviews in patients at high risk of medicines-related harm (adults aged >50 years taking >10 concomitant medicines). We will describe the prevalence and frequency of medicines reviews, place and practitioner, factors predicting who gets a review, and resulting changes (e.g. stopping inappropriate medicines). We will investigate relationships between presence of review and subsequent hospital admission or death.

Some go on to have further heart problems after their first heart disease event and die prematurely, while others do not. Despite our knowledge about what causes heart disease and how to prevent it (smoking cessation, diet, exercise), we know little about factors that affect the chances of progression to a second event - which may be different. As a result we can't tell who is at higher risk for further problems and are limited to treating the usual risk factors we know about for first events, with little evidence supporting this approach. 

In this proposal we plan to use anonymous GP and hospital records to (1) see whether our usual cardiovascular risk factors are still important in people once they have developed heart disease (2) which other risk factors and diseases are relevant for disease progression (3) whether any existing drugs we already use for other conditions have any useful effects for this group and (4) whether we can combine this information into a risk score to try and better identify those at greatest risk of recurrent or subsequent heart problems.","Among patients surviving their first coronary heart disease (CHD) event, risk of further cardiovascular events remains high. Modifiers of subsequent event risk are poorly understood, compared to those for a first CHD event in the general population. Understanding these modifiers has important implications for secondary prevention of CHD.

We hypothesise that (1) traditional cardiovascular risk factors may have different relationships for first and subsequent CHD events (2) there are novel and specific risk factors relevant for subsequent CHD events (3) non-cardiac drugs may have unrecognized benefits or harms for subsequent event risk and (4) this information could be combined to generate better risk modelling for use in patients with established CHD.

Using linked electronic health records, we will use Cox proportional hazards to model the associations between risk factors and first CHD and subsequent CHD events. Further Cox models will be used to estimate the associations between non-cardiac drugs and risk of subsequent CHD events, adjusted for propensity scores which model probability of treatment to limit confounding by indication bias. Multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop risk prediction models for subsequent events.

It can be a symptom of both transient illness and serious disease; often making its cause difficult for GPs to diagnose. This ambiguity influences GP decision making, such as where to refer the patient for further investigation - thus potentially causing delays in diagnosis. Existing research has shown abdominal pain to be a prior symptom of nine different cancers. 
The aim of this research is to examine new cases of unexplained abdominal pain and to a) identify how many go on to have a cancer diagnosis in the next two years; b) categorise which cancers are diagnosed; c) investigate what co-symptoms are present for each cancer site and their impact on the chance of having cancer; d) use the results to recommend a best practice method of investigating abdominal pain; and, e) report what other diagnoses are found.
The results will help to guide GPs into providing appropriate action for patients with unexplained abdominal pain. They will also help to inform future policy on how best to investigate abdominal pain: in the GP surgery using ultrasound or in a specialist diagnostic clinic. New specialist clinics have been established, but have no relevant evidence to help them select the best sequence of tests for patients.","The revised 2015 National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines highlight abdominal pain as a feature of several cancers reported in the 12 months before the diagnosis. This study aims to quantify the overall and individual cancer site risk of unexplained new abdominal pain episodes reported to primary care in the 24 months following the AP episode, stratified by age and gender, and by accompanying symptoms. There is a need for a more effective diagnostic pathway, which may include primary care testing or extend to investigation in the newly-established multidisciplinary diagnostic centres (MDC).","1) To identify any new diagnosis of cancer in the two years (0-12 months and 13-24 months) following the first consultation with abdominal pain. The primary focus will be in the twelve months following the AP record, as the presence of AP is more likely to be related to the cancer than later diagnoses. A diagnosis of cancer will be ascertained by searching the clinical and referral files for medcodes (mapped to Read codes within the CPRD) relating to cancer. There are 2,134 medcodes relating to cancer within the CPRD. The diagnosis will be confirmed using cancer registry linkage. Information on cancer stage and grade will also be extracted. A sub-analysis of early versus late stage cancers will show if any investigation regime captures cancers preferentially. The date of diagnosis will be taken as the first recorded cancer code; where disparity between the CPRD and cancer registry exist, registry data will be prioritised.

2) What clinical features predict cancer in the abdominal pain group? (test: LR of cancer vs no cancer)

3) In the cancer group: Which specific features predict certain cancers a) firstly single cancers and b) cancers grouped by the diagnostic test of choice? 

4) Alternative diagnoses. In patients investigated for cancer, alternative explanations for AP may be found. We have assembled a short list of plausible conditions which are likely to be identified serendipitously by cancer investigation. This outcome is what other plausible causes of abdominal pain may be identified by cancer investigation in this cohort?","Dr Elizabeth Shephard - Chief Investigator - University of Exeter

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can be prescribed to alleviate these symptoms. 
In 2002, the results of the Women's Health Initiative Study (WHI) were published, indicating that users of HRT are at higher risk of developing breast cancer and cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke compared to non users. As a consequence, many women stopped their hormone replacement therapy. Meanwhile, the association between use of HRT and cardiovascular events has been questioned. 
The most recent information on HRT utilisation in the United Kingdom dates from 2005. We plan to describe the utilisation pattern of HRT in the United Kingdom between 2000 and 2016. We expect that the number of women using HRT has again increased since 2006, as more recent studies have revised the risk for adverse cardiovascular events associated with the therapy.","We plan to first perform a descriptive study in which we describe utilisation patterns of estrogen replacement therapy with or without progesterone (henceforth to be referred to as HRT) in postmenopausal women between 2000 and 2016.

People with HF often have poor quality of life, increased hospital admissions and die earlier. HF is often as a result of high blood pressure and heart attacks and worsens as a result of other conditions such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Previous studies have shown that these conditions differ among ethnic groups and yet the nature of the cause and consequences of HF in these populations is unknown. We don't know which of these conditions or other risk factors are most important for the development of HF in different ethnic groups or whether the factors that might make outcomes worse after HF onset differ among ethnic groups. This project will investigate (i) whether factors leading to HF have changed over the past 20-years and whether they differ among ethnic groups and (ii) after HF has developed, whether hospital utilisation and death rates have changed over time or differ among ethnic groups and whether the length of life following HF diagnosis differs by ethnic group. This evidence is important for the tailoring of primary prevention and risk reduction strategies to specific groups to improve outcomes.","Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of hospitalisation and death globally and is reaching epidemic proportions in the UK with predicted further growth as populations' age. HF has diverse aetiological pathways which might be triggered or moderated by wide ranging individual, clinical and environmental risk factors. Whilst UK evidence is limited, prior American studies have suggested that incidence of HF and its outcomes differ among ethnic groups. Furthermore, these disparities have been explained by differences in the risk factors and aetiological pathways leading to heart failure among groups, which may change as a result of population and social dynamics within specific groups.  In two phases this study aims to investigate (i) whether there are differences in aetiological or risk factors among ethnic groups with new onset HF in the UK and whether temporal changes exist over 20-years (ii) using Poisson models, investigate whether rates of hospital utilisation and deaths differ over time among ethnic groups (iii) using Cox regression, compare time to death following HF among ethnic groups and (iv) residual life and years of life lost due to HF onset, by ethnic group, will be estimated by quantifying standardised (adjusted) survival in people with and without HF.","All-cause admissions:
Hospital admissions will be identified through linkage of CPRD to HES data. Single hospital admissions will be defined by unique hospital spell numbers and date of admission will be used as the index admission date. For any admission with a discharge date at the end of the HES data year (31st March), subsequent admissions on the 1st April will be discounted. This is to allow for the artificial creation of two hospital spells by HES where one spell spans the end of HES data year.

Cause-specific admissions:
Three categories of cause-specific admissions will be used including HF, other cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular admissions. Codes will be based on ICD-10 codes as follows: Heart failure (I50), other cardiovascular (chapter IX 'diseases of the circulatory system' excluding I50) and non-cardiovascular (other ICD-10 chapters excluding chapter 1X). 

Hospital bed days:
Hospital bed days will be the total number of nights in hospital calculated by the difference between admission and discharge dates.

All-cause death:
The outcome will be all-cause mortality defined as death by any cause recorded in the patients CPRD or linked HES or ONS records. Given that there are a number of different entry types within the CPRD that indicate a death event and each has an associated date, there may be multiple records and dates for any one patient. The study date of death will be derived using a CPRD verified algorithm which takes the earliest of the patient transfer out date (with reason 'death'), first statement of death Read code or date of death/record added in the death administration area of the CPRD. Where death dates occur in all 3 linked records the earliest will be used.

Cause-specific death:
In England and Wales, there is a legal requirement to register all deaths with the Office of National Statistics (ONS) which provides a complete data source for mortality statistics including cause of death coded using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes.  However, assignment of a specific cause of death is subject to error, particularly when the patient has a number of underlying diseases or health factors. HF itself is considered a mediator between disease and death and is therefore ill-defined as a cause of death in favour of a more specific cause (such as myocardial infarction). HF is often applied where the aetiology is not known but this is not consistent and underreporting of circulatory diseases on death certificates is common. Conceptually, in considering HF as the cause of death, all deaths that are directly or indirectly caused by HF or its treatment should be included.36 An example would be a patient with HF who dies of renal failure secondary to the HF who is then coded with renal failure as the cause of death. 
So HF death might result in an aetiological cause being coded (such as myocardial infarction) or by a related cause subsequent to HF such as renal failure or respiratory arrest, with HF listed as an additional cause. Given the lack of sensitivity of heart failure death recording, cause-specific death will be defined in two ways. Firstly, by a ICD-10 code for HF (I50) as the primary 'underlying cause of death' or as any of the 'recorded causes of death' in the ONS record and secondly, by a broader definition including HF as the primary 'underlying cause of death' or as any of the 'recorded causes of death' or an 'other cardiovascular diseases' code used as the primary 'underlying cause of death'. Codes will be based on ICD-10 codes as follows: Heart failure (I50), other cardiovascular (chapter IX 'diseases of the circulatory system' excluding I50) and non-cardiovascular (other ICD-10 chapters excluding chapter 1X).
Date of death will be defined by the first entry in the merged HES-ONS file or CPRD but cause of death will use the merged HES-ONS file.","Dr Claire Lawson - Chief Investigator - University of Leicester

It is estimated that by the year 2030 COPD will be the third highest cause of mortality up from its current fourth place.  Smoking is primarily responsible for this highly debilitating disease. In England there are 7.3 million adult smokers and over 200 people die daily from smoking related illness which could have been prevented. Over 140,000 hospital admissions in the UK is due to COPD. A large proportion of deaths and disabilities is related to exacerbations. Acute exacerbation is the sudden worsening of symptoms in leading to difficulty in breathing, infections etc. in COPD patients. These events can lead to hospitalizations, which in turn increase healthcare expenditure. Understanding trends in exacerbations and related hospitalization can give attention to subgroups most affected by COPD within the UK, allow comparison between countries to aid healthcare planning, policy and provide a basis for improving management in the future. The aim of this study is to identify changes in COPD exacerbation and COPD hospitalization/ accident and emergency (A&E) visit from 2005 to 2013.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing approximately 3.2 million deaths annually. The disease is characterised by the presence of persistent airflow limitation, resulting primarily from proximal, peripheral airway and lung parenchyma obliteration. It is projected that by the year 2030 COPD will be the third highest cause of death globally. While smoking remains the major risk factor for the development of COPD, other factors include genetics and lifestyle. In the UK, mortality has increased from 2004-2012 while incidence decreased and then remained stable over the same period. There are over a million bed days and 140,000 hospital admissions each year in the UK due to COPD. A considerable amount of the burden from COPD is due to acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), defined as short periods of increased cough, dyspnoea, and sputum production. Understanding trends in exacerbations and related hospitalization can help redirect healthcare policies and interventions to subgroups most affected by COPD, allow comparison between countries to aid healthcare planning, predict future healthcare challenges, and provide a basis for improving management in the future. As such it's important to understand the trends in acute exacerbation of COPD and hospitalization/A&E visits for COPD.  
We will select all patients aged more than 40 years with a read code diagnosis of COPD  within the UK general practice. The date of the first COPD diagnosis will be the index date. The study will be from 1st January 2005 until December 2013, corresponding to the period since the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF).

COPD can lead to chronic breathing problems and even death. One of the main causes of this disease is smoking cigarettes, but the start of COPD can also be caused by other environmental and genetic factors. There is no cure for this disease, but symptoms can be managed. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) use are not effective in all patients, meaning some patients continue to have COPD related problems. We would like to be able to identify the people who will benefit from ICS treatment, in order to avoid use where clinical benefits of use are not apparent. ""Eosinophils"" are believed to help identify patients who will benefit from ICS. Patients with high eosinophil levels in their blood are believed to show worsening of their disease on withdrawal of ICS. These ICS are regularly prescribed in COPD patients in order to prevent exacerbations. The aim of the study is to investigate whether stopping of ICS will lead to increased number of moderate or severe exacerbations and mortality in patients with high blood eosinophils compared to low blood eosinophils.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Smoking and noxious particles results in irreversible damage to the lungs. Although eosinophilic airway inflammation is usually considered a feature of asthma, it has also been recently found to play an important role in COPD patients. Exacerbations play an important role in the progression of airflow limitation, deterioration of health status and increased mortality of COPD patients. Therefore, preventing exacerbations is one of the major goals in the treatment of the disease. Traditionally, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are prescribed to reduce exacerbations. However, ICS are associated with side effects and are ineffective in some patients. Patients with elevated eosinophil's are believe to benefit from ICS. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of withdrawal of ICS among COPD patients with varying blood eosinophilic inflammation on the risk of exacerbations, hospitalisation/accident & emergency visits and all-mortality. We will use Cox regression analysis to identify the risk of the acute exacerbation, hospitalisation and all-cause mortality adjusting for relevant confounders, among patients with different blood eosinophil levels.

Systematic new evidence from electronic health records,"It is known that infections are becoming more resistant to treatment by antibiotics (ABs). This could be because ABs are being prescribed too frequently. We need to make sure that ABs are only prescribed when they are really needed. We don't know what level of AB use in primary care is acceptable and safe. This research investigates the safety of reducing AB prescription in primary care, and to understand the impact of policies aimed at reducing AB prescribing.

We will then study primary care patient electronic health records to find out if the risk of each outcome is greater (or not) when ABs are not prescribed. We will also analyse Hospital Episode and mortality statistics. The data will be analysed in several different ways. We will look at it from an individual patient perspective and also across general practices. We want to identify those groups where risk of each infection complication is greatest. This will include sub-groups of age, gender, associated health conditions, and in very old people, according to their level of frailty using an established frailty measure.","Antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR) is a growing threat. Many antibiotic (AB) prescriptions in primary care are unnecessary and the NHS is now incentivising reduced AB prescribing in primary care.

We will systematically identify a comprehensive list of safety outcomes relevant to a policy to reduce overall AB utilisation in primary care. Case definitions will be developed. A cohort study will be conducted using electronic health records (EHRs) from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with linked hospital episode, mortality and deprivation data. At population- (general practice-) level, we will estimate the incidence of each safety outcome by level of AB prescribing. At individual-level, we will conduct a series of epidemiological studies to evaluate relative and absolute risks of safety outcomes, allowing for confounding by indication using appropriate epidemiological methods. We will obtain estimates for the primary care population stratified by age-group, gender, comorbidity status, smoking, deprivation and, in older adults, frailty level using e-Frailty index.","We will analyse as outcomes bacterial infections that might potentially be complications arising from a policy of reducing antibiotic prescriptions in primary care.

Schizophrenia is characterised by psychotic symptoms (disturbed thoughts, hallucinations, delusions) whereas bipolar disorder is associated with extremes of mood, from periods of extreme highs (mania) to periods of extreme low mood. People with SMI tend to experience poorer physical health and shorter life expectancy than the general population, and die 15-20 years earlier, usually from preventable physical conditions such as heart and lung disease. Research is needed to examine the impact of policies aimed at reducing the inequality. This study will use information from patients' health records to find out how we can better meet the physical health needs of people with SMI, so they can live longer, healthier lives. It will use anonymised patient data routinely recorded by general practitioners and hospitals, to investigate whether changes to national guidelines/ programmes that give clinicians financial incentives to monitor the physical health of patients e.g. the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)) affect care quality and health outcomes for people with SMI. Findings will shared with a variety of audiences, including people with lived experience, academics and health professionals.","People with serious mental illness (SMI) have reduced life expectancy and are at increased risk of comorbidities compared to the general population. Unmet physical health need is increasingly recognised as one of the factors underpinning the morbidity-mortality gap. Since its inception in 2004, the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) offered general practices in England incentives to conduct physical health checks on patients with SMI to address this inequality. In 2014, however, all indicators rewarding physical health checks were retired - with the exception of blood pressure. This project aims to examine the impact of incentives for physical checks on quality of care and health outcomes for SMI patients.

Data routinely collected from CPRD, linked to HES and ONS, and a technique called an Interrupted Time Series Analysis will be used to assess the impact of national guidelines and incentives on clinical activity in primary care, unplanned hospital admissions and deaths of SMI patients. Using this approach any change/trend in clinical activity, admissions and deaths due to the introduction and/or retirement of incentives will be identified. 
 
Findings will be disseminated to a wide range of audiences and used to inform policy recommendations on how to reduce the morbidity-mortality gap associated with SMI.","Admitted Patient Care

Individuals usually experience symptoms for years before being correctly diagnosed. This project aims to improve the recognition of BD through identifying earlier signs before diagnosis. We aim to examine the risk of development of adverse events and identify factors associated with delayed diagnosis.
Looking back at health records of people with BD, we will identify when the most frequently occurring health events were prior to BD diagnosis, such as depression, anxiety and antidepressant prescription. We will compare these health events with those occurring over the same time in individuals without BD. This will enable us to decide on events most likely to indicate the onset of BD and important earlier signs leading up to onset. A separate analysis using machine learning, which identifies patterns of events without prior knowledge of associated symptoms will also be adopted. To examine consequences of BD, we will look forward from diagnosis and calculate risk of developing adverse outcomes, including self-harm, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and premature death. In the BD individuals, calculating the time between onset and diagnosis will provide an estimate of delay so we may identify risk factors associated to short or long delay. We will examine the risks of developing subsequent disease and also premature death depending on the length of delay in diagnosis.","The study objectives are to improve early recognition of Bipolar Disorder (BD), examine major adverse outcomes as a consequence of BD and to examine risk factors for delayed diagnosis and the consequences of delay. Individuals with first diagnosis of BD, identified by Read codes between 1/1/2010 and 31/07/2017 in CPRD and eligible for IMD, HES and ONS-linkage will be extracted and matched on age, gender, practice and index date with unaffected control patients (ratio 1:20). Likely symptoms of onset and those earlier signs leading up to onset will be identified by investigating the incidence of each event of interest for each year prior to diagnosis from all contacts through primary and secondary care sources of individuals with and without BD. A separate analysis using machine learning, which identifies patterns of events without prior knowledge of associated symptoms will also be adopted. To handle the large number of event codes and with some codes very rarely used, semantic similarity and principal component analysis will be applied. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to identify clusters of patients exhibiting similar patterns will be implemented. Cox regression will be used to investigate whether individuals with BD have elevated morbidity and mortality risk.  By establishing the likely onset date of BD and calculating the probable diagnosis delay, multivariable regression models (linear or logistic regression) will be used to identify factors independently associated with diagnosis delay such as subsequent mental health diagnoses or substance abuse. We will also examine elevated risk between delayed diagnosis and subsequent morbidity and mortality outcome by using Cox regression analysis to obtain hazard ratios.","Bipolar disorder

Patients can experience breathlessness, have swollen ankles and feel tired however HF can be effectively treated with medication. 
In our previous work, using GP records from 1998 to 2012, we found that the length of time people lived for after a diagnosis of HF stayed the same over 15 years and did not improved over time. We want to look at more up to date data to see if this has changed. We want to find out how long people with HF are living for today and if this has got better in the past few years. 
We will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) - a large database that has millions of anonymous patient records - to look at the survival of people with HF. We will look at what percentage of people live for one, five and ten years after their diagnosis and if this has changed over the years. We will also examine the reasons why people with HF died. We hope this work will allow us to have a better understanding of HF in the community.","Heart failure (HF) is a common and costly condition affecting 1-2% of adults. The aim of this study is to determine the survival rates of people with HF, and if prognosis has improved over time.

An open matched retrospective cohort study, using data from CPRD for the period between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2017, will be conducted using records of people with and without a HF diagnosis. CPRD data will be linked to HES data to validate the code of HF and the Office for National Statistics death registration data to provide the date and cause of death. 

Kaplan-Meier curves will be used to compare the survival in patients with and without HF and by age group, gender and deprivation quintile. One, 5 and 10-year survival rates for HF cases will be calculated for each 10-year age band. For comparison, survival rates of patients without a diagnosis of HF will also be determined. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis will be undertaken to assess the effect of HF on survival with adjustment for age, gender and practice. To examine trends over time, survival rates will be calculated by year of diagnosis.","Mortality

However, it is believed that they may cause a sudden deterioration in kidney function (acute kidney injury - AKI), especially if taken during periods of illness like severe infections. In recent years there have been a number of initiatives to reduce the occurrence of AKI including advising clinicians to stop these drugs for patients with AKI. Anecdotally, this has meant that an increasing number of people are having their ACEI/ARB stopped. There is concern that this could lead to an increase in the number of people having deterioration in the conditions that these drugs are meant to prevent, such as worsening of heart failure or high blood pressure. In this study, among people who were admitted to hospital with AKI while taking ACEI or ARBs, we will examine the proportion who had the drugs represcribed after admission, and whether this is changing over time. We will compare the rates of subsequent admission with heart failure, AKI and stroke, between those who had the drugs stopped with a comparable group of people who continued the medications.","Due to concern about the association between ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and acute kidney injury (AKI), it is thought that a growing proportion of people are having their medication stopped. It is not known if the potential benefits of reducing future AKI risk from stopping ACEI/ARB outweigh an increased risk of admission from other causes. To address this, we will identify a cohort of users of ACEI/ARBs who are admitted to hospital with AKI. We will identify the proportion of these who are represcribed the drugs after admission and examine whether this is changing over time. We will describe total subsequent frequency of readmissions and length of hospital stay. Using poisson regression and adjusting for multiple confounders we will compare the rates of admission with: i) heart failure; ii) AKI; and iii) stroke, between those who do and do not restart an ACEI/ARB following first AKI admission. We will examine whether there is an interaction for the outcome between patients with and without a diagnosis of cardiac failure prior to the AKI admission.","Odds of continued prescription of an ACE Inhibitor or Angiotensin receptor blocker (primary descriptive outcome)

There is debate among IBD specialists, however, about how effective 5-ASA treatment really is and what types of patients most benefit from its use. We propose to study the routinely collected data on the use of 5-ASA in patients with Crohn's disease from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). During this process, we will select Crohn's disease patients being treated with a 5-ASA to assess how long they have been on the medicine, how they are performing on the medicine, and their use of healthcare resources/services (e.g. general practitioner visits, visits to the hospital, additional medication to help manage their condition etc.).

People affected by PD experience symptoms like shaking, slowness in movements and rigidity as well as mental and behavioural symptoms, which tend to increase with disease progression. A recent study has hypothesized that a drug that has been used for decades for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, namely salbutamol, may prevent the onset of PD. Based on this hypothesis, salbutamol and other similar drugs could be used to prevent the onset of PD and slow down its progression in patients already affected by the disease. We propose to test this hypothesis using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We will compare all patients with PD to similar individuals without PD. We will then determine how many of them took salbutamol and other similar respiratory drugs before the PD diagnosis. The findings of this study will help us better evaluate whether these drugs can reduce the risk of developing PD.","A recent study hypothesized that salbutamol, a beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2AR) agonist, might have a protective effect in the development of PD. To test this hypothesis, we will assemble a cohort of all individuals in the CPRD aged 50 or over between 1995 and 2016. We will exclude patients with PD or patients who were prescribed antiparkinsonian drugs before cohort entry and patients previously exposed to beta2AR agonists or beta antagonists before cohort entry. Within this cohort, all incident cases of PD will be matched to ten controls per case on age, sex, general practice, calendar year of cohort entry, and duration of follow-up. Conditional logistic regression will be used to estimate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals of PD associated with the ever use, cumulative duration of use, and cumulative dose of beta2AR agonists compared with no use. In all models, exposure to beta2AR agonists will be lagged by one year to take into account a biologically plausible latency time window. The same analyses will be repeated for exposure to beta-blockers. In addition to the matching variables, all models will be adjusted for potential confounders.

Nearly one million people in the United Kingdom have heart failure. These patients experience debilitating symptoms, frequent hospitalisations, and an increased risk of death because of this condition. 

Medical guidelines recommend several medications to relieve symptoms in patients with heart failure, avoid the need for hospitalisation, and help them to live longer. However, it is unclear if patients in the UK are given these medications in ways that maximise the possible benefits. We must therefore examine how many patients have an adequate supply of pills (enough for each day) and whether the doses they are given are appropriate. We must then determine the extent to which supply of pills and doses are related to better health outcomes. We will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics databases to complete this study. The results could be used to improve prescribing of heart failure medications in UK primary care and improve health outcomes for patients.","Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and a major financial burden on health systems. Current medical guidelines recommend use of several medications to help manage patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Studies have shown that the use of these medications in recommended doses improves survival, reduces hospital admissions, and can reduce health costs. However, it is unclear if patients in UK primary care receive adequate supplies of medications and whether target doses are being achieved. Patients may not receive or take medications correctly or at all, for various reasons related to the patient, the prescriber, or the healthcare system:
- they may not adhere to treatment, for example because of forgetfulness or adverse reactions;
- they may receive conflicting advice from carers;
- they may have limited access to health care, owing to geography or cost;
- repeat prescriptions may not be requested or issued.
However, before studying these factors in UK primary care we must first determine the extent to which interruptions in treatment occur and if they are associated with patient outcomes.

We shall therefore describe the proportion of patients with reduced ejection fractions experiencing interrupted treatment (days without pills) and determine the extent to which their prescribed doses meet guideline recommendations. We will then examine the association between interrupted treatment and prescribed dosage regimens and important patient outcomes (emergency hospital admissions and mortality) using Cox proportional hazards modelling adjusted for key co-variates. We will also examine if patient characteristics are associated with interrupted treatment and dosage regimens using Cox proportional hazards modelling and logistic regression. The results of this study could be used to inform quality improvement initiatives and improved management of patients with heart failure in UK primary care.","Primary:

We don't have much up-to-date information about how many people in the United Kingdom (UK) have amyloidosis. While the disease is rare, there is some evidence that the disease might be becoming more common as the years go by. The purpose of this study is to come up with a current estimate for how many amyloidosis patients there are in the UK.

Knowing this information will benefit the public by helping doctors know how many and what types of amyloidosis patients to expect today and in the future. Usually studies of this type only look at patients in hospitals, but not at a large group of citizens getting care from their regular doctor. Also, it will help raise awareness of the condition in the UK, and potentially lead to earlier treatment.","The amyloidoses refer to a group of rare disorders of protein folding characterized by extracellular tissue deposition of misfolded and aggregated autologous proteins as Beta-pleated sheet fibrils.

Symptoms are cough and breathlessness, with flare-ups during which symptoms become much worse. Many COPD patients already take statins for prevention of heart disease. Statins may have other beneficial uses as well as their main one to lower cholesterol. Some studies have found that statins might reduce the frequency and severity of COPD flare-ups, but a recent trial was stopped because there was no evidence of any benefit. These conflicting results may be because the trial only included patients with moderate-severe COPD and no pre-existing heart disease. Further, there may be problems with the design of some of the other studies. We will use data from the Clinical Practice Research datalink (CPRD) to investigate whether statins can reduce the severity and frequency of flare-ups.  We will define statin use carefully so as not to bias our study. We will investigate the effects of statin use overall, by severity of COPD, and by pre-existing heart disease. If our results suggest that statin use reduces number or severity of COPD flare-ups, then they can be used to justify and plan new trials of statins for COPD.","Statins are widely used for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a significant comorbidity in COPD. There is increasing evidence that COPD is a systemic inflammatory disease and that statins have anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, statins might reduce the severity/frequency of COPD exacerbations. Several observational studies have found statin use to be associated with lower exacerbation rates. However, a trial of simvastatin for preventing exacerbations was stopped early due to lack of benefit. It has been hypothesised that this was due to restriction of the trial population to people without CVD who would have lower levels of inflammation and therefore be least likely to benefit. Furthermore, the observational studies may have been subject to biases e.g. immortal-time or prevalent-user bias. 
Given the high burden of exacerbations to the NHS and to individuals, and that statins are inexpensive and widely accepted, the possibility of statins having a direct role in COPD management should be investigated further. We will design a historical cohort study using the CPRD. Our population will include different severities of COPD. We will use a new-user design with propensity score matching to minimise bias. Our results would be used to justify (or not) and design another trial, including selection of subgroups most likely to benefit.","- Primary outcome: Time to first exacerbation and exacerbation rate.

As such, there is demand for interventions that can prevent both the disease and disease complications.

However, it is not clear that achievement of the particular clinical targets incentivised through QOF, or the care processes reviewed in the National Diabetes Audit, leads to improvements in key outcomes such as emergency hospital admissions and mortality, which carry high human and financial cost.

Preliminary studies suggest this is also the case for antipsychotic drugs. These are drugs designed to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia; however, there is evidence suggesting they are increasingly prescribed for other uses in children such as challenging behaviour. These medications have numerous side effects including weight gain and drowsiness, of which children are at greater risk. We have little understanding about which children are prescribed these medications and for what purpose.  There is also limited evidence about their safety in children leading to controversy about whether this increase in prescriptions is appropriate. 

This study will analyse the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD) which contains data from patients registered with General Practices, representing 6.9% of the UK population. We aim to examine rates of antipsychotic prescribing in children between 2000 and 2017 and the factors associated with this, such as age, gender and social deprivation level. This will provide vital information to help understand the reasons for any changes in the rates in antipsychotic prescribing and which children are affected by this. This information could help develop guidelines to protect their safety.","Evidence suggests that the rate of prescribing of psychotropic medication has increased among children and adolescents across Europe and the US since the 1990s; and that this pattern has also been seen with antipsychotics. However, we have limited data about trends in UK antipsychotic prescribing in children within the last five years; and we also have a limited understanding of the factors associated with these prescriptions. 

This exploratory cohort study will use CPRD-Gold data to examine changes in antipsychotic prescription rates in 3 to 17 year olds from 2000 to 2017. It will examine the overall prevalence of antipsychotic prescribing amongst children and the rate of first antipsychotic prescriptions each year. Read codes for psychosis and other indications for antipsychotics will be identified and temporally linked to first antipsychotic prescriptions. We shall then examine changes in the rates of first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) vs. second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and in individual SGAs. We shall also investigate changes in indications for these prescriptions over time and changes in rates of prescriptions in different ages, genders and socio-economic status.","Changes in rates of antipsychotic prescriptions in children over time, measured by yearly incidence	 of prescriptions from 2000-2017

At one time, the stronger opioids, such as morphine, were used mainly to relieve moderate to severe pain that was either short-term or associated with cancer, but there is evidence that doctors are now prescribing opioids more frequently for long-term, non-cancer pain. However, opioids can have unpleasant side effects such as nausea and constipation, which can impair the patient's quality of life and make care and pain relief more difficult. The purpose of our study is to describe how, over time, patients have been treated with opioids - for how long, in what combination and for what reason; how often side effects occur and how these are managed; patients' use of healthcare services while being prescribed opioids; and circumstances associated with higher usage and costs. This will provide valuable information about trends in the use of prescribed opioids in the UK and the effects of these trends and of different patient characteristics and treatment experiences on healthcare burden.","Recent years have seen a significant increase in opioid prescribing in the UK and elsewhere, with consequent concerns about healthcare burden. We wish to profile the prescribing of weak and strong opioids in UK primary care 1998-2016 and to examine the impact of treatment patterns, indications and adverse events on healthcare resource use and associated cost. Episodes of opioid treatment will be identified from prescription data and characterized by their indications, component opioid class(es), duration, medical possession ratio, number of treatment changes, adverse events commonly associated with opioids, and the stability of the treatments for those adverse events. We will report the annual incidence and prevalence of opioid therapy and calculate the frequency and associated costs of healthcare use in the course of the episode, comparing these with usage and costs in the 12 months prior to initiation using the Wilcoxon signed-rank testPoisson regression models, and stratifying the results by the episode characteristics described above. Main analyses will consider primary-care data from CPRD alone, with sensitivity analyses performed with the addition of linked inpatient and outpatient data in patients eligible for linkage.","- Treatment patterns of opioid therapy in primary care

Warfarin in Older People with Atrial Fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation makes the heart beat irregularly. One of the main risks of atrial fibrillation is that it increases the risk of stroke. There is good evidence that blood thinning medications reduce the risk of stroke, however, these medications can also increase the risk of bleeding. Warfarin was the only oral blood thinner available, but in the last 10 years, another four medications have entered the market and their use has increased rapidly. These new blood thinners are called direct oral anticoagulants or DOACs. Clinical trials have shown that DOACs are as effective as warfarin for preventing stroke and they may also be associated with a lower bleeding risk. However, older people, particularly those who have other illnesses such as dementia, were excluded from the trials so we are unsure whether the results can be applied to this group of people. The aim of this study is to look at how DOACs and warfarin are being prescribed to older people in the community and investigate whether the DOACs are as effective as warfarin for stroke prevention and as safe with respect to bleeding. This information will help prescribers to decide which type of blood thinner is most appropriate for older patients.","This study will describe the prescribing of oral anticoagulants to people over the age of 75 for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) and investigate whether the newly introduced direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are as effective and safe as warfarin, which has been used for decades. Initially an explorative study will be conducted to review whether the characteristics of older people prescribed anticoagulants have changed since the introduction of DOACs. Cohort studies will then be used to investigate serious outcomes including ischaemic stroke, bleeding (major and clinically relevant), intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, myocardial infarction and mortality. Two comparator warfarin groups (one contemporary and one historical) will be used to evaluate the effect of channelling. People prescribed DOACs will be matched by age, sex, GP practice and index year to people prescribed warfarin during the same period or during a historical period before DOACs became available. Time to diagnosis of these outcomes will be compared using survival analysis. Covariates including smoking, alcohol, BMI, comorbidities and co-prescribing will be adjusted for. Renal impairment, body-weight, frailty, falls, co-morbidities, and polypharmacy may influence the safety of DOACs in older people with AF. This will be investigated using the regression model.",Ischaemic stroke; Composite of all bleeding; Major bleeding; Gastrointestinal bleeding; Clinically significant non-major bleeding; Myocardial infarction; All-cause mortality; Intracranial haemorrhage.,"Dr Anita McGrogan - Chief Investigator - University of Bath

Nevertheless, kidney disease progression is not fully understood in T2DM as evidence has indicated that improvement of kidney function is also possible. Kidney function is often an important parameter when treatment decisions in T2DM are to be made, as only very few anti-diabetic treatments can be used safely in patients with kidney disease without requiring a dose adjustment. Using data from The Clinical Practice Research Datalink, this study aims to monitor kidney function in a cohort of T2DM patients over a period of 5 years to generate evidence on the evolution and patterns of kidney function over a long period of time. Evidence from this study can contribute in raising general practitioners' awareness of patterns of kidney function when treatment decisions in T2DM are to be made.","Renal disease is a common comorbidity in patients with Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and therefore renal function should be taken into consideration when medications are to be prescribed. Adopting a retrospective cohort study design, the aim of the study is to characterise T2DM patients' renal status and generate evidence on patterns of renal function evolution over time. In particular, a cohort of newly diagnosed T2DM patients will be followed up over time and for up to 5 years to examine a) eGFR trend b) counts and percentages of patients who have transitioned into a higher category of renal function compared to baseline, c) counts and percentages of patients who had been in a different eGFR category than the one assigned at baseline during follow up d) mean number of different eGFR categories a patient is assigned to over time d) counts and percentages of patients with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline who have their eGFR increased to eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 during follow up.","eGFR trend (mean, median, SD, min, max, IQR, 95% CI) over time; Counts and percentages of T2DM patients who have transitioned into a higher category of renal function compared to baseline over time; Counts and percentages of T2DM patients who have transitioned into a lower category of renal function compared to baseline over time.","Nafeesa Dhalwani - Chief Investigator - Evidera, Inc

This will be done by looking at which treatments patients are given and comparing this to recommendations from clinical experts in recognised guidelines. This information will then be graphed to create a picture of which order patients receive treatments and whether they follow a step-wise pattern. Asthma management is mostly based on a treatment add-on approach in which higher doses and higher numbers of drugs are prescribed as symptoms continue. Because of this, when treatments change they should follow a similar pattern. The study to be undertaken could help establish whether patient receive treatments in a similar way across the country. This would inform health care organisations as a whole and potentially specialist and general practitioners.","This study is a non-interventional cohort study using existing data provided by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), to gain a qualitative description of asthma prescribing patterns in the United Kingdom.

Among patients with cancer, there is a common perception that patients with T2D have a poorer survival than those without T2D. However, the studies reporting these findings have several major weaknesses. Additionally, no study to-date has analysed survival in individuals with and without T2D, and with and without cancer, to address the question 'do individuals with T2D and cancer have reduced survival over and above what would be expected by T2D and cancer acting separately?' This is referred to as a diabetes-cancer interaction.
To address this interaction, it is necessary to have a large dataset of information on patients with T2D linked with cancer diagnosis, and also linked with subsequent cause of death. We plan to bring together three linked datasets covering the period: 02/01/1998- 31/12/2015.
We will investigate the relationship between T2D and cancer, and its impact on survival. This will involve complex statistics.
The findings will inform the impact of diabetes on survival in patients with cancer, and facilitate updating clinical guidelines.","Studies report that patients with cancer and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have poorer survival than patients with cancer without T2D. These studies had major weaknesses (small sample sizes, biases, confounding), and importantly, no study tested the hypothesis that T2D adversely impacts on survival, over and above the independent negative effect of T2D on survival. We propose a novel study to evaluate the effect of T2D on survival in a matched non-cancer cohort; testing the interaction between cancer and T2D on survival.
Methods: We will delineate CPRD data extracts for individuals with incident cancer (02/01/1998- 31/12/2015) linked with NCRAS - cancer cohort - and matched (1: 5) by year of birth (Â±2 years), sex and general practice to derive a non-cancer cohort. Derived cohorts will be linked with ONS to determine cause of death. Within each cohort, we will stratify by pre-existing T2D.
Primary outcomes: Any cause death (cancer and non-cancer cohorts); cancer deaths in cancer cohorts
Secondary outcome: Cardiovascular deaths
Models: We will develop time-to-death models from cancer diagnosis or matched index date for the non-cancer cohort. A priori, we will stratify by gender; smoking status; IMD deprivation quintiles; and Charlson comorbidity index; and model competing risks of death.","Death from any cause

Thus, they could prevent the building of blood clots in vessels supplying the heart or the brain with blood. Therefore, they could decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. Moreover, some antidepressants have a stronger blood-thinning effect than others. Thus, they could be better at decreasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. However, no studies have answered this question yet. Therefore, this study will determine whether such antidepressants are related to a decreased risk of heart attack or stroke using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. To do so, we will study patients with heart attack or stroke among users of antidepressants. Then, we will compare the number of patients with heart attack or stroke who are taking antidepressants that strongly increase thinning of blood to the number of patients who are taking antidepressants that weakly reduce thinning of blood. The findings of this study will help us better evaluate the differences between various antidepressants.","Serotonin can enhance platelet aggregation and induce vasoconstriction. Antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce thrombocyte serotonin levels. Therefore, they may inhibit platelet activation and eventually decrease thrombotic risk. Moreover, this risk may vary with the degree of serotonin inhibition of the antidepressant. Previous studies addressing this question had methodological shortcomings or were focussed on single entities of thrombotic disease. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine whether the use of antidepressants strongly inhibiting serotonin reuptake is related to a decrease in the risk of ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. For this purpose, we will assemble a cohort of patients, at least 18 years of age, newly treated with antidepressants between January 1, 1995 and June 30, 2014.

The QOF is a scheme running since 2004 which financially rewards general practices for providing good quality of care to patients in a range of clinical areas (e.g. managing diabetes). Since the introduction of the QOF, some clinical indicators have been removed. It is important to understand what happens to quality of care when general practices are not paid anymore for delivering these activities. This is not only relevant for NHS England but it is of global interest, since similar programmes exist elsewhere in the world.

We will use CPRD data to evaluate what happens when clinical indicators (for example, one indicator refers to blood pressure management for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease) were removed from the QOF, and what that means for patients. We are interested in how these changes will affect different population groups (e.g. by older people, people in more deprived areas).  

The results from this work will shed light on the potential impacts these changes in the GP contract have on patients, and they will help us identify potential risks from the changing policy. This work is for NHS England, and our findings will aid their review of the QOF.","NHS England are currently conducting a review of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), a primary care financial incentivisation scheme that started in 2004. It is possible that some elements of the scheme may be removed and it is important to understand what happens to quality standards when such incentives are removed. One of the key areas for investigation is the potential impact of removing the incentives on the quality of care delivered in general practice. There is limited evidence on the effect of removing indicators from pay-for-performance schemes and what evidence is available is contradictory. 

By applying interrupted time series analysis to CPRD data (2006-2020), we will determine the effect of the retirement of QOF indicators on quality of care. To add to the literature that predominantly focuses on practice-level data, we will conduct patient-level analysis to consider heterogeneous effects by considering specific subpopulations and identify the distributional consequences of removing incentives.

Tramadol is a unique opioid drug that is increasingly used because it has a lower risk of addiction and abuse than other opioids. It decreases pain, in part, by increasing the body's serotonin levels. This process may increase or decrease the risk of having heart-related problems. With no high-quality studies examining the effect of tramadol on the risk of having heart problems, there is an urgent need to do so. We will answer this question in the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We will compare the chances of having heart problems between patients who use tramadol and those who use another opioid, codeine. The main outcome of our study will be heart attacks. Other outcomes will be chest pain, surgery to open blocked arteries in the heart, strokes, irregular heartbeats, excessive bleeding from blood clotting problems, blood clots in the vein, bleeding, and death. If we find that tramadol changes the risk of having heart problems, we will alert regulatory agencies, doctors, and patients to this risk or benefit. If not, our study will provide reassurance regarding the safety of this drug.","With increasing concerns about opioid abuse and opioid-related deaths, the use of tramadol, a weak opioid with a low potential for abuse, has increased dramatically. Its mechanism of action involves binding to the mu-opioid receptor and inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Because of its unique effect on serotonin, tramadol may lead to serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition linked to hypertension, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmia. Conversely, serotonin reuptake inhibitors commonly lower platelet serotonin levels, potentially conferring cardioprotective abilities to tramadol. To date, there have been only three observational studies examining the cardiovascular effects of tramadol, all of which had major limitations. For additional insight, we will conduct a retrospective, population-based cohort study. In the CPRD linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) databases, we will identify a study cohort of patients initiating tramadol or the active comparator codeine for non-cancer pain. Patients will be followed for myocardial infarction (MI; primary outcome), unstable angina, cardiac revascularization, major haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, arrhythmia, venous thromboembolism (VTE), bleeding, and death (cardiovascular, sudden death, and all-cause).

1616633501-2260,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=22,A retrospective observational study describing the health impact of SABA over-prescription and ICS under-prescription among asthma patients,"Around 5.4 million people are treated for asthma in the UK. Asthma is treated with inhaled medication; patients can use a 'reliever inhaler' for immediate symptom-relief, and/or a 'preventative inhaler' to prevent asthma symptoms occurring. All reliever inhalers in the UK contain a type of drug called a short acting beta-agonists (SABA). All preventative drug regimens should contain an inhaled steroid (ICS). Clinical guidelines inform how and when inhalers should be used; for example, a patient with mild asthma may only use SABA, or only use SABA and low dose ICS, but a patient with moderate disease may use SABA and high dose ICS (as well as other medications). The clinical guidelines specify that a patient should have optimal asthma control (no asthma symptoms) and that a sign that they do not is if they are using their SABA inhaler more than twice a week; if a patient is using SABA frequently, it is likely that they should be on a higher ICS doses. Therefore this study aims to, firstly, describe the SABA and ICS inhaler prescription patterns in the UK over the past decade, and secondly, the effect these inhalers on asthma health outcomes and asthma-related healthcare resource utilisation.

Finally, we will estimate the cost of SABA use in the UK from an economic and environmental perspective.  The economic burden for society in the UK is currently very high.  In addition to direct costs, there is also a high environmental impact regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  SABA inhaler over-use, and asthma related health-care utilisation due to exacerbations contribute to both and will be studied in order to better understand total costs incurred.","We will describe the UK's current asthma population in terms of its SABA and ICS prescriptions, and temporal patterns (dataset=all eligible current asthma patients in CPRD). Patients will be categorised according to their SABA and ICS use in terms of British asthma guidelines. We will describe the demographic characteristics, asthma-related characteristics, treatment patterns, and exacerbations by BTS/GINA step and prescription coverage of ICS prescriptions. We will use a cohort study design to compare the effects of different patterns of SABA prescriptions on health outcomes (main outcome=exacerbations; using Cox and negative binomial models),  healthcare resource utilisation (main outcome=GP visits; using Poisson or negative binomial models, depending on distribution) (dataset=all eligible current asthma patients in CPRD that are linked with HES-ONS, for exacerbations, or not linked for healthcare resource), and cost (financial and environmental; using negative binomial model in HES-linked data). SABA prescriptions will be the main exposure, derived from 12 months of prescription data before the study start, both as categorical and continuous. Models will be adjusted for multiple potential confounders, including ICS prescriptions. If the descriptive analysis shows patients change between exposure categories over time then this will be taken into account by censoring patients when they change exposure category, and in sensitivity analyses, by taking into account the time-varying exposures.",#NAME?,"Dr Ekaterina Maslova - Chief Investigator - Astra Zeneca Ltd - UK Headquarters

1616633496-2258,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=22,The association between continuity of primary care and mortality and emergency hospitalisation for older patients with complex multimorbidity,"Older patients with long-term diseases (like heart disease, diabetes and dementia) are an important group. Their health problems are usually more complex than those of other patients and they often need more care from GPs. They are also more likely to be admitted to hospital as emergency cases. This can be distressing for these patients and costly for the NHS. As the number of older patients with long-term diseases rises, finding ways to provide better care for them in general practice becomes more important. Making it easier for such patients to see a GP who knows them well (improving continuity of care) may help. Research in other countries suggests that older patients with many long-term conditions who mainly see a GP who knows them well have lower levels of emergency hospital admission. We will use data from CPRD to find out whether this is also true in England. We also aim to find out whether patients who have better continuity of care live longer, and the best way of measuring continuity of care from GP records. The study findings will help NHS policymakers decide how much to focus on improving continuity of care for older medically complex patients.","Relational continuity of care between patients and GPs is an important aspect of primary care provision. There are however concerns that such continuity has declined, and will continue to do so in coming years as a result of increased service demands and macro level trends in primary care workforce. A better understanding of the relationship between relational continuity and important healthcare outcomes can help practices, patients and policymakers make better decisions about how much to prioritise relational continuity over other priorities (such as extended access). Specifically, a better understanding of whether continuity of care is associated with lower healthcare utilisation and better outcomes for older patients with multiple morbidities will become increasingly important as this group increases in number in coming years. We aim to use anonymised data from primary care medical records to quantify the association between continuity of care and two primary outcomes: rates of emergency hospitalisation and all-cause mortality. Using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) we will conduct a retrospective cohort analysis to quantify the strength of association between continuity of care at baseline and subsequent rates of hospitalization and death, using proportional hazard models adjusted for likely confounders, with subgroup analysis conducted for older patients with complex multimorbidity.",All cause mortality (PRIMARY); Routine hospitalisation (SECONDARY); Emergency hospitalisation (PRIMARY); GP consultation rate (SECONDARY); Primary care antibiotic prescription rate(SECONDARY).,"Dr Anas El Turabi - Chief Investigator - University of Cambridge

1616633526-2271,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=22,Treatment patterns and burden of agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease in the UK,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the UK and symptoms can include memory loss and difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language. Over time, more symptoms develop and many people develop behaviours that seem out of character. These can include agitation (e.g. restlessness, pacing), depression, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations and sleep disturbances. Agitation is a common symptom; in nursing homes, over 50% of people with AD are estimated to experience agitation. 

Agitation and other behavioural symptoms are treated with antipsychotics (APs), medicines traditionally used to treat psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia. There is currently little information on how these medicines are used in treating the symptoms of AD. We propose to use routinely collected health information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to understand the use of APs for treatment of agitation in AD. We will determine patients with AD and describe and compare the use of AP among people with no behavioural symptoms, those with agitation and those with other behavioural symptoms. We will also describe changes over time in the use of APs (2004 to 2017). This information will help to understand the current clinical management of behavioural symptoms in AD.","Background: Antipsychotics (APs) are used in the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite newer atypical APs having improved safety profiles compared to older typical APs, severe adverse effects remain and there is a drive to reduce AP use in dementia. Evidence on AP use for NPS in patients with AD is lacking. 
Objectives: This study will describe the use and treatment patterns of APs for NPS, specifically agitation, a common symptom in patients with AD. 
Methods: People with AD will be identified between 1 April 2004 and 31 December 2017. 1) Prescribing rates and treatment patterns for different AP types will be described in two recent time windows (2017 and 2015-2017) for patients classified into NPS descriptive cohorts. 2) Changes over time will be assessed by describing rates and patterns in each calendar year of the study period. 3) Patient characteristics will be described and compared across NPS descriptive cohorts 4) Treatment patterns will be compared across NPS groups for the recent time window (2015-2017). 
Importance: This valuable up-to-date information, in a large number of people with AD, identified from a representative UK population, will help understand the current clinical management of dementia and NPS.","Number of patients prescribed antipsychotic (AP) therapy during each calendar year

It is treated with long-term medication and regular monitoring. However, the burden of arthritis is not fully understood and management guidelines are not always followed. This study will describe the burden of disease and changes in management for four forms of arthritis that affect the joints: gout, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis. It will describe:
1.	Time from symptoms to diagnosis, how common each condition is and how they are managed. For some conditions we know little about how many people in the UK are affected and what care they receive. We will describe the characteristics of people affected, complications and use of medicine and services.
2.	Use of older and newer, more effective and safer medicines. We will describe changes in medicine prescribing and side-effects over time. For example, gout, where crystals form in joints, can be treated with anti-inflammatories or a newer medicine, allopurinol, which has fewer side effects. 
3.	Quality of diagnosis and management. For example, monitoring patients at risk of inflammatory arthritis is recommended. We will describe the quality of care using key indicators (e.g. proportion of patients referred to a rheumatologist).","There is incomplete understanding of the burden of inflammatory musculoskeletal diseases and variation in management in terms of spatio-temporal and demographic factors. For example, English studies of ankylosing spondylitis have evaluated risk factors, comorbidities and the validity of diagnostic codes, but the incidence and prevalence of disease, sick-leave rate and pattern of resource-use and management in routine primary care is unknown and we will examine this. Where the distribution and burden of diseases such as psoriatic arthritis are better known, the quality of routine care remains largely unstudied. We will apply quality indicators for timely diagnosis and management to describe current practice and care quality. We will also examine spatio-temporal variation in relation to patient characteristics and local guidelines. Where quality has been measured there is great variance, for example the steadily increasing use of effective treatment with DMARDs for rheumatoid arthritis, compared to the consistently suboptimal use of ULTs for gout. We will assess spatio-temporal and patient-related prescribing patterns and adverse events among incident and prevalent cohorts and the impact of more effective therapy on prescribing rates for traditional therapy including NSAIDs. This will inform understanding of the burden and variation in management of musculoskeletal diseases.","- Routes to diagnosis: screening, referral, symptoms (fatigue, hyperuriceamia, stiffness, back pain, hip pain, joint pain, itchy rash, scalp rash) related auto-inflammatory diseases (achilles tendinitis / tendinopathy, plantar fasciitis, apical lung fibrosis, anterior uveitis, psoriasis)
- Prevalence and incidence of disease from 1998: rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis

The objective of the project is to describe the epidemiology (prevalence, incidence) of MSK consultations in a cohort of people with dementia compared to a matched cohort, and to investigate the longitudinal development pattern of pain consultations and pain treatments in the dementia cohort compared to a matched cohort.
Methods:
We will identify people with a diagnosis of dementia registered with general practices in the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) between 1997-2017. People with dementia will be compared to a year of birth, sex, and practice matched cohort with no evidence of dementia diagnosis.
Data Analysis:
A retrospective matched cohort design will be used to investigate the four aims of the project. Firstly, period prevalence and incidence rates of MSK pain consultations for the dementia cohort and matched cohort will be calculated and compared. In addition, the drug count and pattern of analgesic prescriptions will be explored for the dementia cohort compared to the matched cohort using regression analyses (multinomial and multiple). Finally, longitudinal analysis will be conducted from pre-to-post index date (dementia diagnosis or equivalent date for matched cohort) for both the dementia and matched cohorts to investigate MSK consultation frequency and analgesic prescription frequency using joinpoint regression.","Primary outcomes:

When part or all of that clot breaks off and travels to the lungs it can be life threatening. Blood thinners may decrease the risk of clots but also increase the risk of bleeding. Both blood clots and bleeding need medical attention, may require hospitalisation and have a higher risk of death. The aim of the current project is to identify risk factors for blood clots and of bleeding in patients with active breast, prostate, ovary, bowel and lung cancer. Knowledge about each individual's risk of clots and bleeding could help clinicians to assess which individuals might benefit from therapy with blood thinners.","This study aims to determine predictors for the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and separately for serious bleeding events in patients with one of the following five active cancer types: breast, prostate, ovary, colorectal and lung cancer. Active cancer will be defined as the 6 month period following a first cancer diagnosis, a subsequent diagnosis of cancer progression or cancer-specific therapy. The active cancer cohort will be stratified by the 5 cancer types and followed separately for the first occurrence of a clinical outcome of interest, either a VTE event or a serious bleeding event. Exposures of interest for each study outcome and for each cancer type are cancer-specific information (e.g. histology, stage and tumour size) and cancer-specific therapy (i.e. chemotherapy, cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and immunotherapy). Adjusted hazard rate ratios of the association between the exposures of interest and the clinical outcomes will be derived for each outcome and for each cancer type from multivariate Cox regression models. Estimates will be adjusted for co-morbidities, co-medications, patient demographics and lifestyle factors.",Venous thromboembolism; Serious bleeding.,"Dr Carlos Martinez - Chief Investigator - Institute for Epidemiology, Statistics and Informatics GmbH (Pharma Epi)

Before 2011, NICE told doctors to diagnose high blood pressure by taking repeat measurements of blood pressure during clinic appointments. In 2011, NICE guidance changed and doctors were told to diagnose high blood pressure based on blood pressure measurements taken by patients themselves at home. This change aimed to better target treatment on people most likely to benefit in terms of reducing heart attacks and strokes. However, critics said it would lead to fewer diagnoses and be dangerous to patients. We will study data from GP surgeries and hospitals in England before and after the guidelines change in 2011. We will study how the number of people diagnosed with high blood pressure has changed and whether this has had an effect on the number heart attacks and strokes. We will also look at changes in how blood pressure is measured (at home or during usual appointments), GP workload the number of blood pressure drugs prescribed. Results from this study will show if the change in guidance may have resulted in patient harm and will inform the next update to guidance in 2019.","Background and Aims: in 2011, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended the routine use of ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring for the diagnosis of hypertension along with changes in recommendations for anti-hypertensives. These changes were predicted to be cost-effective but opponents suggested they would lead to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We aim to assess the impact of the change in NICE recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension on the epidemiology, monitoring, treatment, and primary care workload of hypertension and possible impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Methods: Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and ONS mortality data will be used to assess changes related to the diagnosis of hypertension in the English population from 2006 to 2011 and 2012 to 2017, using an interrupted time series methodology. Changes over time in the incidence of hypertension as coded in the primary care record will be the primary outcome; secondary outcomes will be changes in the use of out-of-office blood pressure monitoring, the prescription of antihypertensive medication, General Practice workload associated with blood pressure monitoring and hypertension, and changes in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as all-cause mortality.",Incidence of hypertension (primary); New prescriptions of antihypertensive medication; Rate of out-of-office blood pressure monitoring; General practice workload associated with hypertension; Incidence of primary cardiovascular events; Cardiovascular mortality; All-cause mortality.,"Professor Richard McManus - Chief Investigator - University of Oxford

Clinicians and government agencies use this information to complement evidence from clinical trials to evaluate the benefits of different treatment options. Routine data are not collected primarily for research purposes, and hence the investigator has no control over the way patients are allocated to different treatment groups. In these settings, one approach that can help ensure that different groups of patients are comparable is to allocate patients according to a risk factor threshold. For example, anti-hypertensive drugs may be only given to patients whose blood pressure exceeds a certain level. Patients whose blood pressure is just below or above that level are expected to have similar characteristics, but may receive a different treatment. As a result, any differences in health outcome (e.g. mortality) between the treatment groups can be directly attributed to differences in treatment (anti-hypertensive drug). This study approach, known as 'regression discontinuity (RD) design', has received little attention in clinical research. This study aims to develop appropriate guidance for the use of RD designs to study the effects of medical treatments on patients' health. By doing this, we seek to clarify in which circumstances RD designs can be credibly used in clinical research.","Routinely-collected data are increasingly used to complement trial-based evidence for evaluating treatment effects of health interventions. The regression discontinuity (RD) design has been identified as a key tool for drawing causal inferences in such settings. While the number of applications of RD designs for studying the effects of health interventions is increasing, appropriate diagnostic tests for investigating the validity of RD designs in clinical settings have received little attention. In addition, statistical methods currently used in practice for the estimation of causal effects and corresponding uncertainty measures are sub-standard. This study will devise methodological guidelines for the use regression discontinuity designs to estimate treatment effects from routinely-collected data. Firstly, drawing on insights from the econometric literature, we will propose appropriate diagnostics tests to help assess whether a specific RD design is applicable. Secondly, we will investigate the required sample sizes for power analyses as a function of bandwidth estimates. Thirdly, we will critically assess alternative estimation approaches, including bandwidth estimation, for drawing causal inferences in RD designs. We will illustrate the methods in a study of the effects of statins on a wide range of outcomes, such as LDL cholesterol level, mortality and health care costs, using CPRD linked data. We will consider statin initiation as a function of cardiovascular disease risk score according to NICE clinical guidelines ('treatment rules') for the UK.","Mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular-related, identified through ONS data); LDL cholesterol (identified from CPRD); Hospital admissions/length-of-stay (HES inpatient data); Cardiovascular events (identified from CPRD/HES diagnoses).","Dr Luke Keele - Chief Investigator - Georgetown University

We propose to study the current use of ulipristal i using routinely collected health information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We will use anonymised data that is routinely collected by general practitioners. The results will help us to understand the target population and treatment patterns in a large and well-characterised sample of women.
The results of our study are expected to help ascertain a better understanding of current healthcare resource utilisation in women with symptomatic UF.","Background
Bayer is developing a new selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM), Vilaprisan, for long-term pharmacological UF treatment. To prepare access and health-economic evidence, a detailed description of the ulipristal target population and treatment pathways in a large and well-characterized sample of women are needed.

Objectives
This population-based descriptive study will characterize first-time users of ulipristal and utilisation patterns including switching to other medications and invasive gynaecological treatments following ulipristal treatment 

Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study with prospective data collection, designed to assess the characteristics of women and patterns of drug utilization in new users of ulipristal  in the UK.  Data will be obtained by merging the The Health Improvement Network (THIN) and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), with the latter supplemented by data from HES database. The enrolment period will be from January 1, 2012 (year ulipristal became available in the UK) to April 30, 2017 (THIN) and the latest available version of CPRD. All women with at least one prescription of ulipristal  during the study period will be included.
Data analysis
The study is of descriptive nature. The analyses will be conducted using standard summary statistics such as means and proportions; continuous data will be presented as means with standard deviation (SD) and as medians with inter quartile range (IQR, min and max) when appropriate; categorical variables will be presented as counts (n) and proportions (%). Missing data will not be imputed. Survival analyses will be used for time-to-event outcomes (e.g. time to invasive gynaecological treatments after the last ulipristal course, time to pregnancy, etc.); women will be censored at the date of last practice data collection. The analyses will be performed for the total and sub-cohorts with respective number of ulipristal courses (i.e. women with 1, 2, 3, and 4 courses during the study period). The alternative sub-cohort's cuts may be considered after a review of ulipristal treatment pattern.
The details on reporting and analysis of individual outcomes (incl. subgroups, handling of competing risk/events in survival analysis) will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

As the liver becomes more diseased scaring forms within it (fibrosis) and this is termed advanced liver disease. We intend to look at the potential of using blood test indicators of advanced liver disease as screening in primary care in the UK.

Firstly, we plan to use general practice data (CPRD) to determine how using different blood test indicators of advanced liver disease (fibrosis) as a screening tool would affect NHS health services. We will work out how many people would need to be referred to see a hospital consultant as a result of the screening test.

Secondly, we plan to look and see how many people who we know end up in hospital with advanced liver disease and its complications (such as liver cancer) would have been identified earlier if we used the possible blood test indicators of advanced liver disease (fibrosis) as a screening test. 

The results will help us decide if and how to screen for advanced liver disease in general practice and will guide the future health care of patients.","Overall aim: 
To investigate the potential burden on UK health services of screening for chronic liver disease in UK primary care.
Methodology: 
We will conduct a population based cohort study to examine firstly the prevalence of probable hepatic fibrosis as determined by non-invasive markers, and secondly rates of liver cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation.
We will extract all patients with the necessary measures available to determine the prevalence of hepatic fibrosis and will phenotype them using non-invasive markers (AST/ALT ratio, APRI, FIB4, NAFLD Fibrosis Score). The components of each marker will be extracted as laboratory measures or READ codes from the linked clinical file and the composite score calculated. 
Hepatic decompensation will be defined as a composite outcome including liver cirrhosis, oesophageal varices, hepatocellular cancer and ascites.
Ability of each of the markers to predict hepatic decompensation will be determined separately using Cox proportional hazards regression and net benefit analyses for diagnostic test prediction models (as described by Vickers et al  BMJ 2016;352:i6).

DESIGN/METHODS: We will use anonymised GP and hospital records to study these associations. According to figures provided by CPRD, >10,900 patients undergoing bariatric surgery for obesity are available. To avoid the biases mentioned above we will use advanced methods applied in vaccine safety studies (called 'self-controlled case series'), where the risk of fracture in the periods before and after surgery are compared for each patient.

Schizophrenia is treated with drugs called 'antipsychotics'. Taking more than one antipsychotic over a long time can make these physical illnesses more likely although at present we do not have firm evidence about this. We want to find out whether taking more than one antipsychotic drug increases the chance of a person getting one of these serious physical illnesses. In this study, we would like to use GP practice data to answer this. We will obtain data on a large group of people with schizophrenia who are prescribed one or more than one antipsychotic drug. We will then follow them for up to 15 years to find out whether they are diagnosed with one of these illnesses. We will also try to find out if higher doses or certain combinations of antipsychotics are particularly harmful. 

Answering these questions can help reduce:
- Harms caused by drugs
- Risks of serious illnesses in schizophrenia patients 
- Costs due to unnecessary and potentially harmful prescriptions","People with schizophrenia are more likely to suffer from serious physical conditions i.e. diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. This study aims to investigate the prospective association between antipsychotic polypharmacy and diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and to investigate the mechanism of any association.

Previous studies have shown that there is a potential problem if sacubitril/valsartan is taken simultaneously with another drug group called statins which are used to lower blood cholesterol levels. If patients take both drugs there may be a risk that statins cause more adverse drug effects than if patients only take statins. The adverse drug effects feared most with this drug combination are destruction of muscles and/or liver cells, and acute inflammation of the pancreas (a gland that secretes digestive enzymes and certain hormones). As sacubitril/valsartan has only been on the market since December 2015 in the U.K., and as it is expected that it is often prescribed concomitantly with statins, it is necessary that the potential risk of concomitant use of sacubitril/valsartan and statins is further studied. This study aims to investigate whether U.K. patients who simultaneously use sacubitril/valsartan and statins are at a higher risk of the above described adverse effects than patients who only use statins.","Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel treatment for adult patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Sacubitril inhibits organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters in vitro. Based on this finding, drug-drug interaction studies have been performed between sacubitril/valsartan and atorvastatin or simvastatin (substrates of these transporters). Sacubitril/valsartan increased the maximal plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its metabolites by up to 2-fold, but did not increase the areas under the curve of atorvastatin and its metabolites. Sacubitril/valsartan had no clinically significant impact on exposures of simvastatin and its active metabolite. Given the high proportion of patients expected to be on a concomitant therapy with sacubitril/valsartan and statins, the market authorization holder of sacubitril/valsartan aims to further evaluate in the post-marketing setting this potential drug-drug interaction that may increase the risk of statin-associated myotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, or acute pancreatitis. This case-control study aims to assess the risk of myotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and acute pancreatitis in association with concomitant use of statins and sacubitril/valsartan, compared with use of statins without sacubitril/valsartan, in adult patients with heart failure.

In addition to being a source of significant distress to women, they are among the most common reasons for hysterectomy, though it causes infertility in women of reproductive age.
Ulipristal acetate (UPA) has been approved in Europe for treatment preceding a surgery for UF patients experiencing symptoms (in two three-month treatment cycles) and for repeated sequential treatment for UF patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms. Limited data exist on the use of currently available treatments for UF in the UK, in particular since the introduction of UPA.
This study is a retrospective longitudinal cohort study using UK primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to inpatient (Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)) data. The main aim of the study is to explore patient characteristics, care management and associated healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) in adult women for new episodes of UF.
Results from this exploratory research will provide an up-to-date picture of the current practice in the management of UF within GPs' practices in the UK.","Female patients aged 18-54 years old will be identified (indexed) on their first UF-coded event. 
As we want to capture treatment patterns for new episodes of UF, a pre-index period of 12 months with no UF-coded events is required. A 12-month pre-index window gives us a reasonable degree of confidence that the index date is in fact a new episode of UF.
Treatment patterns will be investigated within the 24 months post index date. Baseline characteristic will be assessed in the pre-index period and values closest to the index date will be used.
To assess the use of UPA, the study design will be modified to capture more patients prescribed UPA; the indexing period will be extended by 12 months to 36 months, and the follow-up period reduced from 24 months to 12 months. 
The study will be mainly descriptive, with elements of comparative analysis between UPA vs. non-UPA patients who received other pharmaceutical treatments. Negative binomial regression models will be constructed, with elements of HCRU as the outcome, UPA vs. non-UPA as the exposure and adjusting for confounding factors outlined in section M.

1616633455-2241,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=23,Outcomes following empirical antibiotic treatment of suspected urinary tract infection in older people in primary care.,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs), also known as 'bladder infections' or 'cystitis', are a common cause of illness in older people. Older people with symptoms of a UTI usually see their GP and may need antibiotics. Although some GPs wait for results of a urine test (48-72 hours) before prescribing antibiotics, most will prescribe at the initial consultation based on presenting signs and symptoms. Little is known about the rates of adverse outcomes in older people managed in this way, for example, rates receiving an alternative antibiotic because of persisting symptoms, of hospitalisation for serious infection, or of sudden worsening of kidney function. There is a need for research that estimates the risk of these outcomes for different antibiotics and different durations of treatment, to help GPs make informed decisions around immediate antibiotic treatment of suspected UTI. Immediate prescribing of the most appropriate antibiotic, for the most appropriate duration may reduce risk of adverse outcomes, particularly in high-risk patients, like those with underlying kidney disease. Therefore, this research will assess outcomes for older people prescribed immediate antibiotics for suspected UTI and compare outcomes for different antibiotics, different durations, and in patients with kidney disease.","Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common cause of morbidity in older people. Most older people with a suspected UTI consult their GP and may receive a prescription for empirical antibiotics. Little is known about rates of adverse outcomes following this approach, nor about associations between different empirical antibiotic prescribing strategies and outcomes, especially in higher risk groups, e.g., those with impaired renal function. There is also uncertainty around the optimal duration of treatment in this population, with limited evidence for the current practice of three-day therapy in women and seven-day therapy in men. This study will address these evidence gaps using linked CPRD GOLD, HES admitted patient care, and ONS death registry data. We will compare outcomes for different antibiotic prescribing strategies in patients aged >65 empirically treated for suspected UTI in primary care, and estimate risks of adverse outcomes according to renal function. We will explore potential predictors of early serious adverse outcomes. We will use multivariable logistic regression and propensity score-matching methods to estimate risk ratios and adjust for a range of confounding variables. Our research will inform clinical practice by providing evidence for appropriate empirical antibiotic prescribing for older people presenting to primary care with suspected UTI.",Primary care re-consultation; Hospitalisation for pyelonephritis; Death; Primary care antibiotic prescription; Hospitalisation for sepsis; UTI related hospitalisation; Hospitalisation for acute kidney injury.,"Dr Haroon Ahmed - Chief Investigator - Cardiff University

The World Health Organization estimates that 40% of adults have hypertension and that 13% of all deaths worldwide are caused by high blood pressure. Using medication to lower high blood pressure reduces the chances of a person with hypertension going on to develop the serious illnesses mentioned above. One commonly used type of blood pressure lowering medications is diuretics (or water tablets). We know that these work to lower blood pressure but we do not know which type of diuretic is best at preventing the serious illnesses associated with hypertension. We will use the CPRD database to identify the large number of patients already being treated with diuretics and followed for up to 30 years. We will compare the effectiveness of one diuretic drug, called indapamide, to another, called bendroflumethiazide, in reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and death. This will provide evidence to help doctors and patients decide which diuretic to use in the treatment of high blood pressure.","This study aims to compare the effects of prescribing indapamide, a thiazide-like diuretic, with bendroflumethiazide, a thiazide diuretic, as the first-line choice of diuretic in the treatment of hypertension. The outcome measure will be a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, acute decompensated heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes. We will identify in CPRD all patients aged 18 years and over with first diagnosis of hypertension after 1987. Among them, we will form two groups with first ever prescription of indapamide or bendroflumethiazide. We will follow the groups either to the date of last prescription, date of medication switch, date of additional medication for hypertension (such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, alpha-blockers, ARBs or other antihypertensive medication), date of outcome, date of de-registration with the medical practice or the date of last practice data collection. We will also extract information on patient age, sex, medical practice, co-morbidities, co-prescribed medication, smoking, weight and alcohol consumption. Incidence of event rates will be calculated in each group. Descriptive analysis, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression survival models will be used as appropriate. Subgroup analyses will be implemented for known risk factors. This large population-based study may provide new evidence on the potential benefit of treating hypertensive patients with indapamide or bendroflumethiazide and may inform future clinical trials.","- acute decompensated heart failure

Less clear is the role of NSAIDs in the occurrence of nephrotic syndrome (NS). This syndrome is characterized by protein loss in urine, a lower level of proteins in blood and the formation of oedema (fluid accumulation under the skin and around organs). A possible relation between NSAIDs and NS has been suggested in several case reports but a systematic study has not been performed. Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate the association between NSAIDs use and the risk of NS in a population-based study. Furthermore, when there is an association, it will be evaluated whether there are patient groups extra vulnerable for this side effect.","We aim to evaluate the association between NSAIDs and the risk of NS by conducting a case-control study in CPRD. Cases will be patients with a first diagnosis of NS (index-date), while controls will be those without a diagnosis of NS prior to the index-date. Each case will be matched to up to 3 controls by age, sex, practice, and the index-date. Exposure of interest will be NSAID use directly prior or at the index-date. Patients who were not using any NSAIDs prior to the index-date will be categorized as nonusers. Potential confounders taken into account will be comorbidities, co-medications, body mass index (BMI), and lifestyle. The strength of the association between NSAID use and NS will be estimated using conditional logistic regression model with different adjustment models, i.e. 1) no adjustment, 2) adjusted for comorbidities that are known to be associated with NS, 3) additionally adjusted for other potential confounders associated with renal toxicity, and 4) additionally adjusted for BMI and lifestyle factors (full model). Duration of NSAID use in relation to NS will also be studied.

ACOS has recently been described and just as the basic definitions of asthma and COPD are sometimes debated, the primary definition of ACOS is not yet clear, however, patients with ACOS consume more and higher doses of medications. One type of medicine, called bronchodilators, open the airways in the lung and are recommended by expert guidelines for the treatment and management of both asthma and COPD. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the risk of effects of the use of high doses of bronchodilators on the heart and lungs. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to use routinely collected health information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to identify patients who have developed new heart and lung illness and compare their medication use with otherwise similar people who do not develop heart and lung illness to see whether it is a side effect of using large amounts of bronchodilator medications.","To date, there are no published observational studies which have examined the association between Beta2-agonist medications and the risk of Cardio-Respiratory (CR) events in patients with Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome, ACOS. To address these limitations and knowledge gap, this research proposes to use an existing database of detailed healthcare records of new-users of bronchodilator medications for patients with physician diagnosed asthma and COPD. In particular, the impact of CR outcomes /events which include all-cause-mortality, pneumonia and major adverse cardiovascular events (including non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, heart failure (HF), arrhythmia or cardiovascular mortality) in patient with ACOS would be assessed and the results from this proposed study will represent the first and novel findings.","Outcomes: Our primary endpoints of interest are 1) all-cause mortality 2) pneumonia and 3) major adverse cardiovascular events. Pneumonia and major adverse cardiovascular events will consist of a diagnosis recorded in the GOLD data or HES data. Since mortality outcomes are only available in the subcohort data linked to ONS (death certificate), we will use this linked subcohort to assess cause-specific mortality for pneumonia and cardiovascular mortality. Major adverse cardiovascular events will be defined as the first occurrence of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, heart failure, arrhythmia or any cardiovascular-related mortality. Outcome assessment of cardiovascular-related admissions and mortality will be based on READ codes contained in the GOLD data linked to the sub-cohort of ICD-10 codes in the HES/ONS data (see Appendix D for codes). These outcomes definition were based on validated READ codes in the CPRD data and ICD-10 codes in the HES or ONS linkage data.[48-50].

1616633423-2228,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=24,Partner bereavement and subsequent diagnosis of specific skin diseases,"Psychological factors, such as stress, are widely believed to play an important role in the onset of specific, common and important skin diseases, including psoriasis (a scaly rash), eczema, vitiligo (white patches), melanoma skin cancer, alopecia areata (spot baldness) and urticaria (hives). These skin diseases pose a major burden in European countries, and three of them are amongst the top five skin disorders in terms of disability-adjusted life years. Nevertheless, there are few high-quality studies on the importance of stress in the onset of these disorders. This lack of evidence may be explained by the difficulty in measuring stress in epidemiological studies, as the types of life events that are perceived as stressful are very individual. In this health research study, we are interested specifically in stress associated with bereavement of a partner, as it likely to affect most persons negatively regardless of coping mechanisms. We will use data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to compare the risk of each aforementioned six skin diseases among persons who have lost their partner with the risk among persons who have not lost their partner. For melanoma, we will also examine if bereaved persons have a poorer survival than non-bereaved persons.","We will use a matched cohort study to examine if bereavement is associated with the onset of psoriasis, atopic eczema, vitiligo, melanoma, alopecia areata or urticaria. Partners will be defined as two persons with (1) the same family number, (2) opposite sex, (3) an age gap of 10 years or less and (4) no younger adult in the household within 15 years of either of the couple. We will then identify all deaths occurring in the couples during 1997-2014 and the bereaved partner will be classified as bereaved/exposed. The date of bereavement will be considered the index date. Next, we will randomly match five persons to each exposed person by age, sex and general practice. Persons in the matched cohort have to be alive and have a partner but without ever experiencing previous partner bereavement on the index date for the matched exposed person. Using stratified Cox regression, we will compute hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the association between bereavement and each outcome. We will examine if associations depend on risk of partner death (as measured by the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index) and time since bereavement.

COPD can lead to long lasting breathing problems and even death. One of the main causes of this disease is smoking cigarettes, but the start of COPD can also be caused by other factors, such as dust. There is no cure for this disease, but symptoms (difficulty breathing) can be managed with treatment. Medicines that are inhaled are used to reduce symptoms, improve health status and exercise capacity. Moreover, inhaled medications for COPD reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations and thus may decelerate the progression of lung function loss. However, inhaled medications are not effective in all patients and patients may develop side effects despite clinical benefit. We would like to be able to determine the people who will benefit from treatment. Biomarkers that may be useful to determine which patients would benefit such as 'eosinophils' and 'creatine reactive protein (CRP)' can be identified following a simple blood test. People with high levels of these factors in their blood may benefit more from inhaled medicines. This study will aim to see if these biomarkers (eosinophil's and CRP) can help determine which people using inhaled corticosteroid (ICS; a common medication for COPD), will have clinical benefit.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a medical condition characterized by enhanced airway inflammation, and is known to be responsible for mortality and morbidity of millions of individuals worldwide. Recent findings suggest that eosinophils have a key role in the disease pathophysiology. C-reactive protein have also been identified to be elevated in patients with COPD exacerbation. Exacerbations of COPD are the primary outcome as these greatly affect a patient's quality of life. The benefits of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to reduce exacerbations have mainly been observed in patients having eosinophil airways inflammation. Similarly, some benefits of ICS have been reported in patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore the use of ICS and the risk of acute exacerbations, hospitalisations and all-cause mortality among COPD patient with elevated levels of eosinophil (>0.34 x 109 cells/L) and CRP (>3 mg/L).

Patients with at least one blood eosinophil and CRP measurement at baseline will be included in the study. The primary outcome of the study will be a COPD acute exacerbation (secondary outcomes include: COPD-related hospitalizations or death). We will evaluate the risk of study outcomes stratified by ICS exposure, sex, and age category. Current ICS users will be stratified absolute blood eosinophil count and C-reactive protein using Cox regression analysis (SAS 9.4). We will also adjust for never, past and recent ICS use among current users stratified by eosinophil counts, CRP, gender and age categories for all outcomes.

Seizures are bursts of electrical activity in the brain that temporarily affect how it works. They can cause a wide range of symptoms.

Different types of epilepsy are often treated with anti-seizure medications, such as sodium valproate. There are many forms of medications available, including tablets, capsules, and even ""modified release"" forms which can delay the release of a drug into the bloodstream.

The form of the medication may influence whether or not patients, especially young children will take them according to how they should be taken, which is a concept known as adherence. Adherence is important because taking too few medications may allow seizures to recur, while taking too much medication may lead to toxic effects. 

The primary aim of this study is to look at how different epilepsy medications, and their forms, would influence adherence. We plan to perform this study in primary care general practitioner practices (i.e. GP practices) where prescription data is available. We will compare Episenta and Epilim Chrono, which both contain sodium valproate but in different forms. We will be comparing the proportion of days patients were actually on the drug (i.e. Proportion of Days Covered, or PDC) for each form, which is a common way to measure adherence. The PDC will be measured by the number of days covered by the drug divided by the number of days in between repeat prescriptions. Other measures of adherence will also be performed. 

We will also be comparing how many admissions to hospital these patients have, as well as outpatient appointments, accident & emergency attendances, and other interactions with healthcare services. This will help us to determine whether the form of epilepsy medication will influence these outcomes.","The primary objective of this study is to describe the persistence and adherence to modified release formulations of sodium valproate for the treatment of epilepsy and their clinical and resource use implications, for two alternative forms of oral CR valproate (Episenta and Epilim Chrono). Treatment adherence will be measured by Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) and Medication Possession Ratio (MPR).

CR valproate-naive adult and paediatric (under 18 years) sub-groups of patients with diagnosed epilepsy will be assigned cohort membership based on their first-ever exposure to either Episenta formulations (minitablets in either capsules or sachets) or Epilim Chrono monolithic tablets.  The cohorts will be randomly matched according to age group; and propensity score using parsimonious matching (no recycling) and a caliper of 0.1 in a ratio of 1 to 4 respectively.  The primary endpoint will be proportion of patients achieving high adherence as determined by PDC>0.8.  The margin of non-inferiority is empirically set as -0.1 (a 10% difference in proportion).  If non-inferiority is met, a superiority hypothesis will be alternatively tested.

The combined cohorts will also be used to explore the association between measures of anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment adherence and the outcomes of seizure frequency and healthcare resource use using UK linked primary care and Hospital Episode Statistics records to maximise case ascertainment.

The choice of valproate as a reference for the study is primarily because it is the first line treatment for most seizure types and syndromes according to NICE guidelines, particularly for children and young adults. These guidelines have made sodium valproate one of the most commonly used agents in the country for epilepsy in that population, serving as a good reference for AED treatment modifications.","A.

While hospital data on patients cannot be used to determine the specific brand type of medical device, information on patients undergoing surgical procedures is collected, offering some potential for devices monitoring. The overall aim of this study is to explore the value of using CPRD data from general practice to support medical device safety monitoring. For this feasibility study, data relating to women undergoing a procedure to treat stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which leads to involuntary leakage of urine when laughing, sneezing, coughing or through physical activity and pelvic organ prolapse (POP), where organs bulge from their natural position into or outside of the vagina and potential adverse outcomes, will be analysed as a case study.

Additionally, the study will explore the risk of death among adults with IED, overall and within specific at-risk groups.

The main complaints of patients with COPD are breathlessness and a productive cough, and COPD patients often have periods where their symptoms worsen. The Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy categorizes COPD patients into four disease severity groups (GOLD Groups A-D) based on the patients' breathlessness and worsening of symptoms (called exacerbations). In addition, this strategy document proposes treatment choices suitable for each of these four patient groups.  The goals of COPD treatment are to reduce symptoms, reduce the periods of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance. Despite these recommendations, patients do not always receive the recommended treatment based on their assigned GOLD group.  This study aims to describe the patients in each GOLD group and the treatment the patients were prescribed according to those groups.","The purpose of this study is to characterize a COPD population treated in primary care into the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2013 categories (GOLD A-D) based on patients' symptomatic assessment, spirometric classification, and risk of exacerbations. Category A: low risk (for COPD exacerbations), less symptoms; B: low risk, more symptoms; C: high risk, less symptoms; D: high risk, more symptoms.  The GOLD 2013 strategy document also proposes suitable first and secondary choice pharmacologic therapies for each of these groups, however, despite these evidence-based guidelines, observational studies have shown that routine practice of prescribing treatment for COPD is not always aligned with these recommendations.  This large population-based observational study aims to characterize a COPD population treated in primary care into the GOLD 2013 groups, and to describe the prescribing practices of respiratory medication by physicians in the U.K. according to those groups.  Further, demographic and clinical characteristics, outcomes and health care utilisation will be described by GOLD 2013 group.","- Patient demographics

Warfarin is the most popular drug for treating blood clots and preventing strokes. However, patients on warfarin require regular blood tests in addition to other side effects such as bleeding and vomiting which may result in hospitalisation. New anticoagulants (Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban and Edoxaban) that do not require regular blood tests with fewer side effects are now on the market. The marketing authorisation for each new anticoagulant differs and so also the reason for their prescription largely based on the result of clinical trials. Clinical trials however are conducted in patients that may be different from real-world settings. Real-world data studies are crucial to our understanding of the use of new anticoagulants outside clinical trials. The risk profile of patients given the new anticoagulants may have changed over time. The aim of this study is to utilise routinely collected primary care data to study how the use of the new anticoagulants have evolved over time and the characteristics of patients prescribed these drugs.","Warfarin is the mainstay of therapy to reduce thromboembolic stroke risk in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Major limitations associated with the use of warfarin include; a narrow therapeutic window, regular monitoring requirement, multiple drug and food interactions and the risk of haemorrhage. Warfarin alternatives, New oral anticoagulants (NOACs; Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban and Edoxaban) are simpler to dose and do not require therapeutic monitoring. The marketing authorisations for each NOAC are subtlety different creating potential channelling biases which largely remain unaddressed. Clinicians require comparative data to make informed oral anticoagulant prescribing decisions. Real-world data studies are crucial to our understanding of OACs utilisation outside clinical trials. Clinical trial populations may not be universally representative of the general population who are prescribed OACs in routine clinical practice. In addition, the risk profile of patients given NOACs to warfarin may have changed over time. The aim of this study is to utilise real-world data available from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to gain detail insight on the evolution of baseline characteristics of anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation, prescribed different OACs for the first time.","For the purpose of this analysis, the date of anticoagulation treatment initiation in the study period will determine exposure cohorts. The first prescription date for the following OACs: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and warfarin will be considered as the index for assessing the baseline characteristics. For patients with multiple distinct period of exposure to any one of the OACs only the baseline characteristics at the first distinct period will be assessed.

This work using CPRD will inform a larger project (the FRESHER project) by allowing us to investigate the costs associated with having certain common chronic diseases in an English population and comparing them with a population of individuals who do not have common chronic diseases. 

CPRD records which match our inclusion criteria will be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and groups of patients which have chronic diseases will be compared to those without these diseases in primary and secondary care. Linked data will allow us to quantify healthcare utilisation for chronic disease over multiple care settings. For patients with only one chronic disease, excess costs are computed by subtracting the average cost of care for patients without chronic diseases from the average cost of care for patients with identified chronic diseases. For patients with multiple chronic diseases, the cost of care for patients with any chronic disease is subtracted from the cost of care for patients with more than one chronic disease.","This work aims to determine the cost-of-illness (COI) - the excess cost of healthcare utilisation - for 10 Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD's): Stroke, Heart disease, Cancer, Diabetes, Chronic kidney disease (CKD), Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Cirrhosis, Alcohol use disorder (AUD), Depression, and Neurological disorders (Alzheimer's and dementia).

The study population will be all acceptable patients in the November 2017 denominator file who are 18 and over in 2015 with a current registration date before study start and any length enrolment during the study period of 01/01/2015 - 31/12/2015 for practices with a UTS and LCD pre-post 2015. We will identify individuals with NCD's of interest, and compute the average healthcare costs associated with the healthcare utilisation of individuals with each specific NCD for any length within the study period using reference costs from the NHS. We will compare the average healthcare utilisation of patients with NCD's, stratified by age and sex, to those without NCD's.

This work replicates the methodology used to estimate NCD COI in France, Estonia and The Netherlands as part of the FRESHER project. Results from England will be used along with results from other countries to inform the FRESHER microsimulation model used to compare NCD costs across European countries.","- Primary: Quantify differences in healthcare utilisation for people with 10 specific non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - stroke, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis, alcohol use disorder (AUD), depression and neurologic disorders - relative to persons without these NCDs over the period of one year between 01/01/2015 and 01/01/2016.

1616633395-2216,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=24,Aripiprazole and risk of psychiatric treatment failure,"To treat some psychiatric diseases, we use drugs called antipsychotics. One of these drugs, named aripiprazole, is widely used because it has fewer side effects such as weight gain compared to other antipsychotics. However, there is some concern that aripiprazole may rarely provoke a worsening of the psychiatric disease in some patients. To study this possibility further we will study patients who start using aripiprazole and compare them with otherwise similar people who start using another antipsychotic drug to treat psychiatric disease. We will follow these patients for one year to see whether or not patients starting aripiprazole are more likely to have a worsening of their disease compare with patients starting another antipsychotic drug. We will also assess whether the risk of worsening is influenced by the numbers of prescriptions and the dose of other antipsychotics drugs used before starting aripiprazole. The findings of our study are expected to help ascertain whether or not psychiatric worsening is a side-effect of aripiprazole and, if so, to determine potential risk factors, thereby aiding the development of preventive measures.","Since the introduction in 2005 of aripiprazole, a D2 dopamine partial agonist prescribed to manage schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, several cases of abrupt psychotic worsening have been reported. These psychiatric decompensations seem to occur in two clinical situations: in patients previously treated with an antipsychotic who switched to aripiprazole, or in whom aripiprazole is added to another antipsychotic. Therefore, the primary objective of this study will be to compare the incidence rate of psychiatric treatment failure (defined as a composite of hospitalization for a psychiatric event, non-fatal self-harm, or suicide) among a base cohort of antipsychotic users who switch to or add aripiprazole (new users of aripiprazole) relative to those who switch to or add another antipsychotic. This study will be conducted by linking the CPRD, the HES inpatient database, and the ONS (Office for National Statistics) mortality database between January 1, 2000 and March 31, 2016. For each patient who initiates aripiprazole, we will have one high dimensional propensity score (hdPS)-matched patient starting another antipsychotic at the time the patient start aripiprazole, using a prevalent new-user design. Patients will be followed for 1 year for the occurrence of psychiatric treatment failure.","First psychiatric treatment failure defined as a composite of hospitalisation for a psychiatric event, non-fatal self-harm, or suicide within 365 days after antipsychotic treatment switching or add-on; Psychiatric admission using the following ICD-10 codes: organic disorders (F05-F07, F09), substance misuse (F10-F19), schizophrenia and related psychoses (F20-F29), mood disorders (F30-F39), anxiety disorders (F40-F48), eating disorders (F50), behavioral syndromes (F51-F59), disorders of adult personality (F60-F69) and unspecified diagnosis (F99).

They include whether patients are taking specific drugs, or if they have completed certain medical tests. Indicators of care are sometimes developed using the opinion of medical experts only, with little scientific evidence to support them. Historically, this has been a problem as some indicators have been implemented without real world testing, leading to inappropriate treatments.
 
In this project, we aim to evaluate existing and screen for potential indicators of care in atrial fibrillation, which is the most common abnormal heart rhythm condition. Our project consists of two phases. In phase 1 we will test the effectiveness of existing indicators by comparing outcomes of patients receiving the recommended care with those that are not. In phase 2 we will develop a clinical guideline support tool that can be used to screen for potential new indicators. The public benefit of the research is to ensure the indicators of care used in practice are reliable and effective. Although we use atrial fibrillation as a case study, the methods used in our project are generic and can be applied to other medical conditions.","We will conduct a 2-phase case study on indicators of care in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia.

In phase 1 we evaluate existing consensus-based indicators of care as described in the literature [1, 2]. Patients will be divided into a control group, for which the indicated care under consideration has not been applied, and an intervention group. The average treatment effect of the indicated care on selected outcomes will be estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting. To validate the method, we aim to show agreement with our data-driven approach to evidence-based indicators of care in the literature.

In phase 2, a tool that can screen for new potential indicators and re-evaluate the benefit of existing indicators will be developed using regularised survival analysis. We stratify patients into risk groups using Charlson Comorbidity Index, CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, and screen for clinical indicators of care associated with good patient outcomes within each patient group using the regularisation process. The indicators of care correspond to drug therapies, devices, procedures and pathology tests. The Cox proportional hazard model with regularisation will be used to model the time-to-event outcomes with time-varying covariates covering both patient characteristics and interventions.",#NAME?,"Dr William Tong - Chief Investigator - Macquarie University

We know that the number of CYP with ADHD in their medical records is lower than the number in the population who have ADHD. We do not know the reasons why CYP use the health care services before their diagnosis with ADHD or what mental and physical disorders are associated with a later diagnosis of ADHD. We suspect that knowing why CYP use the health services before diagnosis will help us to inform and educate health care workers or teachers about risk factors for a later diagnosis of ADHD. If we can identify patterns of health care service use we may be able to help CYP and their families during a time of distress for them and prevent some of the consequences of mental illness, such as missing school, having other illnesses or failing to achieve well in terms of jobs and prospects in later life. If we can identify physical and mental health conditions that affect CYP with ADHD it will help us to identify opportunities to help these CYP to improve both their physical and mental health and to design interventions to help them and their families","Background and rationale
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common in children and young people (CYP). Previous work in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) suggests around 1% of CYP have a recorded diagnosis of ADHD, in contrast to a community prevalence of 3-5%, which suggests an under-recognition of ADHD. An exploration of mental and physical diagnoses recorded in the health care records and their association with a diagnosis of ADHD is currently lacking. In addition, although there have been studies of the association of ADHD with other mental health diagnoses, currently little is known about the association of mental and physical health disorders in CYP with ADHD in English primary care. 
Objectives:
To ascertain events that predict the risk of a diagnosis of ADHD through an analysis of primary and secondary care medical records.
Methods:
To undertake a cohort study and a nested case control study of children and young people with and without ADHD.
Analysis:
To identify common physical and mental health diagnoses that may be associated with ADHD and quantify the associations in children and young people with ADHD compared to those without.

These drugs have become increasingly popular since being introduced in the United Kingdom in 2007. These drugs effectively lower blood sugar without the side effects of other antidiabetic drugs. However, there is evidence that these drugs may be associated with cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), a rare but deadly cancer. To date, no observational study has been conducted to assess whether the use of the incretin-based drugs is associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Thus, using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we will investigate this possible link within a large group of patients with type 2 diabetes. This study will provide important information regarding the safety of the incretin-based drugs.","The incretin-based drugs are typically used as second-to-third line treatments in the management of type 2 diabetes. While they effectively lower blood glucose via the incretin system, there is some evidence that targeting this system may produce unintended effects. Indeed, the incretin-based drugs may be involved in the development of cholangiocarcinoma, through a mechanism potentially mediated by the expression of GLP-1 receptors on cholangiocytes. Patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma have increased expression of cholangiocytes in tumour tissues, and activation of the GLP-1 receptor via GLP-1 analogues has been shown to proliferate cholangiocytes in vitro and in vivo. To address this, we will assemble a cohort of approximately 190,000 patients newly-treated with antidiabetic drugs between 2007 and 2016, with follow-up until 2017. Use of the incretin-based drugs will be modelled as a time-varying variable, allowing a 1-year lag period for latency. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of cholangiocarcinoma associated with use of DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 analogues, compared with use of 2 or more different antidiabetic drug classes. Secondary analyses will assess whether risk varies by duration of use, time since initiation or by type of cholangiocarcinoma (intrahepatic, extrahepatic or unspecified).",Cholangiocarcinoma.,"Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

Existing patient anonymised clinical care records represent an opportunity to answer important questions about exposures during pregnancy and potentially associated outcomes (for example an early pregnancy loss). To facilitate this, a register of pregnancies identified in the anonymised CPRD primary care database, which includes information on the start of each pregnancy and its outcomes, has been created. However, there are a significant number of pregnancies in the Register for which no outcome has been identified. These pregnancies are of limited use for research. If we do not know whether the pregnancy resulted in live birth, still birth or early pregnancy loss, or the true timing of the pregnancy is unknown, it makes studying drug exposure difficult. This study intends to investigate potential reasons why these pregnancies without outcome may be occurring in the register. This information will be used to improve the method by which the Register is created. Improvements to the Register will make this valuable resource more useful and enable researchers to investigate important public health concerns.","The Pregnancy Register algorithm generates a list of all pregnancies identified in CPRD GOLD. A record in the register represents a pregnancy episode and includes information on pregnancy start and outcome. However, there are approximately one million pregnancies where no outcome has been identified. Scenarios have been identified based on the algorithm's logic and how the data is structured which may explain this. The scenarios describe four problems; (i) real pregnancies where the outcome was not recorded in CPRD GOLD, (ii) ongoing pregnancies at the end of available follow-up, (iii) the patient may not have been pregnant, or (iv) the pregnancy episode may be made up of records which are really part of another pregnancy. Analysis will use an algorithmic approach to query CPRD GOLD and linked datasets to look for supporting evidence for each of these scenarios.

Some patients will have predominant emphysema with incomplete emptying of their lungs during expiration (gas trapping). In such patients, an operation called lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) is effective and aims to remove the worst affected area of the lung. Thus, the remaining lung can function more effectively. Currently, this can be achieved using a fibre-optic camera called a bronchoscope, which have shown to be very effective in carefully selected patients. 
Only a small proportion of COPD patients have the right pattern but it is still a large number of people - roughly estimated to be 15,000 eligible patients in the UK. However, despite the fact that several high quality studies on LVRS showed consistent favourable results, referral for the procedure is extremely patchy and only about 100 operations occur each year. 
We will look at lung function test results to see how many patients have the appropriate pattern. This assessment is based on a new equation produced to predict benefit. The study will help to understand how to develop better treatment pathways.","The measurement of residual volume (RV) - an indicator of the degree of pulmonary gas trapping - is technically demanding and requires specific devices with additional costs. Patients with COPD who have a high enough RV are more likely to benefit from lung volume reduction surgery or another similar procedure. A model to predict RV from forced spirometry measurements (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC) has been recently validated. As a national sample of current practice, we will use linked CPRD GOLD data to undertake a cohort study to provide an accurate estimate of the number of people with COPD who have a high enough RV using this novel equation.  This will establish a more accurate estimate of patients who are potentially eligible for lung volume reduction procedures based on the widely available spirometry. Additionally, we will link the information about RV to whether or not these patients have been referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. 
The information obtained from this study will be used to inform the development of models and strategies to improve access to this form of treatment and reduce health inequality which can then be used as a national resource.",#NAME?,"Professor Jennifer Quint - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

Increasing emphasis is now being given to reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics especially for common respiratory tract infections in the community. In order to achieve this we need better understanding of the risks of infectious complications including pneumonia, if antibiotics are, or are not, prescribed. Some patients presenting in general practice with complaints of common respiratory tract infections, including colds, sore throat, otitis media, sinusitis and bronchitis, might benefit from antibiotic treatment to prevent them from developing pulmonary infectious complications, including pneumonia. A better understanding of risk factors for developing pneumonia following common respiratory tract infections will contribute to informing prescribing practice and the containment of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we will investigate risk factors for pneumonia complicating a presentation of common RTI. We aim to identify key risk factors for pneumonia cases following common RTI consultations using linked general practice (CPRD) and hospital (HES) records. This information will help to support policies for more informative antibiotic prescribing strategies in general practice. The results can also be used by policy makers and the public in general to understand when antibiotics are not required, and when they are.","The increasing challenge of antimicrobial resistance requires more judicious use of antibiotics. Primary care prescribers are encouraged to treat self-limiting respiratory tract infections (including colds, sore throat, otitis media, sinusitis and bronchitis) without antibiotics in order to curb their unnecessary use.

The World Health Organisation have expressed concern that these associations may persist at pollutant concentrations below current European and US limit values.  To investigate possible health effects associated with low air pollution levels, the US Health Effects Institute have funded a collaboration of European researchers to undertake analyses of deaths and other indicators of disease. Patients registered in CPRD in 2010 will be linked to modelled concentrations of air pollutants (fine particles, black carbon (soot), nitrogen dioxide and ozone; vehicular non-tailpipe pollution (Cu, Fe, Zn) and secondary inorganic aerosol; and fine particle concentrations derived from satellite monitoring). Patients who die, or receive their first diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, dementia, or lung cancer or diabetes mortality in the period 2011-2017, will be identified from primary care records, hospital admissions and mortality records. The relationship between concentrations of pollution and risk of disease/death accounting for lifestyle factors such as smoking will be determined.

The symptoms of hypogonadism may include tiredness and depression, lack of interest or enjoyment in sexual activities, increased fat mass, as well as decreased bone and muscle mass, among others. Treatment of hypogonadism with testosterone has been shown to be effective in reversing these symptoms. Previously, there had been concerns that testosterone may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes in men receiving this treatment. However, recent studies have found no such increased risk, and it remains unclear as to whether testosterone is indeed safe for the treatment of hypogonadism. Therefore, the objective of our study is to formally evaluate the safety of testosterone, by determining how frequently men treated with testosterone experience heart attacks and strokes as compared to men who are not treated. We will also determine whether these patients have a higher risk of death. Finally, we will also conduct additional analyses to determine whether the safety of these medications differs among different patient groups, such as the elderly, those with a history of heart attack or stroke, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.","It is unclear whether testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) increases the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Therefore, the objective of our study is to evaluate the safety of TRT, specifically with respect to myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, as well as all-cause mortality. We will create a cohort of men aged 45 or older, diagnosed with hypogonadism, and with no history of TRT use prior to diagnosis. In primary analyses, exposure to TRT will be defined as a time-dependent variable, and Cox regression will be used to evaluate the rates of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality, comparing current TRT exposure to no exposure. These outcomes will be evaluated both as a composite outcome, and separately. In secondary analyses, we will assess whether this risk varies with cumulative duration of TRT use (< 6 months, 6 months - 2 years, > 2 years). The primary analyses will be repeated, with stratification on TRT formulation, as well as patient age (45-59, 60-74, and 75 years and older), history of myocardial infarction, history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease status.

1616633344-2195,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=25,Utility and performance of prognostic algorithms for cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes patients.,"Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease (heart attack and stroke). While most patients receive treatments to manage heart disease risk, long-term interventions are costly and not without risks themselves. Ideally, treatments should be tailored to those in most need, who will likely benefit most as well. 

A number of heart disease prediction rules are available, aiding medical professionals in quantifying a patients' risk, and tailoring treatment regimes. It is currently unclear: which prediction rule performs best in the United Kingdom, if rules predicting any heart disease are sufficient or if heart disease specific rules are more relevant (e.g., separately predicting heart attack or stroke), and whether there is a need for subgroup-specific rules (e.g., for gender, age, duration of diabetes). Finally, it is unclear after how much time rules should be updated to correct for changes in patient- and treatment-characteristics, and whether the usual practice of predicting 10 years risk is sufficiently relevant for diabetes patients. 

By harnessing electronic healthcare data, we will for the first time, systematically compare prediction rules within the same data, tackling the above stated knowledge gaps and deriving novel prediction rules accounting for difference between patients, and type of heart disease.","Objective:
To compare performance of existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction rules in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients and derive novel rules accommodating differences between patient subgroups, and type of CVD. 

Methods and data analysis:
For the first time we will use a single dataset to externally validate existing CVD prognostic rules in T2DM patients on: overall performance, discrimination, calibration and risk classification ( cut-offs <5%, 5%-20% and >20%). Performance will be stratified on: calendar time periods (per year and clinically relevant periods), duration of T2DM diagnosis (</=1,3,5, >/=8 years), history of coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke, type of CVD, ethnicity, geographical location (as proxy for differences in case-mix).  

Novel prediction rules will be derived by extending the Cox proportional hazard model to account for competing risks using the Fine and Grey methodology (Fine & Gray, 1999), allowing for joint prediction of individual CVD elements (e.g., stroke, MI, heart failure [HF]), as well as correcting for risk over-estimation due to all-cause mortality (Lau, Cole, & Gange, 2009). To further increase applicability, a novel nonparametric multivariate method (Andreas C. Damianou, 2013) will be used which can flexibly account for interactions between patient characteristics, and changes in prognostic ability over time (i.e., disease duration).","The primary outcomes are cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the individual CVD elements. All-cause mortality can be considered a secondary outcome as it plays an important role as a competing risk.

A combination of multiple physical, behavioural and social problems often mean that these patients' care needs aren't effectively addressed by the traditional organization of healthcare systems and care delivery. Further, both patients and healthcare staff report the care process of complex patients is chaotic and wasteful, reducing quality and raising costs. Therefore, strategies to redesign care to better meet these patients' needs, and increase the value of the care that is delivered, offer an opportunity to reduce cost. However, there remains a lack of clarity about what care is modifiable, and which patients to target. We will quantify utilisation of primary care (contacts with nurses or general practitioners in general practice, diagnostic tests, immunisations and prescriptions) and secondary care (attendances at emergency departments, inpatient admissions and procedures, and appointments and procedures in an outpatient setting) and attach estimated costs to each individual instance of utilisation. Data will not include utilisation and costs associated with palliative care, prescriptions dispensed in secondary care, and those arising from social care. We will then answer questions including; what are the demographic and clinical characteristics of top 5% and top 1% high cost patients in England, what types of healthcare use make up these costs, and how does this vary across different groups?","At the patient level, for patients of all ages, we will calculate health care utilisation across primary and secondary care for a two year period from March 2014 to March 2016, and cost each part of care delivered using available data on direct costs to the NHS.

It is a major cause of disability, it reduces quality of life and is one of the leading causes of death. An acute exacerbation of COPD can occur when there is a sudden worsening of usual COPD symptoms such as increase in wheezing and shortness of breath, as well as presence of persistent cough. Severe exacerbations require hospitalisation. Several treatments can be prescribed to improve COPD symptoms. Typically, it involves medication called bronchodilators. This class of drug helps to reduce shortness of breath by opening up the airways and makes it easier to breath. However, the relief of symptoms often involves the addition of different type of medicines such as the combination of a long acting bronchodilator with either an inhaled corticosteroid or with tiotropium. The objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of these two different combinations to help prevent the occurrence and the frequency of COPD exacerbation as well as to compare their safety with respect to pneumonia.","The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with the combination of long-acting beta2-agonist with tiotropium (LABA-TIO) compared to the combination with inhaled corticosteroid (LABA-ICS).

In the UK, only patients whose blood pressures are above a certain threshold are considered for treatment. However, recent research studies have shown that even patients with blood pressures below that threshold might benefit from treatment and therefore the current approach may not be the best way to save lives. Other possible approaches to blood pressure lowering treatment include treating based on a patient's age and sex (e.g. treat men >55 and women >65 years), or treating based on a patient's overall cardiovascular disease risk, which takes into account other factors like diabetes, smoking and older age. This approach is used for deciding who should be offered statins. This research aims to provide information to help decide which of four proposed strategies for recommending blood pressure treatment is best for population health. In particular, we will analyse primary care and linked hospital records from CPRD to first work out the number of patients who would be eligible for treatment under each suggested approach, and second, to look at which strategy prioritises treatment to patients who go on to experience heart attacks and strokes.","The current approach to blood pressure treatment in the UK relies predominantly on blood pressure thresholds. This ignores evidence showing that treatment lowers cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk at all blood pressures, with no threshold. One alternative treatment approach would be to use a threshold of overall CVD risk, a strategy that is now accepted for lipid lowering drugs. Another suggested approach is to use age and sex to determine treatment. To help decide on the optimal strategy for population health, there are two key considerations: the number of patients who would be eligible for treatment under each strategy, and whether the strategy prioritises treatment to patients with the highest future burden of CVD. This protocol describes a cohort study to investigate eligibility for blood pressure lowering treatment under four different approaches (i) current NICE guideline, (ii) blood pressure alone (to reflect evidence that some GPs are ignoring the NICE guideline), (iii) cardiovascular risk, and (iv) age/sex. Beginning in 2011, the cohort will be split according to treatment eligibility under each strategy, and followed up for their first cardiovascular disease event.

Approximately 5,000 people are diagnosed with IPF each year and the number is rising. Medications for IPF are available since 2011but there is still no cure. Thus, the search for effective and widely available treatments for IPF is ongoing. As acid reflux is common in patients with IPF and can affect lung function, anti-acid therapies, including proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), have been recommended as treatment for IPF in international treatment guidelines for IPF. However, the evidence supporting this recommendation is weak and it is unclear whether anti-acid therapy is indeed an effective treatment. Moreover, concerns have been raised regarding the overutilization of PPIs, highlighting the need for evidence regarding the effectiveness of PPIs in IPF.

This study will investigate whether the use of PPIs is associated with a reduction in mortality and an increased risk of hospitalisations in IPF patients using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This study will provide much needed information of these potential associations, which will provide support for treatment guidelines and be of value to regulatory committees, physicians, and patients.","Recent observational studies and post-hoc analyses of data from placebo arms of randomised controlled trials in patients with IPF have led to a conditional recommendation of anti-acid therapy as treatment for IPF. However, the evidence supporting the recommendation is weak and may even be biased leading to spurious associations.

Thus, the objective of this study will be to assess the associations between PPIs and all-cause mortality and hospitalisations in a cohort of IPF patients who are at least 40 years of age and newly diagnosed with IPF on or after January 1, 2002 until December 31, 2015. Exposure to PPIs will be assessed in a time-dependent manner. All patients will be followed until death, end of registration with the practice, or end of the study period (December 31, 2016). Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of death associated with the use of PPIs when compared to non-use.

If continuity of care improved, we assess whether this led to fewer emergency hospital admissions. We will obtain data from a random sample of 30,000 patients aged 65-85 in 2012, from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The CPRD is linked with data showing which patients were admitted to hospital. These data contain information on every contact each patient had with their general practice and any hospital admissions between April 2012 and April 2016. This includes a two-year period before and after the introduction of the named GP scheme. This allows us to compare a patient's continuity of primary care and a patient's experience of emergency hospital admission before and after the scheme was introduced while taking into account factors such as age, co-morbidities and practice services.","National Health Service Employers and General Medical Services agreed to introduce from mid-2014 a named accountable GP for all patients aged 75+. This study aims to investigate whether this intervention 1) improved patients' continuity of care and 2) decreased their risk of emergency hospital admission. This cohort study obtains a random sample of 30,000 patients aged between 65-85 in 2012 from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), who were registered with their practice at least one year prior to 2012 and who were alive in 2014. The CPRD is linked with Hospital Episode Statistics showing emergency hospital attendance and admissions. Patients will be followed between April 2012-April 2016, comprising a two-year period before and after the intervention. As a patient's continuity of care and emergency hospital admission will be measured in the pre-intervention and post-intervention period, this study uses a multilevel model to analyse repeated measurements over time (within patients) whereby time-period is level-1, patients is level-2, and general practices is the level-3 unit. A mediation analysis, adjusted for confounders at the individual and practice level, will test the hypothesised causal chain in which a named GP improves continuity of care that, in turn, decrease risk of emergency hospital admission.",Continuity of primary care; GP referrals and admission through A&E.,"Dr Peter Tammes - Chief Investigator - University of Bristol

In recent years, more attention is being focused on medications that play a role in the development of this disease. Enlarged prostate, also known as Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is fairly common as men grow older. A significant proportion of the males with prostate enlargement receives drugs known as 5- alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) for ongoing treatment of BPH. These drugs help to shrink the size of the prostate and reduce symptoms like difficulty urinating. Because 5ARI use is common in people with BPH it is important to understand serious adverse effects caused by 5ARI. The objective of this study is to determine whether 5ARI use increases the risk of blood clots (VTE) among male adult patients with BPH.","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) continues to pose an important disease burden, however a lot remains unknown about the risk factors that cause it. In recent years, more attention has been focused on medications that play a role in the development of drug-induced venous thrombosis. A significant proportion of the adult population receives 5- alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) for ongoing treatment of BPH. Therefore, potential serious adverse consequences associated with these treatments should be investigated. This will be a nested case control study among a population of men who received at least one 5ARI or alpha blocker prescription for treatment of BPH during 1995- 2015 in the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Cases of VTE (pulmonary embolism [PE] or deep venous thrombosis [DVT]) and matched controls will be derived from the base population. The risk of VTE in relation to timing of drug exposure, duration of use and types of drug will be assessed. Descriptive analyses as well as conditional logistic regression will be used to evaluate the relationship between 5ARIs and the risk of VTE. The proposed study in a large population-based database of high quality will efficiently evaluate the safety of this pharmacologic agent, which will guide the development of guidelines for its use in the prolonged care of BPH patients.",Incident Venous Thromboembolism.,"Professor Susan Jick - Chief Investigator - BCDSP - Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program

Staging and grading of cancer give an idea of how quickly a cancer may grow and which treatments may work best. Treatments can include surgery, radiotherapy and drug treatments (such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy or targeted cancer drugs).

The purpose of this study is to understand the characteristics and outcomes of patients diagnosed with several different types of cancer in England. This research will help to characterise these patients in terms of their demographics and medical history, and to describe how long they survive for depending on their characteristics and stage of disease.  This research will help to provide an up-to-date picture of the characteristics and outcomes of patients with these cancers in England.","According to Cancer Research UK, there were around 357,000 new cases of cancer in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2014, however there is limited recent real-world data on cancer patients in the UK. The rationale of this study therefore is to fill this evidence gap and describe the characteristics and overall survival of patients with a number of cancers in England. Specifically, the aims are to understand patient characteristics (demographic and clinical) and survival rates. In order to do this, the study will link data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episodes Statistics, National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service and Office of National Statistics (ONS) in order to provide the most accurate data on patient diagnoses and clinical characteristics. 

Patient demographics, baseline clinical characteristics and tumour status will be analysed descriptively. Overall survival (OS) will be summarized as a continuous variable, Kaplan-Meier curves presented and median time estimated. Death rates will be described separately for those with and without advanced/metastatic cancer.","Outcomes:

- Overall survival (OS): defined as time since index date or initiation of chemotherapy until date of death due to any cause identified from ONS data. 
- Incidence rates of cancers: Number of new cases of a specific cancer in the population in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 expressed as number of cancers per 100,000 population at risk.

The resulting mutated huntingtin protein harms nerve cells in the brain, disrupting their functioning and leading to their death. Although people with HD are born with the mutation, symptoms typically do not appear until the age of 40-50 years. Signs and symptoms of HD include various emotional and psychiatric problems, uncontrolled movements, and loss of intellectual abilities; these symptoms worsen over time.  People with HD usually live for about 20 years after the condition begins. To inform clinical studies for a therapy for HD, a better understanding of the natural course (""natural history"") of the disease is needed. Information about individuals with HD is available, on an anonymous basis, through linkage of the UK's CPRD database, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset, and mortality data (ONS). Examining these data is an opportunity to improve knowledge of HD, its progression, and its impact on the health system.","The study aims to describe the natural history, treatment patterns, and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) of Huntington's Disease (HD) in the United Kingdom (UK).

The clinical characteristics, treatments, and procedures in patients with HD at time of diagnosis, motor-symptom onset, and 3 months before death will be characterized using descriptive statistics. The time to death will be estimated for the incident HD and matched non-diseased cohorts stratified by age strata and sex. A standardized mortality ratio will be calculated by gender and age strata in order to compare the mortality risk of the HD cohort to that of the CPRD population. Total HCRU will also be compared between cohorts to describe the burden of HD on the health system.

They are also related to social class and income. As these risks are preventable, and as they can be influenced by public health policies, we aim to look at them in relation to a common heart condition called atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the commonest cause of irregular heartbeats and a common cause of stroke (a serious medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off).
The reason for doing this research is that atrial fibrillation is increasing and it often requires treatment with blood thinning drugs and therefore is a significant burden; yet for some people it may be preventable by changing our smoking and alcohol drinking habits and by losing weight. The results may help demonstrate potentially correctable risk factors associated with atrial fibrillation. Education about these risk factors may result in a reduction in these risks and the risk of atrial fibrillation.","Lifestyle related factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity affect the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and other related conditions such as high blood pressure and atherosclerosis1-4.

First introduced in the United Kingdom in 2007, these drugs have become increasingly popular because they effectively lower glucose levels in the blood, but without the side effects of other antidiabetic drugs. In addition to their effects on lowering glucose levels, there is some evidence that these drugs may play a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic disease that affects the digestive tract. However, the exact role of these drugs on this disease remains unclear. Moreover, to date, no studies have been conducted to assess whether the use of DPP-4 inhibitors affects the risk of developing IBD. Thus, using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we will assemble a large group of patients with type 2 diabetes to assess this association. This will provide much needed information on the safety of DPP-4 inhibitors.","DPP-4 inhibitors are incretin-based drugs that are now commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. However, in addition to its role in glucose metabolism, there is evidence that the DPP-4 enzyme (also known as CD26) may play a role in IBD, although its specific role is not well understood. On the one hand, this enzyme has been shown to inhibit T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, while on the other, studies have reported decreased levels of the DPP-4 enzyme in serum of IBD patients, which are inversely associated with disease severity; the latter supports a possible deleterious role of DPP-4 in IBD. To address this question, we will assemble a cohort of approximately 130,000 patients newly-treated with antidiabetic drugs between 2007 and 2016, with follow up until 2017. Use of DPP-4 inhibitors will be modelled as a time-varying variable, allowing for a 6-month lag period for latency. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of IBD associated with use of DPP-4 inhibitors, compared with use of all other antidiabetic drugs.

This is because until the cancer is quite advanced, it does not cause specific symptoms. However, patients often present to their GP several times before diagnosis with symptoms that could be caused by early pancreatic cancer. Identifying these patients earlier could lead to a diagnosis when the cancer is less advanced, so more patients could undergo surgery with potential cure. Purpose of the study: Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) of over ten million patients, we will compare the symptoms of patients later diagnosed with pancreatic cancer to patients with the same symptoms who did not have pancreatic cancer. We will also look at their medical history and medications to identify other risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Potential importance of the findings: We aim to create an electronic risk calculator (known as a 'clinical decision support tool'). After reviewing a patient with suspicious symptoms, doctors could enter in the patient's risk factors and other relevant information and the tool would estimate the risk that that patient's symptoms are caused by pancreatic cancer, prompting referral for investigations or a specialist opinion.","Objective: To create a clinical decision support tool to help doctors determine the risk that a patient with a particular set of symptoms and risk factors has a cancer within the pancreas, to assist in deciding whether or not to refer a patient for further investigation. Methods: The anonymised records of ten million patients in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) dataset from 2000 - 2016 will be analysed. Patients with a cancer within the pancreas (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, or biliary tract cancers) diagnosed between 01/01/2001 and 31/12/2015 will be compared to patients without cancer to determine the likelihood that a patient presenting with a particular group of symptoms and risk factors has one of these cancers. Data analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to determine the changing incidences of the three cancer types over the study period. Multivariable regression analysis will examine the associations between the three cancer types and age, gender and level of deprivation, as well as determining whether survival from these cancers has changed in the last 15 years. Regression models, cluster and factor analyses will be used to develop an algorithm to estimate the risk of pancreatic cancer based on an individual patient's symptoms and risk factors.","Primary health outcomes

For both conditions, we will use statistical methods to identify: i) The severity grades; ii) The time it takes to progress from one severity grade to the next using detailed data on patients' diagnoses and prescribed treatments. Also, we will apply our methods to 'forecast' needs for years 2020 and 2030 and consider the implications for future health-care planning for people with these two conditions. We expect the tools and findings produced to be useful for both direct patient care and policy-making.","Background and Objective: Despite that there are numerous grades of clinical severity for most long-term conditions, analyses of routinely-collected electronic health records still tend to characterise these conditions in a simplistic binary (presence/absence) approach. We aim to longitudinally characterise two exemplar conditions, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and coronary heart disease (CHD), to develop clinical decision algorithms that will grade the severity and respective health care needs of patients with T2DM or CHD using linked hospitalisation and mortality data. 
Methods and Data Analysis: In this cohort study, data will be organised and analysed in annual data bins (2006-2016). Over time and by region, age-group, gender and socio-economic deprivation, we will: i) Generate algorithms to estimate severity grades for T2DM and CHD, using within-condition diagnoses (such as complications), comorbidities, treatments and referrals and validate using survival analysis models; ii) Assess the association between the severity scores and the outcomes: cardiovascular disease, hospitalisation and death (including cardiovascular mortality)  iii) Describe the disease progression journey, time needed to progress through severity grades; iv) Using regression modelling techniques, estimate stratified prevalence rates for T2DM and CHD, for 2020 and 2030. We expect the developed algorithms and findings to inform both direct patient care and policy-making.","- Develop cardiovascular disease (CVD)

Stroke is the leading cause of complex disability in the UK, where it affects one in five men and one in six women by the age of 75. Problems with memory, learning and understanding contribute substantially to the disability experienced after stroke and are a major concern for patients and families. Patterns of these cognitive changes vary markedly between individuals and it is not clear why particular groups of patients develop dementia after stroke. One hypothesis is that other illnesses such as infections might play an important role, perhaps by causing inflammation in the nervous system. In this study, we aim to explore whether adult stroke survivors who experience serious infections such as pneumonia, urine and skin infections requiring antibiotic treatment are more likely to develop dementia than stroke survivors without these infections. To do this, we will use anonymised electronic health records from primary care linked to hospital records to compare dementia rates between different groups of individuals after stroke; those with and without common serious infections. Improved understanding of the effect of infections on dementia risk after stroke will help healthcare professionals to prevent and treat infections early to preserve cognitive function after stroke.","Cognitive problems contribute substantially to the disability experienced after stroke and result in a major health and societal burden. Both short- and long-term cognitive changes occur after stroke, but reasons for the development of post-stroke dementia remain unclear. Infections are hypothesised to play a role, perhaps acting through systemic inflammatory pathways that trigger a disordered microglial response in the aged brain. Here we aim to investigate the association between common serious infections and incident dementia in a population cohort of adult stroke survivors using electronic health records (EHR). Using routinely collected EHR data will increase power and generalisability of findings as well as overcoming some methodological difficulties that may hamper traditional cohort studies of post-stroke dementia such as ascertainment bias. We will carry out a multivariable Cox regression analysis to compare incidence rates of post-stroke dementia among stroke survivors exposed and unexposed to infections in time periods after stroke, controlling for potential socio-demographic and clinical confounding factors. In secondary analyses, we will investigate the effect of site, frequency, severity and timing of infections on dementia outcomes. Better understanding of these relationships will help to inform the development and targeting of interventions to prevent and treat infections after stroke and thereby preserve cognitive function.",Early post-stroke dementia (3 months to 1 year); Later post-stroke dementia (1 to 5 years).,"Dr Charlotte Warren-Gash - Chief Investigator - London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM )

It is a major cause of cardiovascular disorders and may lead to kidney disease, blindness, and death. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are relatively new and effective second-to-third line antidiabetic drugs, which can decrease blood sugar levels. They have less side effects that other antidiabetic drugs. However, there are emerging concerns that they may be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic autoimmune disorder primarily affecting joints, and leading to disability. Therefore, this study will determine whether the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes is related to an increase in the risk of rheumatoid arthritis using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This will be investigated using a group of over 130,000 patients with type 2 diabetes, where the users of DPP-4 inhibitors will be compared to the users of other antidiabetic drugs. The findings of this study will add to the current safety profile of DPP-4 inhibitors.","Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are effective second-to-third line antidiabetic drugs. Recently, there has been a controversy regarding their potential association with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While several case reports have suggested a link between their use and the development of RA, an observational study showed a 34% decreased risk. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine whether there is an association between the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and the risk of RA in patients with type 2 diabetes. For this purpose, we will assemble a cohort of patients, at least 18 years old, newly-treated with non-insulin antidiabetic drugs between January 1, 1988 and June 30, 2016, with follow up until June 30, 2017. Use of DPP-4 inhibitors will be modelled as a time-varying variable, where patients will be considered unexposed to DPP-4 inhibitors until 6 months after the first prescription for latency. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of RA associated with use of DPP-4 inhibitors, compared with use of all other antidiabetic drugs. Secondary analyses will assess whether risk varies by cumulative duration of use and time since initiation, and whether there is a drug specific effect.",Incidence of rheumatoid arthritis among patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

Evidence of the benefits of these medications often comes from people who are not like typical patients. For example, they generally only have one condition, and are relatively young and rich compared to the general population.  However, GPs are increasingly looking after an ageing population with multiple health problems.  Little is known about how effective risk-reducing drugs are in preventing heart attacks and strokes in patients with several health problems.
We will investigate whether risk-reducing medication prevent heart attacks and strokes in patients with two or more health problems.  
This work has the potential to benefit a large number of patients.  Patients, with multiple health problems may be more likely to have a heart attack or stroke and therefore gain more from taking preventative medication, compared to patients with fewer health problems.  Yet, GPs may be less likely to prescribe these preventative drugs, as patients with several conditions may already be taking an extensive range of medication.  This study will help us understand the benefits of prescribing preventative drugs in this increasingly growing population.","GPs are encouraged to aggressively reduce cardiovascular risk in their patients through prescribing primary and secondary preventative therapeutic treatments.  Evidence of the benefits from such risk-reduction strategies from RCTs is strong.  However, RCTs are typically conducted among relatively young, affluent participants, who are comparatively healthy with under-representation of other health conditions. It is not clear whether treatment effects demonstrated in RCTs generalise to a multi-morbid population.
The study will use data from adult patients who have been diagnosed with 2 or more conditions and are at risk of CVD from between 2004 and 2014.  The primary outcomes will be an incident CVD event or death, and any death as a secondary outcome.  Our key exposure with be a prescription of a CVD preventative medication, including statins, anti-hypertensives, dual antiplatelet therapy and anti-diabetic agents.

We know that having acute kidney damage increases the chances of developing long-term kidney damage. In people with kidney damage, it is important to avoid prescribing medications that are potentially toxic to their kidneys (known as 'nephrotoxic' medications). Unfortunately, in adults, studies show that many people with kidney damage receive nephrotoxic medications. Like adults, children with existing kidney disease should not be prescribed these medications unless absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, no one has evaluated whether this is currently the case in children. Our suspicion is that these at-risk children are being prescribed nephrotoxic medications as much as children with healthy kidneys. We therefore propose to study if nephrotoxic medications are being prescribed to children with acute or chronic kidney damage, compared to children with normal kidneys. Ideally, children with kidney damage will be prescribed fewer of these medications. This research will be important. If we find that nephrotoxic medications are being prescribed to children with kidney disease, this will represent a huge opportunity to create programs to inform doctors, patients and pharmacists about this reality to help change it.","This is a cohort study of children 18 years of age or under, registered to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) between 1997 and 2016.

'CAPRI',"We now are far more aware that children and adolescents who have parents with mental illness are more likely to experience wide-ranging health disadvantages compared to children and adolescents in the general population. However, current knowledge about the extent of maternal mental illness in the UK, and the associated consequences, is very limited. This study will aim to quantify how many children and adolescents there are who have a mother with a mental illness. We shall also find out whether the numbers have been changing over time because of social changes like the, financial crisis of 2008, or changes in medications for women with serious mental illness that might affect fertility.  We shall also find out if these children and adolescents are more or less likely to use health-care services; which kinds of service they use and what are the associated costs; what diseases are driving any excess healthcare use; and whether they are more or less likely to use preventive health care like vaccination during childhood. The study will provide vital statistical information which will help to develop better planning, support and health services for these vulnerable young people.","Having a parent experiencing mental illness increases the risk of infant mortality and developing mental illness during adulthood. However, little is known about the scale of parental mental illness and other risks for this group of vulnerable young people. The fertility rate of women with a mental illness diagnosis will be determined and compared with women who do not have a mental illness. We will then identify a cohort of offspring of mothers with mental illness, using a probabilistic linkage algorithm.  Exposed children will enter the cohort from the date of maternal mental illness diagnosis, or from birth if diagnosis within five years prior to birth. 
We will use this cohort to estimate the period-prevalence of children with a mother with mental illness. Secular trends will be examined to assess whether this is affected by the widespread introduction of atypical antipsychotic agents and by ecological changes.

This disturbance in blood flow can allow clots to form where the blood moves too slowly. These clots can cause potentially deadly blockages in blood vessels supplying the brain resulting in stroke. NVAF patients are therefore often prescribed medicines that reduce how much blood clots and lowers the risk of stroke. However, use of some of these drugs requires routine monitoring of patients while they are on treatment, which is time consuming. Clinical trials have shown that newer medicines may be just as effective as conventional treatments, but do not require regular monitoring, making treatment simpler and reducing the likelihood that a patient will discontinue treatment. An understanding of the long-term use of these medicines when used in the real world is lacking. In order to provide more information on the use of these medicines we propose to investigate the characteristics of NVAF patients given these medicines, the length of time they use the medicines and how many healthcare interactions they have whilst using these medicines. This study will provide a better understanding of how these medicines are used in England.","Novel Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) have at least equivalent effectiveness and improved safety in comparison to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) such as warfarin. NOACs do not require regular monitoring of coagulation levels, making treatment simpler and potentially more convenient for patients. These characteristics may in turn improve treatment adherence.
 
We will use a cohort study design of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) newly prescribed NOACs in routine clinical practice in England, identified from retrospective data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics. This study aims to describe the characteristics, treatment patterns and healthcare resource use (HCRU) of patients with NVAF in England who are newly prescribed apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or warfarin. The risk of treatment discontinuation will be investigated by treatment class using Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analyses. The frequency of all-cause and NVAF-related HCRU will be described and rates of use by person-time will be reported.

1616633289-2172,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=26,Handling missing covariate data and changes in exposure status:,"In recent years, data collected in routine practice by General Practitioners (GP) have become more widely used to investigate the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, in some cases, the results are in conflict with results from more traditional studies such as randomized trials. This highlights the need to explore potential issues and biases in the analysis of routinely collected health data. 
Two key issues that may be responsible for these inconsistent results are missing data and treatment switching. GPs record only health information relevant to the care of the patient, thus information required to fully address the research question may not always be available, resulting in missing data. Treatment switching refers to a patient swapping prescriptions from one treatment to another, which complicates the comparison between patients on the different treatments.  
Using a recent example in CPRD where the results were inconsistent with randomized trial results, we aim to apply novel statistical methods to handle the aforementioned problems. We can then better understand when it is relevant to take account of such characteristics of the data and provide guidance regarding the relative benefits of different methods of analysis for future studies.","A recent CPRD cohort study suggested between person confounding remained a problem when investigating a potential interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel, as biologically implausible harmful associations were observed. Results from a self-controlled case series (SCCS) on the same data showed no increased risk of MI with PPI exposure and were thought to be more reliable as, in this analysis, fixed between person confounding is removed by design. SCCS limitations mean a more general solution is needed. 

We identified treatment (PPI) switching and exclusion of potentially important confounders due to missing data as key issues. 

To investigate treatment switching, we would perform ""intent-to-treat"", ""per-protocol"" and ""as-treated"" analyses using Cox models, incorporating probability weights accounting for participant differences between those who did and didn't change exposure status during follow-up. We will extend this idea by using more complex approaches such as marginal structural models, splitting data into, for example, 3-month intervals. 

For missing data, we would initially incorporate information from confounders, previously omitted using missing categories approaches and then proceed to multiple imputation based analyses in the different analysis settings outlined above.

Finally, we would investigate methods to incorporate both issues.

PPD is a type of depressive disorder, which occurs within the first month after childbirth. PPD has a profound impact on maternal health and wellbeing, with both short-term and long-term implications for the developing child and wider family. Unfortunately, about 50% of the PPD cases are under-reported even though they are at higher risk for psychiatric disorders. Thus, PPD may result in increased use of national health services and associated cost. There is limited evidence showing health service use in women with PPD using data from different countries.

People with SMI have poorer physical health and a shorter life expectancy than the general population, and are more likely to develop diabetes and associated complications.
Aims: To find out why patients with SMI are more likely to develop diabetes and have more complications from their diabetes, and how the provision of healthcare may contribute to this, so that we can identify ways to improve diabetes care for people with SMI.
Design: We will use anonymised routinely collected information from health records to find out which patients with SMI are at greatest risk of developing diabetes and its complications, and how a diagnosis of diabetes impacts on mental and physical health. We will examine how diabetes is screened for, monitored and managed, to understand what helps to improve diabetes outcomes and how much improving care costs the NHS.
Dissemination: We will ensure our findings are made available to people with SMI, NHS staff and people who make decisions about priorities in the NHS.","Background: People with severe mental illness (SMI) have poorer physical health and lower life expectancy than the general population. A 2-3 fold increased risk of diabetes and its associated complications contribute to this health inequality. 
Aim: Our aim is to improve understanding of the increased risks of diabetes and poorer diabetes outcomes for people with SMI. 
Methods: We will interrogate linked primary care and hospital records for a large representative sample of adults with SMI, SMI and diabetes, and a matched control group with diabetes but no SMI. We will quantify risk factors implicated in development of diabetes in people with SMI, and variation in health outcomes in people with comorbid SMI and diabetes. We will explore variations in diabetes screening and management, estimate costs for these, and determine the role of healthcare interventions in contributing to health outcomes. Analysis will use a range of statistical models, which take account of the structure of the data for each research objective (e.g. multilevel modelling to explore the impact of key variables, and matching methods to compare disparities in healthcare). 
Impact: This knowledge will help healthcare commissioners, providers and researchers to develop targeted effective interventions for this population and improve existing services.","Diabetes status and onset; Diabetic and cardiovascular control (measured by recorded HbA1c, blood pressure, cholesterol levels); Diabetic complications: acute hyperglycemic events, hypoglycemia, micro-vascular complications [retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy], macro-vascular complications [coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease]; Hospital admissions for the above conditions; Mental health outcomes (including SMI relapses and markers of depression or anxiety); Mortality; Healthcare utilisation (including the number and type of primary care consultations) and costs; Healthcare interventions (e.g. medication, care pathways and referrals).","Professor Najma Siddiqi - Chief Investigator - University of York

Capacity to use data contained in large healthcare databases has increased exponentially, however, much of the evidence from large healthcare databases lacks transparency in reporting, making it challenging to assess the reproducibility and scientific robustness of findings. This protocol is part of a series of study replications for the REPEAT Initiative, a project which involves systematically sampling published studies to review and replicate. The goal is to understand what information is missing in public reporting that prevents replication of findings. The outcome of the REPEAT project will be an evaluation of frequency of reporting specific study methods and the impact on reproducibility. Our results will inform policies/guidelines on reporting for database studies. This protocol focuses on replication of one sampled study: 'Rising burden of gout in the UK but continuing suboptimal management: a nationwide population study?' by Kuo and colleagues. The Kuo paper describes how common gout and treatment for gout is in the UK general population between 1997 and 2012.

Symptoms may become rapidly worse in a short period of time - an event known as an exacerbation. Most patients can be managed using one or two long-acting inhaled drugs (bronchodilators) that dilate the airways in different ways. Triple therapy - containing inhaled steroids and two types of bronchodilator - is the most intensive type of treatment, but it is uncertain whether patients do better on triple therapy compared to therapy with two bronchodilators only. More evidence is needed so that clinicians can make informed treatment decisions for their patients. The proposed study will use information observed in anonymous primary care records of COPD patients to compare the number of exacerbations experienced by patients who were prescribed triple therapy and patients prescribed dual bronchodilator therapy. The study will also investigate whether triple therapy slows the loss of lung function more so than dual bronchodilation, and will explore whether the treatment comparisons are influenced by how severe the COPD symptoms are to begin with, or by the way in which the therapy is delivered.","Two designs will be used to study the effectiveness of triple therapy [TT] (inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with long-acting muscarinic antagonist and beta agonist [LAMA+LABA]) in COPD patients with a history of smoking: A.

1616633294-2174,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=26,Developing tools for preventing delirium in primary care,"Delirium involves a sudden onset of confusion, memory loss, inability to focus and difficulty speaking. It is relatively common in older patients in the community, with approximately 200,000 cases every year in the UK. Delirium often precipitates hospital admission and results in loss of quality of life, and increased death rates and healthcare costs. Most research on delirium has focused on hospitalized patients. However there is little data on delirium in older people living in the community and no trials of prevention have been reported in primary care.
We will use anonymised patient medical records to improve our understanding of the causes of delirium in the community and to develop tools to help prevent delirium. Our main aim is to develop tools to help general practices identify patients at higher risk of delirium, so that risk factors (e.g. certain medications) can be avoided. These prediction tools will also help to target information to carers about how to cope if an episode of delirium does develop. Such tools would be of great value for aiding GPs to provide personalised care to their patients at risk of delirium. This project is funded by the National Institute for Health Research.","Delirium often develops following potentially avoidable triggers, especially in patients with cognitive impairments. Risk factors in hospital settings are well studied and evidence suggests that interventions can reduce delirium incidence by up to 35% in hospital settings. In contrast, avoidable factors in community acquired delirium have been little studied. Electronic clinical records, such as the NIHR part-funded Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD) provide cost-efficient opportunities for studying delirium in the community. We will develop a tool to help general practices identify patients at higher risk of delirium.  A case-control analysis, using conditional logistic regression, will identify factors associated with delirium. Prediction models will be trained on the dataset ending in 2014, and validated on more recent (2015 onward) data, using established prediction performance measures. These prediction tools will also help to target information for carers about how to cope if an episode of delirium does develop. The tools will aim to identify those at higher risk of first episodes of delirium, and also those who have had previous episodes.

Drugs used to control blood pressure, cholesterol, and the blood's ability to clot are the most commonly used to prevent heart disease.  Their use has led to major drops in deaths related to heart disease, and many patients now live longer despite having had a heart attack. 
Elderly patients with heart disease are at risk of Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of memory loss. Alzheimer's disease patients are treated with anti-Alzheimer's drugs to help slow down memory loss. Besides their beneficial effect in improving patient's memory, these drugs may also help prevent heart attacks and stroke. We have already discovered in mice that two anti-Alzheimer's drugs can reduce the levels of a biochemical that contributes to the stress of the heart, increases blood pressure and induces blood clots. We now want to see if this beneficial effect exists in humans, and specifically, whether these drugs can reduce the risk of new heart attacks, stroke, and death in elderly patients with heart disease.
We think that the use of anti-Alzheimer's drugs could reduce blood pressure and blood clotting that causes stroke and new heart attacks in elderly patients with heart disease. Building on this hypothesis, this project will allow us to find out whether these drugs can be used to prevent new heart attacks, stroke, and death in elderly patients with heart disease. In this study, we will use the largest health records database in the United Kingdom, CPRD to address the research hypothesis.  This work will provide clues in how the anti-Alzheimer's drugs affect the heart, and may help identify new ways to prevent stroke and heart attacks. In addition, the drugs that we will be studying are already available in Canada, so the results could have an immediate application on the health of heart-disease patients.","Antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone of secondary prevention of acute ischemic events in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Acute and long-term management of patients with CVD has drastically improved their survival; patients live longer on chronic cardiovascular therapy, which creates the potential for drug-drug interactions in the context of polypharmacy, especially in the elderly. 
Cognitive impairment and dementia occur in 5% to 10% of people aged >65 years, and affect up to 30% of those >80 years of age. The most common form of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is treated with anticholinesterases (AChEIs). In addition to their beneficial effects on acetylcholine levels in the brain, our animal research shows that they may also have antiplatelet effects. AChEIs are associated with lower risk of myocardial infarction and death in humans. Furthermore, our published and ongoing work suggests that administration of AChEIs in mice decreases the level of urinary epinephrine, a known sensitizing agent for platelet activity. Therefore, we hypothesize that the use of AChEIs decreases the risk of ischemic stroke, unstable angina, and death, but increases the risk of bleeding in AD patients, especially in those already on antiplatelet therapy",#NAME?,"Faleh Tamimi - Chief Investigator - McGill University

This is necessary to better understand how different treatments or other services provided to patients affect things such as risk of a disease or death. This is commonly done using a multimorbidity ""score"" that varies depending on the number and type of different health conditions a patient has. However, most commonly used scores have important limitations. Examples include scores being ""out of date"" and less accurate in the current health context, being based on non-UK data, or being tailored to predicting a specific health outcome which might not be relevant to other work (e.g. deaths might not be relevant to usage of GP services).

In this project we aim to develop a new score based on health information relevant to UK primary care. Different scores will be developed for research looking at general practice consultations, hospital admissions, and risk of death. We expect these scores to be useful to a wide range of researchers carrying out studies using computerised health records.","In this project, we aim to develop new multi-morbidity scores for three different outcomes relevant in health services research (one year mortality, general practice consultations and unscheduled hospital admissions). We will do this using contemporary electronic health records data from the UK. Our multi-morbidity scores are based on a list of conditions relevant to characterize multimorbidity in UK primary care published by Barnett et al. (2012). It is our intention to provide transparent, simple approaches to coding multi-morbidity in CPRD that will be useful for other researchers..

This is a retrospective cohort study (including linked ONS and Basic HES data). A random sample of 300000 adults will be used for multimorbidity score development, with two separate validation cohorts used to evaluate outcomes over 1 and 5 year follow-up periods.

However, it is well-known that statins do not lower cholesterol in all patients. Many previous studies have suggested that there may be different patient characteristics which can influence how well cholesterol is lowered by statins in different patients. 

As most statin treatments are started and monitored in primary care, there is a need to understand which patient characteristics may affect changes in cholesterol levels. This will lead to the development of a clinical tool to help doctors and nurses to better identify patients who are likely respond to statin therapy from those who do not respond well. 

Using electronic patient records from general practices across the UK, this study aims to: 

1. Identify important patient characteristics of lipid response to statins among patients.
2. Using these predictors, we will develop a clinical tool which can help doctors and nurses to better predict a patient's change in cholesterol when statins are started.
3. Determine long-term heart disease and stroke outcomes in patients who respond well to statins compared to those who not respond well.","Background: There is significant variability in cholesterol lowering and change in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk when statins are initiated, but no method of predicting response to statin therapy.

Objectives: (1) To determine patient factors, routinely collected in primary care health records, associated with lipid response to statins (2) To derive and validate a clinical algorithm to predict lipid response to statins (3) To determine long term cardiovascular outcomes of patients stratified by lipid response.

Study Design: Cohort study using CRPD data and linked HES, patient-level IMD and ONS-mortality data

Setting: UK General Practice

Participants: Patients free from CVD at baseline, registered at their practice at least one year before study entry, being treated with statins, with at least 2 recorded cholesterol (LDL or TC) readings - the baseline measure being within 12 months before the initiation of statins and follow-up measure being within 24 months after intitiation of statins. 

Outcomes: Primary: Change in (1) total cholesterol and (2) LDL cholesterol during 24 month follow-up after initiation of statins; Secondary: First occurence of cardiovascular disease after 24 months from initiation of statins.

Methods: The study population will be randomly split into algorithm derivation and validation cohorts (30% sample). To predict cholesterol response, a repeated measures model (mixed model) will be created. Models will be tested for predictive accuracy in the validation cohort. A time-to-event analysis will investigate relationships between lipid response, patient modifiable and non-modifiable clinical and demographic characteristics, and cardiovascular outcomes.","Primary Primary Outcomes:

1616633244-2154,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=27,Risk of colorectal adenoma after obesity surgery,"People who are overweight or obese are more likely to develop colorectal (bowel) cancer. Because obesity (bariatric) surgery causes weight loss, it might also reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer. However, a previous study from Scandinavia suggested that obesity surgery may have the opposite effect and increase the risk of colorectal cancer.  A recent study of ours using English data did not confirm that colorectal cancer is linked to obesity surgery. However, in this study, patients who underwent bariatric surgery were only followed for around 3 years, which is not enough time for colorectal cancer to develop. Because non-cancerous tumours of the bowel, called colorectal polyps or adenomas develop first and then progress to colorectal cancer, we now propose to study risk of colorectal polyp development, instead of colorectal cancer. Polyps are detected and removed during bowel examinations such as colonoscopy. Clinical Practice Research Datalink data will be used to identify obese patients who have or have not undergone obesity surgery and compare the occurrence of polyps in both groups. Knowledge of whether obesity surgery is associated with increased polyp risk is important to understand future colorectal cancer risk and colonoscopy needs for patients who have undergone obesity surgery.","There is inconclusive evidence of an association between obesity surgery and long-term colorectal cancer (CRC) risk from separate studies in Scandinavia and England, which is partly related to the small number of CRC cases and short follow-up time after obesity surgery. The benign colorectal adenoma (natural history for development 1-3 years) is a recognised biomarker of CRC risk (Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996, O'Brien et al., 1990) allowing a shorter follow-up period in a cohort study.  We propose to use CPRD in order to explore colorectal adenoma risk after obesity surgery.  This will be achieved through: 1) Initial non-parametric estimation of the probability of adenoma development in obese patients who had bariatric surgery and for obese patients who did not have bariatric surgery; 2) risk-adjusted survival analysis investigating the time from obesity surgery to adenoma; and 3) risk-adjusted binary analysis of adenoma development (yes/no) for obese patients with/without obesity surgery. If colorectal adenoma risk is elevated after obesity surgery, it will make the case for a study of the effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance after obesity surgery for reduction in CRC risk. We will also examine the association between obesity surgery and obesity-related cancers (e.g. CRC, esophagus, endometrium or kidney).","- Time to colorectal adenoma

PMR causes stiffness and pain in the shoulders and hips. It has been estimated that approximately 2.43% of women and 1.66% of men will develop PMR in their lifetime and that each year around 8 in every 10,000 people over 40 in the UK develop the condition. Steroid tablets are the main treatment, but some find it difficult to stop taking these medicines.  Various studies have been published that suggest that people who have PMR are at an increased risk of developing heart disease, stroke and certain types of blood cancer.

The knowledge of how common PMR is, and which medical conditions may be linked with it, will lead to better diagnosis and treatment of patients with this condition. The first study will update our knowledge of the occurrence of PMR in England and Wales; this was last investigated in a study over 15 years old. Secondly, we will investigate which other medical conditions are more likely to occur in people with PMR before and after their PMR diagnosis, which will help to understand why people find it difficult to stop taking steroids.","Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory rheumatological condition. Treatment involves low dose glucocorticoids, and is generally effective, although some patients have problems with treatment withdrawal. 

The risk of developing PMR varies depending on geographic location. The most recent data from the UK, from 1996 to 2002, showed an incidence of 8 per 10,000 per year in people aged over 40 years. 

Little is known about comorbidities that may coexist with PMR. This project will 1) re-estimate the incidence and prevalence of PMR in the UK, 2) measure comorbidities before and after PMR diagnosis. For the first aim: incidence rate per 10,000 years, between 1990 and 2017; and point prevalence on 31st March 2017 will be calculated.

For the second, patients with PMR will be individually matched to four controls. Using a nested case-control study, we will calculate the prevalence of individual comorbidities for cases and controls. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals will be obtained using conditional logistic regression. We will then calculate the cumulative probability of each comorbidity up to 10 years after the index date using Kaplan-Meier plots for comorbidities occurring after PMR diagnosis. We will calculate hazard ratios using Cox regression model.",#NAME?,"Dr Alyshah Abdul Sultan - Chief Investigator - Astra Zeneca Ltd - UK Headquarters

There is a need for real-world effectiveness data regarding COPD treatment in order to demonstrate that improvements in lung function translate into reductions in exacerbations, hospitalizations, or morbidity. For comparative effectiveness research to impact COPD patients with multiple illnesses, a shift needs to occur from the heavy reliance on controlled efficacy studies in highly selected populations to observational studies with rigorous study design. Electronic medical records or primary health care data such as the CPRD GOLD provide a platform for these observational studies. We will compare the relative effects of triple therapy treatments (ICS/LABA/LAMA) versus LAMA treatment alone on exacerbations in patients with COPD in a real world setting.

Problems with hormones can lead to disorders, called endocrine diseases, whose signs and symptoms often overlap with other conditions making diagnosis difficult. There is little agreement on the best way to diagnose these diseases; patients often undergo a series of, sometimes contradictory, laboratory and imaging tests, and visits to general practitioners (GPs) and hospital doctors before an accurate diagnosis is made and treatment begins. The objective of this study is to compare the use of healthcare by patients with endocrine diseases (such as Cushing's syndrome, a disorder caused by very high levels of a hormone called cortisol) to other patients without these diseases. This will give information regarding the use of GP consultations, diagnostic tests, medications and hospital referrals, and help to estimate the current cost of the diagnosis and treatment of endocrine diseases in the National Health Service (NHS).","The endocrine system is a series of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream, used to send signals and control bodily functions. Abnormal release of hormones can cause endocrine disorders, which are usually difficult to diagnose.

Little is known about the healthcare resources used and the costs of diagnosing and treating these disorders, especially in the UK. This observational study aims to describe and compare the healthcare use and costs of patients with acromegaly, Addison's disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency and/or primary hyperaldosteronism to that of age, gender and GP practice matched general population control groups.

As a result, an 'attack' (or immune) response is triggered against healthy organs; for example in the heart, lungs, brain or kidney which can lead to pain and in turn severe organ damage. SLE can affect a number of major organ systems in the body, but can be most harmful when the kidneys are affected. This type of kidney disease is called Lupus Nephritis (LN) and can cause the the kidneys stop working properly. However, many SLE patients with LN might not have their condition recorded by their GP. The purpose of this study is to look at other information in medical records that may suggest that an SLE patient has LN. This information will be used to better understand how many people in England are affected by SLE and among these how many patients also have LN.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rheumatic disease affecting multiple organs. Lupus nephritis (LN), which is kidney inflammation linked to SLE, is a potentially severe SLE complication, yet data from the UK regarding the incidence, prevalence, and characteristics of LN patients is lacking. Recent data suggest prevalence of SLE in the UK is 97 per 100 000, with 86% of observed cases being female. It is thought that the prevalence of LN in SLE patients is between 20-60%; however, a previous estimate in CPRD data using two Read codes specific for LN found only 3% of SLE patients recorded as having LN. The aim of this work is to develop a disease phenotyping algorithm for LN to increase sensitivity of ascertainment of LN patients in CPRD-HES linked data, and subsequently, to characterise these patients and estimate disease incidence and prevalence. Increasing the sensitivity of algorithms to ascertain patients with LN in CPRD data will help to better understand the epidemiology of SLE and LN in England and aid future research involving this patient group.",Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) prevalence and incidence; Lupus Nephritis (LN) prevalence and incidence.,"Roelien Postema - Chief Investigator - Bristol-Myers Squibb - USA ( BMS )

We will be using nationwide patient information collected by GPs, and hospitals to conduct our research. These patients will be compared with similar patients without the disease. Also, as AF can behave in very different ways, we want to identify the different groups of patients presenting with this disease in the UK, and the characteristics (e.g. being overweight, alcohol. etc.) which make them more prone to develop specific complications (i.e. which patients with AF develop heart failure, stroke, dementia, cancer, or others). This may allow us to understand which individuals with AF are at higher risk of doing poorly. This is of importance, as we believe that not all AF individuals are equal, and they shouldn't all be treated equally. Some individuals may benefit from treatment specifically aimed at their underlying diseases, which may lead to an improvement in AF while the disease is still in its early form.","The presentation of atrial fibrillation (AF) varies widely, and its natural history, including causes of death, and development of conditions like cancer, dementia and heart failure following its diagnosis remains to be elucidated.

Hypogonadism can occur at all ages. Signs and symptoms depend on when the condition develops and in adults include erectile dysfunction, infertility, decrease in beard and body hair growth, decrease in muscle mass, development of breast tissue and loss of bone mass. Testosterone therapy is considered standard treatment in men with hypogonadism. Most middle-aged and older men, who are treated with testosterone are likely to present with sexual dysfunction, a feature not related to hormone deficiency or to advancing age, but rather to the presence of underlying cardiovascular (heart) disease risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Adverse cardiovascular effects such as myocardial infarction and stroke during long-term testosterone therapy are of increasing clinical significance in view of the ongoing epidemic of testosterone over-prescribing. Recent observational studies have shown conflicting findings regarding adverse cardiovascular effects during testosterone therapy. Preferential testosterone use in patients at increased cardiovascular risk could explain discrepancies of previous studies and this study could be be fundamental in overcoming the limitations of previous observational studies on testosterone use and cardiovascular events.","This study aims to describe the association between the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and new use of testosterone in a population-based nested case-control study in a cohort of men with a GP consultation between January 2001 and the latest data available in the CPRD-HES link.

As kidney function fails, complications may occur causing symptoms which require medical review. When kidney function is very low, renal replacement therapy (RRT) is needed to survive: this is either blood cleaning (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. 

Childhood is an important time for growth, development and education, which is disrupted for children with severe CKD. Early loss of kidney function means a lifetime of complicated, expensive treatments. In the UK, a quarter of children needing RRT present 'late' to specialists, when their kidney failure is very advanced. Medical treatments can slow or delay progression of CKD if identified early however. Understanding if children who go on to develop severe CKD: (1) report symptoms suggestive of a kidney problem before diagnosis and (2) use primary care as a medical point of contact will help better identify children at risk of CKD progression.

The aim of this study is to explore primary care use and symptoms reported by children who go on to develop severe CKD. This will help us to describe important factors relating to childhood CKD and may help improve earlier detection of late-presenting children.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant burden for patients, families and the NHS. CKD progression in childhood not only impacts upon growth, development and schooling, but means a lifetime of renal replacement therapy once end-stage disease is reached.

Medical treatments can slow/delay CKD progression if identified early.  

Objective: To explore primary care use and symptoms reported by children who go on to develop severe CKD. This will help us to describe important factors relating to progression of childhood CKD which may help improve detection.

Blood clots most commonly occur in the veins in the leg and may break off and travel to the lungs, which can be fatal. Treatment of blood clots is with 'blood thinning' medication. The most serious side effect of blood thinning medication is that it causes bleeding. In the past it has been necessary to monitor blood thinning treatment with regular blood tests. New blood thinning tablets have been developed which have a lower risk of bleeding and do not require regular monitoring. Current National and International Guidelines recommend that all patients who have suffered an episode of blood clot in the legs or lung should be assessed and considered for long term blood thinning medication treatment to reduce the risk of suffering a recurrent blood clot. Real world evidence, utilising the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics dataset, can provide additional insight on the role of long term blood thinning medication in patients suffering a blood clot. This research will help inform doctors on the safety and effectiveness of blood thinning medication and thereby help improve the clinical care of VTE patients.","VTE is characterised by the forming of blood clots in blood vessels, and includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). In addition to a high case-fatality rate, recurrence is common. Treatment for VTE focuses on inhibiting the function of clotting factors and breaking up existing clots. Traditional treatment involves vitamin-K-antagonists (VKA), most commonly warfarin. However, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are likely to replace warfarin given the evidence of non-inferiority in randomised trials, and their association with reductions in the risk of bleeding.

For effective asthma management it is important to treat patients with the right inhaler device to ensure optimal medication dose delivery. Studies indicated that the inhaler device is important in the asthma management and impacts patient outcomes. Asthma is managed by different preventer treatments including inhaled corticosteroids. One of them, Qvar (beclometasone dipropionate), indicated as treatment of mild, moderate and severe asthma, is available in three different device types (Qvar Easi-Breathe, Qvar Autohaler and Qvar Aerosol) in the United Kingdom. The first two types are breath-actuated inhalers which release the medication dose during inhalation through the device. The third type is a metered-dose inhaler that is a 'press and breathe' device: for the adequate dose to be delivered, patients need to have good coordination between pressing (device actuation) and breathing (inhaling) the medication. The need to coordinate device actuation and inhalation can lead to improper inhaler use, especially without proper training. This study aims to compare breath-actuated Qvar Easi-Breathe and Qvar Autohaler, with metered-dose inhaler Qvar Aerosol. We will also compare breath-actuated Qvar to other metered-dose inhalers (beclometasone treatment not restricted to Qvar).","We will conduct a hypothesis testing study to determine if Qvar via breath-actuated inhaler (BAI) is associated with different real world outcomes compared to Qvar via metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in the United Kingdom (UK).

1616633239-2152,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=27,Association between diabetes control and risk of fractures: a follow-up and a nested case control,"Aside from many other health problems related to diabetes, an increased risk of bone fractures has recently been recognised as another possible complication. The risk of fracture has been reported to be higher among patients with type-1-diabetes than with type-2-diabetes, and was observed in men and women.
However, only few studies on this topic have focussed on the impact of blood sugar control by analysing the patient's HbA1c-values; HbA1c-values represent the amount of red blood cells to which sugar (scientifically ""glucose"") is bound and transported in the blood. The amount of bounded glucose is an indicator for mean blood glucose concentration within the previous 8 weeks and therefore an important marker of diabetes control.
It is unclear, how antidiabetic drugs and HbA1c-values are associated with the risk of fractures.

Only two previous studies which examined the association between HbA1c-values and fractures included substantial numbers of patients, while other studies were small. To our knowledge there is no study that analysed the risk of fracture associated with use of antidiabetic drugs according to HbA1c-levels, considering also the timing and duration of drug use.
In our large study we will explore the association between diabetes control (blood sugar level, HbA1c value), and the fracture risk in patients with diabetes type 1 or type 2 according to their antidiabetic medication and medication scheme. This would help answer the question whether good diabetes control could prevent fractures in diabetes patients in accordance with their diabetes medication, an important piece of information for both patients and GPs.","We will conduct a follow-up study followed by a 1:4 matched nested case-control analysis in diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) to explore the association between diabetes control (based on HbA1c-levels), diabetes duration, and the risk of low-trauma fractures. In an additional analysis, the association between diabetes medication/medication scheme will be assessed in combination with the diabetes control on the risk of fractures.

Cohort study:
We will identify a cohort of newly diagnosed diabetes patients within the study period (01.01.1995 - 31.12.2015). Patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes must have >3 years of history in the database before their first diabetes code, respectively. We will follow the DM patients until they experience a low-trauma fracture. The time from diabetes diagnose to fracture will be analysed for various categories of HbA1c-levels. The goal of this analysis is to quantify the fracture risk in relation to diabetes duration.

Nested case control analysis:
Each diabetes patient who experienced a low-trauma fracture after the diabetes diagnosis will be matched to 4 diabetes patients with no recorded fracture. Cases and controls will be matched on age, sex, general practice, index date, diabetes type, and diabetes duration (follow-up time between diabetes onset and fracture date) by risk set sampling. For our additional analysis on the risk of fractures according to diabetes control and diabetes medication/medication schemes (timing and duration of drug use), only type 2 diabetes patients will be analysed. In this additional study we will match on age, sex, general practice, and index date by risk set sampling, but not on diabetes duration. Patients for the additional analysis are also required to have >3 years of history in the database before their first diabetes code.
The goal of this analysis is to examine the association between diabetes control and the risk of fracture. Medication prescribed to diabetes type 2 patients will additionally be taken into account to assess this association in the mentioned additional analysis.

In the past, studies have tended to look at either the development of new CVD in healthy people or the progression of CVD in patients who already had the disease. Studies that examine both CVD development and progression are rare, but allow researchers to compare the risk of death in healthy people and patients with different types of CVD. This comparison may help identify patients at particular risk of death, for example in men compared to women, ethnic groups, and across different age groups. It will also allow researchers to study whether patients at greater risk of death differ from low-risk patients in terms of the care they received and what their risk factors are. The results may allow researchers to identify how doctors can ensure the best care for all patients. We therefore use data available for patients admitted to hospital with CVD in England linked to general practice and death certificate data to investigate what people then go on and die from in healthy people and CVD patients.","Epidemiological research in cardiovascular disease (CVD) is traditionally divided into incidence and prognostic studies investigating respectively the period up to and the periods after the occurrence of CVD events. Investigations are rare that combine these two periods among healthy individuals and survivors of CVD within the same study population. Such studies allow researchers to compare patients from primary and hospital care with regard to mortality risk using the period up to CVD events as baseline risk period. This cohort study therefore jointly examines data from the general population (CPRD) and CVD patients (HES) in relation to disease-free survival and post-CVD prognosis (ONS). Healthy individuals enter the cohort in primary care and are followed up for mortality up to and after the initial presentation of 11 CVD phenotypes. Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate the effect of intercurrent non-fatal CVD events on CVD, non-CVD, and all-cause mortality. With this unified approach we will assess whether initial presentation of different CVD phenotypes has heterogeneous effects on the subsequent prognosis and possible explanations for such heterogeneities by differences in primary and/or secondary prevention. The study results may enable researchers to identify best practices and missed opportunities in current healthcare services.","Primary outcome:

A combination of specific classes of inhaler drugs, called inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs), are used to treat moderate and severe asthma. Even though treated with ICS/LABA, some patients may still be uncontrolled, that means that their breathing will still be painful and challenging, For these patients quality of life will be lower, and they will need to take more drugs. As a consequence, the costs of these patients for the public health services will be higher. Patients with controlled asthma have 40% lower costs than patients who have uncontrolled asthma, due to fewer hospitalizations and emergency department visits. We aim to understand the characteristics of these patients who are not fully controlled with ICS/LABA drugs, as these information could improve patient care.","The primary objective is to identify the predictors of asthma sub-optimal control, among all patients newly treated with medium or high dose ICS/LABA in a fixed dose combination (FDC) in primary care, in their first year of follow-up. The secondary objectives are to identify and describe the two groups of patients controlled and sub-optimally controlled regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment pathways following the first sign of asthma sub-optimal control, and Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) in the one-year period after the index prescription.
The cohort of patients with asthma newly treated with an ICS/LABA FDC between 01 January 2007 and 31 December 2014 (or the latest date available in both CPRD and HES at the time of data access) will be selected among the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) subset of patients linking with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset. A multivariable Cox model will be used to identify the predictors of sub-optimal asthma control in the primary objective, and descriptive statistics will be computed for the secondary objectives.

If doctors could identify the people who have a higher risk of dying, they may give them additional help. Doctor surgeries in England have kept information about people with epilepsy in a large computer database. This information is available to researchers, with patient names removed so that no one can be identified. Our study will use this information to find out what can increase the risks of death in people with epilepsy. Using this database with 14 million patient records, we will look at the information on people with epilepsy. About 1% of people in the UK have epilepsy, so we can expect to have records on about 140,000 people with epilepsy. Some risk factors could be for example having other illnesses, having seizures often, not taking medication as prescribed, alcohol and illegal drug use. 
Using statistics, we can look at which factors increase the risk of death in people with epilepsy, by comparing the records of people with epilepsy who died to those that did not. By having a list of factors, doctors could identify which of their patients are at higher risk of death.","Epilepsy is the fifth highest treatable cause of death before 75 for males, and eighth highest for females; this situation is worsening, rather than improving. It may be possible to avert deaths by identifying those at risk and offering extra guidance. Our aim is to find what are the avoidable risk factors for death in epilepsy that can be identified using routinely available GP electronic data? 

We will conduct a cohort study using data form the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), supplemented by Office of National Statistics data. Available will be 14 million patient records, containing 140,000 records of people with epilepsy (PWE), with estimated 1,200 epilepsy-related deaths. 
Exposure data includes: alcohol overuse, depression, substance misuse, injury (e.g. accidents), self-injury, overdose and suicide attempts, a record of seizure free status, adherence to antiepileptic drugs, smoking, and predictors of vascular disease (including hypertension). We will report the risks of premature death in epilepsy for each variable. 

We believe this will provide potent evidence with which SUDEP Action and others can advocate for routine identification of risk, the provision of step-up approaches to management of epilepsy, and mortality-prevention in UK primary care.","- Death in epilepsy  (primary outcome)

Real-world data, as collected in the Clinical Practice Research Database, can offer valuable insight into the benefits and risks of new drugs used outside of a well-controlled clinical trial setting. Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) are a new type of blood thinners that prevent the occurrence of blood clots. An important side effect of these medicines is the risk of bleeding. Although we do have information from the clinical trials about the benefits and risks, more research is needed to determine the benefit-risk balance of these medicines in a real-world setting. Additionally, it is still unclear if the benefit- risk balance would be different for specific subgroups, such as patients with an impaired kidney function or with an older age. With the current study we would like to understand the prescribing and use of DOACs in a real-world setting as well as assessing the risk of major bleeding in DOAC users to further establish the benefit-risk balance.","Since the introduction of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) there are still some uncertainties around the effectiveness and safety compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), especially with the respect to bleeding within specific subgroups. This study is undertaken to 1) assess the safety of the DOACs compared to VKAs in (subgroups of) patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in a real-world setting, 2) describe the utilization of DOACs in the EU for treatment of NVAF, and 3) describe prescribers' compliance with recommendations made in the summary of product characteristic for each DOAC.

Risk factors are thought to include obesity and diabetes. It is estimated that up to one in every three people in the UK may have early stages of NAFLD. NAFLD may progress to liver scarring (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis - NASH), ultimately causing liver failure (cirrhosis). The underlying inflammation in the liver may be a further risk factor for heart disease and cancer, due to the important roles of the liver in a number of pathways including the immune system, cholesterol metabolism and blood thinning regulation. We will use a large database of electronic health records to explore a) how common NAFLD is and how often it progresses to significant liver scarring c) whether NAFLD is associated with a range of cardiovascular diseases and cancers d) how people with NASH cirrhosis use healthcare services. Our findings, may allow for new screening strategies in individuals at risk of these conditions.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) exists within a syndrome of disturbed metabolism, including increased total body adiposity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidaemia. NAFLD covers a spectrum of lesions ranging from steatosis to a complex pattern of hepatocellular injury and inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]) in the absence of substantial alcohol intake. NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of mortality, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being the most common cause; increasingly, NAFLD is also emerging as a risk factor for pre-malignant and malignant disease; the validation of NAFLD as a significant additional risk factor would have direct relevance for primary preventive strategies. We will use linked primary care, hospitalisation, disease registry and mortality data in England, to investigate associations of NAFLD with progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer, as well as incident cardiovascular disease and malignancies. We will include people aged 18 or older, with no prior liver disease or excess alcohol use. We will use time series analysis to compare incidence of disease between individuals with and without NAFLD/ NASH. Since NAFLD exists within a metabolic syndrome we will also examine the healthcare utilisation of individuals with NASH cirrhosis as an important secondary outcome measure. Our findings may be used to design new screening strategies in individuals at risk of these conditions.","Primary Outcomes:

Most patients who die from cardiovascular disease will first develop HF. Substantial differences in health care use and money spent on healthcare are known to exist between the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA) but it is not clear whether this difference translates into differences in prognosis. We propose to evaluate the long outcomes of patients with HF in the UK compared to the USA. How well Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) and Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) work in HF have been established only in highly selected patients in narrowly defined inclusion criteria and broad exclusion criteria in prospective randomized controlled clinical trials. How well they work in the broader patient population with HF is unclear. Comparing practice patterns and clinical outcomes in 'real world' patients receiving ICD and CRT across different health systems with widely differing practice might help clarify benefits and improve patient management in both countries.","As a national sample of current practice, we will use linked CPRD GOLD data with HES and ONS to undertake a cohort study to provide an accurate estimate of the number of people with HF in the UK.

Aromatase inhibitors have replaced tamoxifen as the mainstay treatment of breast cancer in post-menopausal women. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates these drugs are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in comparison to tamoxifen. These signals are alarming as postmenopausal women represent a population already at increased risk of cardiovascular risk. However, further studies are required to confirm whether aromatase inhibitors are associated with increased risk of severe cardiovascular events in comparison to tamoxifen. To address this safety concern, we will study a group of patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Datalink. We will determine whether treatment with third-generation aromatase inhibitors is associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events in comparison to treatment with tamoxifen in this group of patients. This study should provide evidence to clinicians and patients groups with strong evidence regarding the cardiovascular safety of these drugs in the real-world setting.","Aromatase inhibitors have replaced tamoxifen as the mainstay treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer in post-menopausal women.

Almost 1 out of every 3 people will develop shingles in their lifetime. The risk and severity of shingles increases with age.  The most common complication of shingles is post-herpetic neuralgia, which is a long-lasting pain that can last for months after the rash.

In 2013, a vaccine to prevent shingles was made available in the UK to older adults in their 70s. Based on clinical trials, the vaccine was shown to prevent shingles disease and lessen its effects. However, clinical trials study the effects of vaccines in selected populations under controlled conditions. It is therefore important to study the effects of vaccination in unselected populations in routine clinical use.

With this study, we aim to assess how well the vaccine works in real-life by estimating the amount of shingles disease among elderly that has been prevented through introducing the zoster vaccine in the UK in 2013.","Herpes zoster (HZ) is characterized by a unilateral dermatomal rash and pain. The most common complication is post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).The UK introduced Zostavax in the national immunization program in 2013. The vaccine was routinely offered to 70 year-olds and, as part of the catch-up, to 79 year-olds.
 
Until now, the vaccine effectiveness has not been studied in the UK general population. We will perform a cohort study, aiming to estimate the effectiveness of zoster vaccination against incident HZ and PHN in elderly in England. Particularly, we propose a cohort study based on health-records of the CPRD population eligible for linkage with HES APC databases and belonging to the birth cohorts: 1943-1946 (routine) and 1934-1937 (catch-up). We will estimate vaccination coverage by birth cohort over time, incidence rates of HZ, PHN and HZ complications and vaccine effectiveness against HZ/PHN and HZ complications. We will additionally explore risk factors for vaccine failure. We will use a Poisson regression model with interaction effects between risk factors of interest and vaccination status as it would allow disentangling HZ/PHN risk factors and risk factors for vaccine failure.

Diagnosing myeloma is difficult because early symptoms that people have are also common to people without cancer and can include back pain, bone pain and repeated infections. At present, half of all myeloma patients visit their general practice (GP) doctor more than three times before they are referred on to cancer specialists. These delays are thought to contribute to the poor survival seen with this type of cancer.

The main complaints of patients with COPD are breathlessness and a productive cough, and COPD patients often have periods where their symptoms worsen. The goals of COPD treatment are to reduce symptoms, reduce the periods of worsening of symptoms (called exacerbations), and improve health status and exercise tolerance. Currently, COPD patients are treated with drugs that open airways or reduce inflammation in the lung.  For patients with severe disease, a combination of two or three types of drugs is recommended.  In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of a combination of three different types of drugs called multiple inhaler triple therapy. Few studies have reported on the treatment patterns of this newly emerging combination treatment.  Thus, this study aims to describe multiple inhaler triple therapy use in COPD patients in a primary care setting, including duration of therapy, clinical characteristics, and patient and disease factors that may play a role in the prescribing patterns.","The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize a cohort of COPD patients who initiate an inhaled triple regimen (LAMA+LABA+ICS by either using three separate therapies or a monotherapy coupled with a fixed combination dual therapy). In a cohort of COPD patients who were actively registered in CPRD practices, we will describe the patients' demographics, disease burden, and heath care resource utilization in the 12 months prior to initiating inhaled triple therapy.  In addition, we will describe what maintenance treatment the patient was on prior to stepping-up to inhaled triple therapy, the duration of triple use over 12 months, and the treatment modification that lead to the discontinuation of triple therapy.  There will be two distinct study-time periods for data collection.  The first will begin in mid-2011 to allow for capture of possible treatment patterns before the approval of the LAMA/LABA therapy and the second will begin mid-2013, to capture treatment patterns after the LAMA/LABA drug was approved, which came to market in early 2013 as part of the triple regimen.","- Patient demographics

A few studies have raised concerns that tiotropium and ipratropium bromide, two drugs similar to aclidinium, may have adverse effects on the heart. Heart failure and death are described as a potential risks for aclidinium. The objective of this research is to evaluate, through a series of studies, the potential for heart failure and death with aclidinium use. The first study is evaluating the risk of all-cause mortality, and it is ongoing. The second of these studies is on the risk of heart failure. In this study we will calculate and compare the risk of heart failure among users of aclidinium with the risk among and users of other medications to treat chronic lung disease. The study will take into account differences between users of aclidinium and users of the other medications on factors associated with lung disease including lifestyle factors, socioeconomic status, other cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases, use of other medications, and severity of lung disease.","This nested case-control study aims to evaluate the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure in patients initiating aclidinium bromide and other study medications as compared to LABA and in patients initiating aclidinium bromide as compared to patients initiating other COPD medications. The case-control is nested in a cohort of patients aged 40 years or more with COPD initiating aclidinium bromide or other COPD medications in the CPRD in the UK between 2012 and 2017. All confirmed cases of hospitalisation for heart failure will be included in the nested case-control study. Density sampling will be used to select four controls for each case. Exposure to study medications will be ascertained by recorded prescriptions in the CPRD. Heart failure and heart failure date, and diagnosis for comorbidities of interest, will be defined based on information from the inpatient Hospital Episode Statistic (HES) dataset, the GP OnLine Dataset (GOLD). Statistical analysis will include: 1) descriptive statistics of the cohort, 2) descriptive statistics of cases and controls, and 3) conditional multiple logistic regression to estimate crude and adjusted risk ratios for hospitalisation for heart failure overall and stratified by subgroups of interest.",First-ever hospitalisation for Heart Failure.,"Dr Cristina Rebordosa - Chief Investigator - RTI Health Solutions

Data on England-specific rates for bleeding events are lacking in the literature. This study seeks to understand, among patients undergoing selected operations, how often patients experience bleeding events, whether certain patient characteristics are associated with an increased chance of experiencing bleeding events, and what impact bleeding events have on hospital length of stay (LOS). This study is designed to improve current understanding of intra and post-operative bleeding within England and the burden it places on the healthcare system.","The objective of this retrospective, observational cohort study is to evaluate the incidence of, risk factors for, and hospital LOS associated with intra- and post-operative bleeding events in selected operations in the English inpatient hospital setting. Patients will be selected for study if they underwent an operation of interest (index operation, grouped as: coronary artery bypass graft/valve replacement; aortic operation, heart transplantation; cholecystectomy; hernia repair; hysterectomy; knee/hip operations; low anterior resection; lung operations; mastectomy; prostate operations) between Jan-1-2010 and Feb-29-2016. For each index operation group separately, the incidence of bleeding events (diagnosis of haemorrhage and haematoma complicating a procedure, bleeding requiring transfusion, and/or bleeding requiring reoperation) will be ascertained during the hospital spell in which the index operation was performed (index hospital spell) and within 14 days post discharge; event occurring during the index hospital spell will be further classified as being intra-operative vs. post-operative. Incidence will be expressed as the proportion of patients experiencing each type of bleeding event during the index hospital spell (separated by intra- and post-operative), within 14 days post discharge, and/or both.

There are several reasons why the disease can develop including viral infections, heavy alcohol use, being very overweight, or some reactions to medicines. Receiving a new liver through a transplant can help treat serious disease but a new liver can be found only for less than 5% of seriously ill patients and most of these patients will never see a liver transplant doctor. Liver disease can be prevented and blood tests can help doctors identify patients at risk. There are, however, many high-risk patients who cannot be identified based on these tests.

We wish to understand which patients with abnormal liver blood tests develop severe liver disease. We also wish to understand how to identify those high-risk patients who are not picked up using liver blood tests. The results of this study may help to find people with early liver disease before they develop severe disease. This will leave more time for preventive treatments such as medicines or lifestyle changes to work and result in less people developing severe liver disease.","Cox proportional hazard regression will be used to identify predictors associated with liver disease outcomes in a cohort of patients with abnormal liver function blood tests (LFTs). By calculating the risk of developing liver disease outcomes according to a range of risk factors, we plan to build a predictive model to identify people at risk. Within the cohort, we will use self-controlled case series design to determine whether, after an episode of a common infectious illness (e.g. urinary tract infection), patients are temporarily at an increased risk of liver-related hospitalisation. Using conditional Poisson regression, we will estimate the incidence ratios (risk) of hospitalisations during each such risk period compared to hospitalisations during other time periods.

Using a case-control design, we aim to understand how to identify patients who, regardless of normal LFTs, develop cirrhosis. Cases will be those who develop cirrhosis despite prior normal LFT results. Controls will be patients without cirrhosis or abnormal LFTS (selected using Incidence Density Sampling). Multiple logistic regression will be used to identify predictors of cirrhosis in patients with normal LFTs.

A first report of a medical case suggesting an association between Parkinson's disease and epilepsy was first published almost 100 years ago. Epilepsy is a brain disorder leading to sudden changes in behaviour and to involuntary movements, so-called epileptic seizures. Since then, several reports and small studies have reported that patients with Parkinson's disease may have less epilepsy than the general population, but this has been challenged by more recent reports. In this study, we aim to compare the number of patients with new-onset epileptic seizures between patients with or without Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we aim to explore the role of lifestyle parameters, co-medication, and other diseases known to be associated with epileptic seizures between patients with new-onset epileptic seizures and individuals who do not develop epileptic seizures.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. The pathophysiology of PD is not yet fully understood. Death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, degeneration of other neurotransmitter systems and cell loss in other brain stem nuclei and in the cortex are considered as major causes of both motor and non-motor symptoms.  In 1928, an inverse relationship between the evolution of newly diagnosed Parkinsonism (a syndrome characterised by bradykinesia, tremor at rest, rigidity and postural instability) and the number of seizures was first described among patients with epilepsy. Since that time, the topic has remained controversial (1-4). In this observational study, we aim to quantify crude incidence rates (IRs) of epileptic seizures among patients with incident PD and among a matched comparison group of individuals without PD, and to assess an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of epileptic seizures in patients with or without PD. In nested case-control analyses embedded in these cohorts, we aim to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of seizure-provoking lifestyle parameters, co-medication and comorbidities among cases with epileptic seizures and matched controls.",#NAME?,"Professor Christoph Meier - Chief Investigator - University of Basel

COPD can lead chronic breathing problems and even death. One of the main causes of this disease is smoking cigarettes, but COPD can also be caused by other factors, such as dust. There is no cure for this disease, but symptoms (difficulty in breathing) can be managed with treatment. Medicines that are inhaled are often used to help improve breathing. But these are not effective in all patients, meaning some patients continue to have problems breathing even after using inhaled medicines. We would like to be able to determine which patient groups have improved breathing so that we only treat people who will benefit from the medicine. One factor that may be useful to identify these patients is a type of blood cell called an 'eosinophil'. The level of eosinophils can be identified following a blood test. People with high eosinophil levels in their blood are perceived to benefit (improved breathing) more from inhaled medicines. This study will aim to see if these eosinophil blood levels can help identify which people using inhaled medicines will have improvements in their breathing.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a medical condition characterized by enhanced airway inflammation, and is known to be responsible for mortality and morbidity of millions of individuals worldwide. While traditionally lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils were considered key players in the inflammatory process of COPD, recent findings suggest that eosinophils have a key role in the disease pathophysiology. Exacerbations of COPD are the primary outcome as these greatly affect a patients' quality of life. The benefits of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to reduce exacerbations have mainly been observed in patients having eosinophil airways inflammation. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between the use of ICS among patients with or without blood eosinophilic inflammation, and the risk of exacerbations. This study will be a cohort study of all users of ICS. The primary outcome of the study will be a COPD exacerbation (secondary outcomes include: COPD-related hospitalizations or death). We will use Cox regression analysis to identify the risk of exacerbations, hospitalisation and all-cause mortality adjusting for relevant confounders, among patients with different blood eosinophil levels, and Kaplan Meier curves will be used to show the difference in survival time.

We know that there are significant differences in the prevalence of diabetes, and in the risk of these major disease outcomes between different ethnic groups. What we do not know, is where along the care pathway these differences stem from. The aim of this study is to identify areas of healthcare which can be modified in order to reduce the risk of future disease amongst people with type 2 diabetes. We will firstly explore whether individuals from different ethnic groups are equally likely to visit their GP and have high levels of risk factors identified. Secondly, amongst patients classified as being at high risk for heart and blood vessel disease, we will examine whether medications for controlling blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol are prescribed equitably between ethnic groups. Finally, we will examine whether the benefits of these treatments reduce the risk of disease equally between ethnic groups. This will establish an evidence base for future clinical trials and guidelines for the management of diabetes tailored to the multi-ethnic UK population.","Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of vascular disease, with co-morbid hypertension and hyperlipidaemia increasing risk further. UK studies have found substantial ethnic differences in the risk of vascular outcomes amongst individuals with type 2 diabetes. Whether these inequalities stem from differences in healthcare usage, quality of care, or differences in treatment efficacy remains unknown. Pharmacological control of blood pressure and blood glucose has been shown to profoundly reduce vascular risk. However, to date, no study has adequately examined whether these benefits manifest equally across different ethnic groups. The aim of this study is to identify clinical factors underlying ethnic inequalities in vascular outcomes of type 2 diabetes in order to generate an evidence base for clinical management of diabetes tailored to the UK population.

Most head and neck cancers arise from the lining of the mouth and throat, and can be related to major risk factors including tobacco use, alcohol consumption and human papilloma virus. Other common chronic oral diseases are also known to increase the risk of developing HNC. These include oral lichen planus, oral submucous fibrosis, leukoplakia, and periodontal diseases. In the UK, little is known about the relationship between these diseases and HNC. Consequently, it is unclear whether individuals with HNC associated with these diseases could have more aggressive behaviour comparing to others without. Previous studies suggested that following their primary cancer; these patients were likely to develop more episodes of HNC and hence increase the rate of death. 
We plan to use data from a large number of patients to assess the association between these common oral diseases and the development of HNC. The findings of the study will improve our knowledge about the behaviour of this cancer in these oral diseases as well as gathering information that could help doctors to improve their patients' management with/without risk of HNC.","We aim to assess the associations between oral lichen planus (OLP), oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), leukoplakia (LK) and periodontal diseases (PD), and the development of head and neck cancer (HNC) in a representative sample of the UK population using electronic health records from primary and secondary health care databases during 1997 to 2014.

Blood clots in the veins and lungs are a leading cause of death in cancer patients. The treatments associated with active cancer and blood clots include chemotherapy, radiation, hormones and other treatments. The relationship between the different types of treatment for cancer and the development of blood clots is not well understood. Furthermore, cancer therapies have changed over the last decade with a greater choice of chemotherapy, more targeted radiotherapy, and hormonal/biological therapies cutting off the blood supply to deprive of nutrients the tumour itself. Hence contemporary data is needed on trends over time in the relative contribution of cancer therapies and the change in the association between cancer treatment and the development of blood clots. The purpose of this study is to quantify the association between cancer therapies and the risk of first blood clots in patients with active cancer.

People of all ages, skin type and gender can develop vitiligo and it is estimated about 1 out of 100 people, around the world, has vitiligo. In addition to environmental and genetic factors, it is thought that psychological trauma may occur before vitiligo develops and contribute to the cause of the condition. Further, recent research has shown people with vitiligo are more likely to experience depressive symptoms than those without vitiligo. This finding could be due to the unpredictable prognosis of vitiligo, the current lack of a cure or the skin playing an important role in self-perception. We therefore propose to examine the risk of depression and anxiety in adults diagnosed with vitiligo compared to the general population using routinely collected data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We will determine whether the relative risk of depression and anxiety varies by age, sex, and other patient characteristics such as ethnicity. Reliable population-based estimates of the psychological burden associated with vitiligo are important to gain a better understanding of the condition and to ensure patients are provided with the appropriate psychological support following diagnosis.","There is currently a lack of large population-based studies providing reliable estimates of the risk psychological co-morbidity associated with vitiligo in the UK.

It is a common condition affecting 1 out of every 100 people in the United Kingdom (UK). However, epilepsy is not as common as other diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, making it a challenge to study using traditional methods with small numbers of patients. This is problematic since the disease is estimated to cost over £2 billion annually in the UK. Epilepsy is also associated with a greater risk of certain other illnesses and death. 

The risk of epilepsy in the elderly has almost tripled over the past 40 years yet this population remains understudied compared to other age groups. Previous studies have suggested a link between epilepsy, heart disease, osteoporosis, mental health issues, and death. The risk of these conditions may be even higher for the elderly with epilepsy. However, the overall number of people with elderly with epilepsy makes it difficult recruit sufficient patients to draw precise conclusions. We propose comprehensively examining the risk of other physical and mental disorders, and death, in the elderly with epilepsy using large, linked electronic health records to improve care for this vulnerable and disadvantaged population.","The incidence of epilepsy has almost quintupled over the past 40 years likely due to longer lifespans and the consequent accumulation of medical conditions that predispose to recurrent seizures. Despite this, epilepsy in the elderly remains a remarkably underexplored condition. Epilepsy itself is associated with increased risks for heart disease, osteoporosis, mental health disorders, and death. These risks are reasonably expected to be even higher for the elderly. Hence, we propose using age 65, a data-driven empirical definition of elderly with epilepsy, to study this issue. Multiple analyses will be performed on independent cohorts. First, we will isolate all those over the age 65 and perform multivariate Cox regression analyses, using epilepsy diagnosis as the exposure and treating it as a time-varying covariate, to determine the hazard of a variety of somatic and psychiatric conditions in relation to incident epilepsy. We will then replicate this analysis using all-cause and cardiac-specific death as outcomes controlling for known confounders and the potential effect of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. We will then perform similar analyses, using age 65 as the index date, to determine the influence of prevalent epilepsy (accumulated risk) on the same outcomes and mortality.",null,"Colin Josephson - Chief Investigator - University of Calgary

In this study we intend to find out how common AF is in under 65s and what proportion of young AF patients would benefit from anticoagulation therapy. Additionally, we want to see if we can define patients with a high risk of AF using information contained in routine medical records. We hope the information we gather can help us design a study to find out whether some young people should be screened for AF.","Untreated atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a five-fold increase in the risk of stroke. While age is a key determinant of AF, about 20% of AF occurs in people under the age of 65. Younger individuals experiencing stroke will lose more years of healthy life than older individuals, and therefore may benefit more from AF detection. However fewer young patients will have the diagnosis and not all of these will benefit from stroke prevention therapy, so there is still uncertainty about the benefit of screening people under 65 for AF. Additionally, there is value in determining whether information contained in GP medical records could be used to target high risk people in younger age groups in a potential screening programme. We propose two retrospective cohort studies. Cohort (i) will include all AF incident cases at any time and will be used to calculate AF incident rates, calculate the patient's cardiovascular risk at diagnosis (using CHA2DS2-VASc risk score) and examine how this risk varies over time. Cohort (ii) will be random sample of people under 65 years between 2004 and 2016 that will be used to calculate AF incidence rates stratified by cardiovascular risk.",Atrial fibrillation incidence rate; CHA2DS2-VASc score.,"Dr Duncan Edwards - Chief Investigator - University of Cambridge

Most people with COPD and asthma require regular inhaled medication as the mainstay of their treatment. Inhalers used for asthma and COPD make up some of the most expensive drug costs for the NHS; three of the top five most expensive NHS drugs are inhalers. There is a drive towards providing value care and therefore, when cheaper inhalers (usually generic, non-trade name, inhalers) come onto the market there is often an implementation of policies to change patient's medication. Sometimes cheaper preparations contain the same active substance but other components differ, including the inhaler device which may require a different technique to use. The effect on a medically stable asthma or COPD patient's control is completely unclear; however, anecdotal patient reports and small studies suggest this policy may increase the risk of acute exacerbations (sudden worsening of respiratory symptoms). This study will measure the risk of acute exacerbations after financial-induced inhaler switching in clinically stable asthma and COPD patients; the finding of either an increase or null effects on the risk of exacerbations will provide valuable information for healthcare workers, patients and policy makers.","We will use CPRD linked with HES and ONS to conduct a self-controlled case series (SCCS) to measure the difference in the risk of an acute exacerbation, in patients with asthma or COPD, shortly after a switch of their usual inhaler instigated at their GP practice for technical reasons, compared to times when a switch has not been instigated. SCCS is suited to this current research question as there are precise timings available of a transient exposures (inhaler switch) and a non-recurrent event (first acute exacerbation during follow-up). The incidence rate ratio of acute exacerbations will be estimated comparing exposed periods (3 months following the inhaler switch) to unexposed periods (11 months before inhaler switch and 9 months after) in a conditional Poisson regression model. SCCS implicitly controls for time invariant confounders but time varying confounders will be controlled for in the analysis. We will investigate potential effect modification by disease type, severity of disease, and inhaler switch type by stratified analysis.",Incident asthma exacerbations; Incident COPD exacerbations.,"Professor Jennifer Quint - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

Studies have shown that patients with atrial fibrillation have an increased risk of stroke, therefore, most of these patients are provided with ongoing treatment with a blood thinner that is meant to prevent stroke and is recommended lifelong. For years, a medication called warfarin was the main treatment used in atrial fibrillation, but its use is complicated by the need for frequent blood tests to make sure that the concentration of warfarin in the blood is not too high, as this may result in serious bleeding. This limitation has led to the development of another class of drugs, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which do not require monitoring by blood tests. DOACs were introduced in the UK in 2008 as potential alternatives to warfarin, and specifically licenced for atrial fibrillation in 2011. Uncertainty about the real world safety and effectiveness (clinical benefits and harms) of large-scale use of DOACs, however, remains. The purpose of this study is to examine the real world safety and effectiveness of DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation.","The objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of different DOACs in patients newly diagnosed with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and treated by anticoagulation. Three matched cohorts, matching on baseline propensity scores, will be built to compare 1) use of Dabigatran vs. Rivaroxaban, 2) use of Dabigatran vs. Apixaban and 3) use of Rivaroxaban vs Apixaban. The investigators will carry out separate population based cohort studies using administrative health databases in Canada, the United States (US), and the United Kingdom (UK). Only new users of anticoagulants (previously unexposed to any oral anticoagulant in the 365 days before) will be included. Cohort entry date will be defined as date of first dispensation/prescription for the oral anticoagulant. Patients will be considered exposed to the drug they received at cohort entry date for their entire follow-up time. The primary outcome will be the relative incidence of a composite of ischemic stroke or systemic embolization. Outcomes will be modelled using Cox Proportional Hazard survival models to estimate the hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

The severity of eczema can vary substantially between individuals and within individuals over time. Even in mild eczema, the itch and soreness can affect all aspects of quality of life, including quality and quantity of sleep, poor school attendance, time off work in adulthood and poor self-esteem, resulting from visible skin disease. 
There are many reasons why eczema might be associated with worse medical problems. Eczema is associated with changes in the immune system, including inflammation and reduced ability to fight infections. Eczema may also be associated with lifestyle factors, relating to the effect of eczema on quality of life. There is increasing evidence that eczema may be associated with a range of important medical outcomes. Recent inconclusive evidence suggests that eczema may be associated with increased risks of some cancers and reduced risks of others and that severe eczema may increase the risk of death. This study will take advantage of a large data set that follows many individuals over time to determine if there is an association between eczema and cancers and death.","The objectives of this study are to use data from Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD), Hospital Episodes Statistics and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to examine associations between eczema and cancers and death.

Identifying people with eczema :
Populations with eczema will be identified in CPRD using a recently developed validated algorithm (in press) comprising Read codes and therapies and /or using ICD-10 codes in linked HES data. 

Eczema and cancer and death:
There is conflicting data regarding the associations between eczema and specific cancers. A recent publication also suggests that mortality may be increased in individuals hospitalised with eczema, however, there is limited data on all cause and cause-specific mortality in the general population. We will examine if adults with eczema have higher rates of specific cancers and death (all-cause and cause-specific mortality). We will use time-updated Cox regression to compute hazard ratios with 99% confidence intervals to assess the associations between eczema and each outcome. We will examine the robustness of our results using several sensitivity analyses.","Cancer Study Primary outcomes:

The result of the body's reaction to the 'harmful' substance can range from mild (itching or coughing) to fatal (anaphylactic shock). Peanut allergies usually first appear in childhood and remain into adulthood. Those with peanut allergy often have other allergies and related conditions such as eczema or asthma that are linked to the body's over-sensitivity. 

The aim of this study is to use CPRD data to discover how many people in a UK population have an allergy to peanuts, how they are treated and how their health is affected by the condition. We will calculate how many people with peanut allergy have other allergies and atopic conditions and compare their healthcare costs with those of matched patients without peanut allergy. We will also describe the use of adrenaline and antihistamine therapies for peanut allergy.

These findings may improve our understanding of how many people are affected by peanut allergy and of how it is treated.","This study aims to calculate the difference in cost of healthcare services in those patients with and without peanut allergy. The objectives are to identify a population with peanut allergy and to describe the prevalence of the condition.

We will also characterize the use of adrenaline and antihistamine therapies for peanut allergy.
Peanut allergy will be identified from CPRD GOLD and HES inpatient data, and patients with peanut allergy will be matched 1:1 with two reference groups of non-exposed patients. The first reference group will be matched on age, sex, practice, year of registration, and linkage status; the second on the same criteria plus atopic status. 
Comparisons of rates and costs of health services between cohorts will use Mann-Whitney U-test. Time to death for patients with peanut allergy compared to reference cohorts will be compared using a Cox proportional hazards model.

MG typically affects women aged less than 40 years and older men (over 60 years). MG is a rare disease, affecting only 30.5 in 100,000 people in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2013. While modern treatments allow patients to lead productive lives, 10%-15% of patients are unresponsive to standard treatment. Many of these patients experience worsened symptoms all of the time, which significantly reduces their ability to engage in simple daily activities such as talking, chewing, swallowing, walking, driving and even breathing normally. These patients are additionally at increased risk of lung failure (myasthenic crisis). For these patients, there is an unmet need for a new therapy that can safely and effectively control the disease. The aims of this study are therefore to identify and describe non-responsive (refractory) patients and to assess their burden of illness.","MG is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction caused by autoantibodies at the nicotinic acetylcholine (AChR) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) receptors. Initially typical patients present with extraocular muscle weakness (ptosis or diplopia), and subsequently develop limb, bulbar, and/or muscle weakness (Generalised MG). Standard first-line treatment for MG involves acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or thymectomy followed by prednisolone, a corticosteroid. Patients whose symptoms do not sufficiently respond to these therapies are administered immunosuppressants (ISTs) and/or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). Approximately 10-15% of patients cannot tolerate and/or do not respond to an escalating regimen involving ISTs/IVIg and continue to demonstrate symptoms; these patients are known as 'refractory', These patients experience severe and debilitating symptoms, including: slurred speech, difficulty chewing and swallowing, impaired vision, limb and respiratory weakness and even respiratory failure (myasthenic crises). Using real-world data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), this study aims to identify patients with refractory generalised MG, and to assess their burden of illness, in clinical and humanistic terms, and their resource utilisation relative to patients with non-refractory MG and age- and gender-matched individuals without MG using CPRD and a patient questionnaire.

The dose of most of the drugs of the class has to be adjusted according to the level of patients' kidney function. Linagliptin can be prescribed irrespective of kidney function as it is not excreted via the kidneys. Nevertheless, a recent UK study demonstrated that 42% of T2DM patients with moderate or severe renal impairment were initiated on a DPP-4i (except linagliptin) dose which was higher than the recommended dose in relation to their kidney function. The proposed study aims to explore a) whether T2DM patients with moderate or severe kidney impairment who are initiating on a higher than the recommended dose of a DPP-4i have their dose adjusted or switch to other, appropriate DPP-4i therapies for the level of kidney function during follow up visits to their GP, b) whether patients with no kidney impairment who initiate on an appropriate DPP-4i dose have their dose adjusted when their kidney function is reduced to levels requiring dose adjustment c) whether there are regional variations in inappropriate prescribing of DPP-4 inhibitors across the 13 CPRD defined regions. The findings of this study will aim to contribute to medical education informing GP prescribing decisions.","DPP-4i drug class is indicated for the glycaemic control in patients with T2DM. According to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), Saxagiptin, Sitagliptin, Alogliptin and Vildagliptin require dose adjustments for patients with certain level of impaired renal functionality. Linagliptin, being available in only one dose of 5mg, is the only drug of the class which does not require dose adjustments in relation to patients' renal function as is not excreted via the kidneys. A recent CPRD study, however, demonstrated that 42% of T2DM patients with moderate to severe renal impairment initiated on a DPP-4i (except linagliptin) were on a higher than the recommended dose for the level of their renal function. Adopting a retrospective cohort study design, the primary objective of this proposal is to examine patterns of dose adjustment and therapy switching occurring within DPP-4i class amongst T2DM patients with moderate or severe renal impairment initiating on a higher than the recommended DPP-4i dose for the level of their renal function, as well as among T2DM patients with no renal impairment who have subsequently their renal function reduced to levels where dose adjustment is required. Moreover, a secondary objective of this proposal is to provide insights about patterns of regional variation of inappropriate prescribing in the country based on a cross-section of data from the 13 UK regions available in CPRD. To address these objectives a number of analyses have been suggested. In the first analysis a cohort of T2DM patients with impaired renal function (expressed by an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or a clinical record indicating a stage 3/3a/3b/4/5 renal disease), who initiate on a high dose of a DPP-4i inhibitor will be followed up for at least 12 months and Kaplan Meier curves will be potted and descriptive statistics will be generated to describe dose adjustment and therapy switching in the cohort. High DPP-4i dose occurrence in this patient cohort will be also described on regional level according to the 13 CPRD UK defined regions. In addition, a cohort of T2DM patients with no evidence of renal impairment who initiate on a high dose of a DPP-4i but subsequently develop renal impairment will be characterised in terms of their post renal impairment DPP-4i prescription to assess the occurrence of dose adjustment/therapy switching.","Amongst patients with moderate or severe renal impairment initiating on a higher than the recommended DPP-4 inhibitor dose for the level of their renal function): Counts and percentage of patients who have their DPP-4 inhibitor dose adjusted or switch to another, appropriate DPP-4 inhibitor therapy overtime; (As above) KM curves (time to event) for dose adjustment/DPP-4 inhibitor therapy switching; Amongst patients with no renal impairment who initiate on the high dose of a DPP-4 inhibitor: Counts and percentage of patients who have their therapy changed or switched when their renal function is reduced to a level where therapy switch/dose adjustment is required; Counts and percentage of inappropriate prescribing of DPP-4 inhibitors in CPRD defined regions across the UK.","Professor Kamlesh Khunti - Chief Investigator - University of Leicester

A few studies conducted while mirabegron was being developed have raised concern that this drug may be associated with cardiovascular (heart) problems. The objective of this research is to evaluate, in real-world practice in the United Kingdom, if there is an association between mirabegron use and heart problems. In this study, we will calculate and compare the occurrence of several cardiovascular outcomes, including heart attack, stroke, and death, among new users of mirabegron and new users of several other medications commonly used to treat overactive bladder.","This will be a cohort study comparing the incidence of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes among new users of mirabegron and new users of any comparator antimuscarinic medication, as a group, used in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Incidence rates for the following CV outcomes will be calculated: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI); Stroke; CV mortality (comprised of coronary heart disease [CHD] death and cerebrovascular disease death); All-cause mortality;  and a composite measure of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as the first of AMI, stroke, or CV mortality. The incidence of these CV outcomes will be estimated within each of two exposure cohorts and additional analyses of comparisons of mirabegron to individual antimuscarinic medications will be conducted. We will compare CV incidence after exposure to mirabegron and to antimuscarinics. Potential confounders will be addressed and the outcomes will be modelled, accounting for differences in follow-up time between the cohorts. Adjustment for potential confounders will be performed by matching on propensity score (PS) to balance cohorts with respect to factors present at or before the time of cohort entry. Results will be expressed as estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of the study outcomes along with confidence intervals (CIs).","Cardiovascular outcomes: acute myocardial infarction, stroke, CV mortality, all-cause mortality and a composite measure of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as the first of AMI, stroke, or CV mortality.","Dr Alejandro Arana Navarro - Chief Investigator - RTI Health Solutions

1616633106-2114,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=29,The routine use of electronic healthcare record data to strengthen signal evaluation and early pharmacovigilance decision making in UK medicines regulation,"Medicines are tested in clinical trials prior to being licenced for use. These trials often exclude vulnerable patients and are unable to detect rare side-effects or those that occur a long time after starting the medicine. Therefore it is important to continue monitoring a medicine's safety once it starts to be used routinely. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency operates the Yellow Card scheme which gathers reports of potential side-effects from patients and healthcare professionals. However, just because a patient experiences a particular event while taking a medicine it does not mean that the event was caused by it. Therefore reports are carefully examined before a decision is made as to whether the medicine is likely to have caused the event. If this is considered to be the case then actions can be taken to inform people of the risk and prevent it happening. To inform this decision it is important to understand the characteristics of patients prescribed that medicine and the risk they would be at of experiencing the event even without taking it. This study will explore to see if the CPRD can provide data for this purpose and if it can inform the decisions made.","Despite use of signal detection algorithms the assessment of causality using spontaneous adverse event reports is complicated by the limitations of such schemes, which are subject to under-reporting and which lack comparator data in unexposed patients meaning that the impact of any biases in reporting is unclear. There is likely to be a benefit in placing potential safety signals arising from such reports into the context of the size and characteristics of the treated population at an early stage to assist assessment and that electronic healthcare record data could enable this. This is done routinely in vaccine pharmacovigilance through the use of observed vs. expected analyses and methodological and logistical approaches have been developed facilitating wider adoption of this approach for all medicines. This study will explore when and how descriptive analyses of CPRD data can more routinely provide useful insights that will increase efficiency and/or scientific robustness of regulatory assessment regarding safety signals earlier in the pharmacovigilance cycle. Analyses will be conducted at a drug substance and Read code level for drug-event pairs raised as signals and will include descriptive analyses of patients initiating treatment and/or experiencing an adverse event including exploration of any temporal relationship using chronographs.","The analysis will be applied to all adverse events of interest using Read codes at a pre-specified level within the code hierarchy so that the outputs are accessible if needed. However, the decision about whether the analyses will be specifically accessed and reviewed for a specific product will be made on the basis of signals arising from other sources (e.g. Yellow cards) that are discussed at an expert advisory group. Sub-Read codes will be combined with their parent code. The three pre-identified case studies will focus on salivary hypersecretion, alopecia, and cognitive disorder. Custom groups for combining Read codes to better identify a number of adverse events commonly associated with drug exposure will be included in the analyses and, if such events feature in signals raised, will be accessed and reviewed.","Dr Katherine Donegan - Chief Investigator - MHRA

However cases of CVD are preventable by addressing behavioural factors or starting the uptake of statins (cholesterol lowering medication). In the UK statins are recommended if a patient's 10 year risk of developing CVD is above 10%. Accurate risk prediction for all patients is therefore very important. Statistical models such as QRISK2/3 have been developed to predict CVD risk. Such models are commonly evaluated on their ability to predict the average risk across larger groups of patients. Despite this, these models are primarily used to make risk predictions for individual patients and to decide the treatment path for a patient. There may be more uncertainty around an individual risk prediction that needs to be explored and understood. If there is sufficient variation about a patient's risk prediction it may warrant the collection of further data before prescribing statins or recommending lifestyle changes. This project aims to identify sources of variation in patient risk that are not recognised in existing models.","We will assess the magnitude of the variation in patient risks due to sources not incorporated into the QRISK2/3 models. The overall objective is to assess what range of risks a patient may have given a predicted risk from the algorithm, which is based on the average for a group. We will run simulations on a patient level, generating the potential bias and excess variation in an individual patient's risk prediction. Hypothesised sources of uncertainty include: omitted covariates, failure to account for time trends, mean imputation of covariates, geographical variation and the interoperability of the model when applying in a different setting. In each stage we will get an estimate of bias as a relative rate and an estimate of the variance. This will be done by simulating potential patient risks based on information derived from the datasets (e.g. association of the time and incidence of CVD). The effect of each source will be calculated separately and then combined at the end to produce a new risk prediction for each patient. We can then look at the range of potential risks of patients with a similar risk core in the original model.",Coronary heart disease (angina and myocardial infarction); Stroke; Transient ischaemic attacks.,"Professor Tjeerd van Staa - Chief Investigator - University of Manchester

Existing evidence shows that there are large differences in how quickly a diagnosis is made by cancer type, as well as by patient age, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. To improve clinical outcomes as well as patient experience, it is important to understand why certain patient groups experience a longer time to diagnosis, and study what happens after they first see their family doctor and before a diagnosis is reached. This study examines the consultations, investigations, referral and relevant treatment patterns in primary and specialist care leading up to a cancer diagnosis in patients with a range of common cancers, in order to determine factors associated with a longer time to diagnosis. The findings will form the basis for developing interventions aiming to improve the timely diagnosis of cancer.","Timely diagnosis is important for clinical outcomes including survival, patient experience and health system efficiency. While we know that variations in biological, patient and healthcare factors may contribute to a later diagnosis when treatment with curative intent is not possible, relatively little is known about how they do so and the responsible mechanisms that may be amenable to interventions. Examining patterns of variation in healthcare events and treatments before a diagnosis is made can highlight inequalities in current clinical practice that may represent missed diagnostic opportunities. We will first study patterns of pre-diagnostic events including symptoms, primary and related specialist tests, referrals and primary care prescriptions for a range of common cancers. Using quantile regression, we will then examine how pre-diagnostic events are associated with the total healthcare (time of first presentation with a relevant symptom to diagnosis) and primary care (time from first presentation to referral) intervals.

Given large numbers of patients are seen in primary care (the majority of NHS consultations take place in primary care), rising expenses threaten the ability of the NHS to provide effective healthcare. A recent study suggests there is an urgent need to better understand GP workload, particularly changes in the number of tests ordered from primary care over time. To address this, we will determine if the total number of tests ordered from primary care has changed over time (2000 - 2015), the change in use of 25 specific tests over the same time period and differences in test use across different parts of the UK. This research will determine if test ordering from general practice has increased over time, identify specific tests that have increased most rapidly over time and as well as specific tests that are used more frequently in some regions in the UK. These results will inform policy makers of changes in test use, which can help contribute to policy changes required to help NHS sustainability.","Over the last decade, the NHS has experienced an unprecedented spending rise, net expenditure has increased by over £50bn, an ~80% rise.

Autistic people are also more likely to take psychotropic drugs (drugs that affect the brain) than people without autism. It is unclear whether these drugs are being used as direct treatment of core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or to treat co-morbidities of ASD. The limitations with these previous studies are that they only studied a small number of patients, or used older data and so are unlikely to reflect current practice. Studies in the UK have also generally only looked into specific psychotropic drugs. In this study, we will compare the types of psychotropic drugs taken by people with ASD and people without ASD. We will also examine other types of mental health conditions they have, and which interactions they have with healthcare professionals in general (for example referral to specialists or hospital). The results of this study will help us understand which types of treatments autistic people receive in the real world, and which factors affect their likelihood of getting such treatments.","This is a retrospective cohort study using secondary data.

It is characterized by breakdown of cartilage and bone in the joint resulting in pain. Several studies have shown that patients with diabetes are more likely to have osteoarthritis. It is generally thought that this is because diabetic patients are more likely to have a higher weight, causing osteoarthritis. However, several studies found that diabetes is a risk factor for osteoarthritis regardless of weight. On the other hand, other studies did not find this result. In some studies, total joint replacement is used to define osteoarthritis since it is unknown whether a diagnosis of osteoarthritis is well recorded. However, the reliability of total joint replacement as a definition for osteoarthritis has also never been examined. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the risk of osteoarthritis in patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes using two different definitions of osteoarthritis: a clinically recorded diagnosis or total joint replacement. Additionally, studies have shown that OA is diagnosed approximately 8 years after onset of the disease. We therefore repeated the analyses looking at the effect of including periods up to 10 years during which an OA diagnosis may not occur.","Several studies have proposed that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may be an independent risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA). As it is unknown whether a diagnosis of OA is well recorded, total joint replacement (TJR) is commonly used as a proxy of OA in epidemiological studies. However, the reliability of TJR as a proxy has never been examined. The use of TJR may introduce bias due to confounding by disease severity, as severe T2DM patients may not undergo elective surgery due to contraindicating comorbidities. We therefore aim to compare different definitions (e.g. diagnosis of OA and TJR) of OA, while examining the association between T2DM and OA. All patients who received their first prescription of a non-insulin antidiabetic drug (NIAD) will be selected as T2DM patient. Each T2DM patient will be matched to one patient without a NIAD in the entire follow-up. Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate the risk of the outcomes. Additionally, an OA diagnosis shortly after onset of T2DM may not reflect the actual date of onset of the disease and could result in biased estimates. Therefore, additional analyses will be conducted adding a latency period up to 10 years after first NIAD prescription.",A diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis; A diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis; Total knee replacement; Total hip replacement.,"Professor Frank de Vries - Chief Investigator - Utrecht University

This valuable resource is expensive and costs are rising as the number of people living in the UK increases. The people in charge of local health care budgets (clinical commissioning groups, CCGs) aim to make sure public money is spent wisely and to lower costs wherever possible.  Some CCGs have said that people who are smokers may not have hip or knee replacement operations. However, although we know that smoking damages health, we do not know if it makes a difference to how well someone gets on after this type of operation. 

This study will compare smokers, ex-smokers and non-smokers who have had hip or knee replacements to see whether there is a difference in how well they get on after surgery.  We will see whether there is a difference in the numbers of infections, heart attacks, stroke, deaths, blood clots, poor wound healing, and need for further surgery.  This information can then be used to help decide whether patients should stop smoking before a hip or knee replacement.  Further work might then look into whether this would save money for the NHS.","At this time of unprecedented financial pressures on the NHS, some clinical commissioning groups have stipulated that patients must stop smoking before routine total knee or hip replacement surgery (TKR or THR).  However, there is little evidence to support these actions.  Associations between smoking and poor clinical outcomes are generally accepted, but the specific impact of smoking on outcome after TKR and THR is poorly understood. 
This study will use data from CPRD patients who underwent TKR or THR to compare clinical outcomes and healthcare costs in smokers and ex-smokers to those of people who have never smoked.  The outcomes of surgery are: infections (wound, respiratory, urinary, and skin), wound dehiscence, myocardial infarction, stroke and transient ischaemic attack, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, poor wound healing, readmission to hospital for any cause, analgesic use, septic arthrodesis, surgical revision and mortality.  We will also evaluate 6 month change in Oxford hip or knee score and EQ-5D, and by combining these with mortality outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). To do this we will use a retrospective cohort study design. Regression modelling will be used to describe the association of smoking on outcomes. Logistic regression will be used for binary outcomes (infections, wound dehiscence, myocardial infarction, stroke and transient ischaemic attack, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, poor wound healing, readmission to hospital for any cause, analgesic use, septic arthrodesis), survival models (Cox and Fine & Gray) for time to event outcomes (surgical revision and mortality), and linear regression for continuous outcomes (Oxford hip and knee scores, EQ-5D, QALYs and costs).

To fill this important gap, clinical researchers have proposed to leverage the information contained in large, routinely collected health datasets (such as CPRD). The purpose of this project is to appraise and validate statistical methods that can estimate differences in treatment effect in different population sub-groups from clinical practice data. We propose to do so in the context of anticoagulant treatment for atrial fibrillation patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of abnormal heart rhythm and can lead to blood clots forming in the heart. Anticoagulants are used in these patients to prevent stroke. In the past years, there have been many studies investigating the average effect of traditional and emerging anticoagulant therapies. Much less evidence exists regarding the optimal choice of therapy based on individual patient characteristics. We aim to contribute to the research on methods that enable learning from clinical practice data, as well as to the understanding of optimal anticoagulation of atrial fibrillation patients.","We aim to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects of anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation patients. This will include conducting pairwise comparisons between non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (such as rivaroxaban and apixaban), vitamin K antagonists (such as warfarin), and no anticoagulant treatment. For each patient, an index date is set as the date of anticoagulant therapy initiation following a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. When comparing against no treatment, the index date becomes the date of first diagnosis. The primary outcomes under consideration are stroke and systemic embolism, major bleeding and all-cause mortality within two years of the index date. When therapy discontinuation or therapy switching take place within the follow-up period, the patient is considered lost to follow-up. We choose to use Target Maximum Likelihood learning. This approach is doubly robust if at least one of the treatment and outcome mechanisms is correctly specified. Both probability of treatment and outcome will be modelled using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. Findings will be compared to estimates using the more traditional Cox regression model. Estimates from these observational studies will be compared with those of appropriate patients in existing clinical trials.",Ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism; Major bleeding; All-cause mortality.,"Dr Blanca Gallego Luxan - Chief Investigator - Macquarie University

1616634440-2651,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=3,Use of electronic primary care records to obtain control populations for assessing excess risk of long-term morbidity and mortality in chronic diseases,"As a result of improvements in treatments and management of chronic diseases, patients are now living longer but with a potentially higher risk of developing comorbidities. A large population of patients now live with both cancer and diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels (known as cardiovascular diseases or CVD). There is some evidence that cancer patients have an elevated chance of developing CVD later in life, and conversely treatments and interventions for CVD may increase cancer risk. However, to understand this interplay further control populations without the disease of interest are required so that researchers can ascertain whether morbidity and mortality are in excess of what would be expected for comparable people without the chronic disease.

This project will utilise primary care records to obtain data on control populations without the chronic disease of interest but that share similar characteristics in terms of demographics and other levels of comorbidity. We will exploit the long-term follow-up of these primary care records to estimate the incidence of morbidity and mortality in these people. Our study also has access to population registry data from chronic diseases such as cancer and CVD and therefore the study aims to understand if deaths or long-term morbidity in these data are in excess of what would be expected for comparable people without the chronic disease of interest. Our study will provide resources for other researchers wishing to understand population-level risk and may help to inform health services to target interventions to prevent long-term comorbidity.","There is, now more than ever, an untapped opportunity to utilise disease registry data to address key questions regarding the lifecourse of patients following diagnosis for either cancer or cardiovascular disease stemming from a) continuing increases in scale of registry data, b) longer-term follow-up, and c) possible linkages with other routinely-collected electronic records that record morbidity and mortality.

A key aim of our cardio-oncology research programme at the University of Leicester is to use national registry data to determine whether there are excess rates of morbidity and mortality in chronic disease populations and to understand determinants of variations in excess rates. However, to address such questions, control populations are required so that we can ascertain whether rates of morbidity and mortality are in excess of what would be expected for comparable people without the chronic disease of interest.

This study will utilise data from primary care records from CPRD. The aim will be to produce lifetables with expected mortality and incidence rates stratified by different types and severity of comorbidities. These lifetables can then be fed into other models (e.g. relative survival / excess rate models). However, we first need to ascertain how representative mortality rates are in CPRD compared to the general population. In addition it is important to assess whether selection of specific subject groups impacts on how representative these mortality rates are.

Hence the research will provide a resource for various applied analyses where it is important to ensure expected rates from the reference population represent the rates the exposed (chronic disease) population would have experienced had they been unexposed.

1616634411-2638,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=3,Examining neurologic and thromboembolic risks when using skeletal muscle relaxants with warfarin,"Anticoagulant medicines are used to thin the blood of a patient allowing the blood to flow more easily through the veins. This means that the blood will be less likely to form a dangerous blood clot. Warfarin is a commonly prescribed anticoagulant medicine. Minimizing the likelihood of patient harm associated with anticoagulant therapy is an international patient safety priority. 

People who receive anticoagulant therapy often receive many other prescribed medicines to treat other conditions. A drug-drug interaction is said to have occurred when a drug's effect on the body is changed when it is taken together with a second drug. These interactions can decrease or increase the effect of one or both drugs with potentially harmful consequences. Drug-drug interactions involving anticoagulant therapy are a major, preventable cause of harm. To improve knowledge on anticoagulant safety, the United States (US) Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion issued a call to generate more evidence on anticoagulant drug interactions. 

Potential drug-drug interactions between warfarin and skeletal muscle relaxant drugs have not been investigated in detail to date. We plan to conduct a series of studies to generate evidence on these potential drug-drug interactions. Specifically, we will examine the impact of taking warfarin and individual skeletal muscle relaxant drugs together on rates of venous thromboembolism (a blood clot in the veins) and stroke (both consequences of under-anticoagulation). The findings will generate real-world evidence on these potential interactions that can be used to improve patient safety.","Drug interactions with anticoagulant therapy are a major, preventable cause of harm. To improve knowledge on anticoagulant safety, we plan to conduct bidirectional self-controlled case series studies, among concomitant users of warfarin and a skeletal muscle relaxant and, as pre-specified negative control comparators, among concomitant users of an inhaled corticosteroid and a skeletal muscle relaxant. Each study will examine a composite outcome of venous thromboembolism / ischemic stroke.

Data will be obtained from both CPRD GOLD and CPRD Aurum with linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics and ONS mortality records. The study populations will consist of any individual initiating warfarin (the object drug of interest, the affected agent in a drug interaction pair) and inhaled corticosteroids (the prespecified negative control object drug). Among object drug users, we will define periods of exposure and non-exposure to skeletal muscle relaxants (precipitant drugs, affected agents in a drug interaction pair). We will limit each cohort to individuals experiencing the outcome of interest during their observation period. 

We will dichotomise each day of the observation period as a risk or non-risk day, based on the presence or absence of exposure to a skeletal muscle relaxant. We will use conditional Poisson regression models to estimate incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals and conduct sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our findings and assess potential violations of the self-controlled case series design's underlying assumptions.",#NAME?,"Professor Darren Ashcroft - Chief Investigator - University of Manchester

Some studies suggest that diagnoses of autism in developed countries are increasing: recorded diagnoses of autism in the US rose from 2.2% in 2014 to 2.8% in 2016. The CPRD is the most accurate, complete and representative database available in which to study recording of ASD diagnoses in primary care. 

We will use patient-level data to estimate trends in diagnosis rates over 20 years (1998 - 2018) in several ways.

First, by age group mirroring NICE guidelines for recognition and referral of autism in children and young people: pre-school (0 - 5 years), primary school (6 - 11 years), secondary school (12 - 19 years) with a group to capture the trend in adult diagnosis (over 19 years). 

Second, by functional impairment, using the diagnoses of Asperger's syndrome and infantile autism as proxy measures for high functioning and severe autism respectively. This analysis will capture the influence of changes to diagnostic criteria from the publication of the DSM-5 in 2013. 

Third, by gender: largely an exploratory study of time trends in recognition and recording in primary care broken down by gender.

Data will provide information on the number of recorded diagnoses of ASD in primary care and whether and how diagnosis is increasing over the different age groups to inform policy and planning of services for people with ASD and their families.","The objectives are to explore time trends in the diagnosis of ASD from 1998 to 2018. We are concerned not with absolute prevalence of autism, but of autism diagnosis as recorded in primary care itself. Our focus is on trends in recognition of autism, rather than on autism incidence and prevalence per se.

We will examine ASD using all relevant diagnostic codes (Appendix 1). This study will be largely descriptive, focussed on 'painting a picture' of the current situation revealed by UK primary care data, rather than undertaking detailed comparative analysis or any attempt to define causal links.

Based on available evidence, we anticipate the number of people of any age receiving any ASD diagnosis will be increasing, year on year. 

For separate developmental stages we have separate hypotheses:
1/ That the modal age of diagnosis in the pre-school age group (0 - 5 years) is dropping as awareness of early diagnosis of autism increases and diagnostic tools improve. 

2/ That an increase in diagnosis in the adolescent (12 - 19 years) and adult groups will be largely driven by the increase in diagnoses of AS and HFA. 

3/ In adults (over 19 years) a sharp rise is anticipated in previously undiagnosed Asperger's with a peak after the Autism Act (2009) required all local authorities to provide adult assessment for autism. 

We will also explore the age-distribution of diagnoses to examine whether there are peaks in diagnosis - for example at transition from nursery to primary school (age 4) and to secondary school (age 11). Here difficulties in adjusting to a new environment or new set of expectations will necessitate increased support precipitated by diagnosis.

We hypothesise that diagnoses of HFA will increase more than SA over the twenty years based on findings of a similar US study in 2002.","Percentage (%) of children, adolescents and adults with a new record of an autism diagnoses in each year (1998-2018).

Autism incidence will be obtained by dividing the number diagnosed as autistic by the number with acceptable data in the population. At each age-band (either preschool, child, adolescent or adult) incidence will be the number of patients with a new diagnosis divided by the total number of patients active in the study population in the age-band for that year, a method in common with Taylor et al.

These drugs offer several benefits such as reducing blood sugars, weight loss and lowering of blood pressure. More importantly, they have been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks, stroke, and death. However, there have been concerns that SGLT-2 inhibitors may be associated with breast cancer diagnosed relatively soon after the start of treatment. To date, no real-world study has been conducted to assess this safety question. Thus, we will conduct a large study to determine whether the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of early breast cancer. Our study will provide the necessary information to better assess the risk and benefits of this treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.","Current guidelines recommend sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors as second line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes. SGLT-2 inhibitors act on the kidney to inhibit the sodium-glucose protein 2, thereby allowing the excretion of glucose in the urine (glycosuria) and the lowering of plasma glucose levels. However, the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have raised concerns that certain SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin, have been associated with early breast cancer events in premarketing trials. To date, however, no observational studies have been conducted to assess this possible increased risk in the real-world setting. Thus, to address this concern, we will conduct a large population-based cohort study to assess whether SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of early breast cancer. The study population will consist of women over 40 years of age newly treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Each patient will be followed until a first diagnosis of breast cancer, death from any cause, end of registration with the general practice, or end of study (January 31, 2019). We will use propensity score fine stratification to minimize potential confounding, and Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate the hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) of breast cancer comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors users and DPP-4 inhibitors users.

This group of drugs includes hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic. This drug helps patients lower their blood pressure but may make their skin more sensitive to the sun. Recently, there have been some concerns that patients using hydrochlorothiazide may be at a higher risk of skin cancer. To address this concern, we will conduct a large study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to examine whether patients using hydrochlorothiazide are at a higher risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Because skin cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, results from this study will provide important information on the long-term safety of these drugs.","Antihypertensive drugs are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide, with thiazide diuretics accounting for nearly 30% of these prescriptions. Hydrochlorothiazide is a type of thiazide diuretics with photosensitizing properties. Recently, some observational studies have reported associations with melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. This possible association however warrants further investigation. This is particularly important given that skin cancer has the highest incidence among all cancers. To address this question, we will assemble a cohort of approximately 200,000 patients newly treated with either hydrochlorothiazide or other thiazide diuretics between January 1, 1988 and March 31, 2018, with follow-up until March 31, 2019. Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer comparing hydrochlorothiazide with other thiazide diuretics using propensity score matching and fine stratification. Secondary analyses will assess whether the risk of those cancers varies according to age, sex, and immunosuppressive status.","We will determine all incident melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer events recorded in either the CPRD (determined based on Read codes; see Table A1 in Appendix). Melanoma skin cancer includes 4 main types: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, and acral lentiginous melanoma. Non-melanoma skin cancer includes basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Diagnoses of melanoma skin cancer in the CPRD have been previously validated, with a sensitivity of 77% for melanomas when compared with diagnoses in the UK National Cancer Data Repository.

Progressive supranuclear palsy, also called Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, is an uncommon brain disorder that causes serious problems with walking, balance and eye movements. The disorder results from deterioration of cells in areas of your brain that control body movement and thinking.

Progressive supranuclear palsy worsens over time and can lead to life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia and swallowing problems. There's no cure for progressive supranuclear palsy, so current treatment focuses on managing the signs and symptoms.

Overall Study Aim
The aim of this study is to study a large patient population of PSP patients in order to estimate the clinical burden of this condition, in terms of coexisting medical conditions, and other complications that are known to entail symptoms of this condition.","Background and Purpose of the Study
It is of scientific interest to understand the comorbidities and background rates of a number of clinical events that are known to entail sequelae of PSP within a population of PSP patients. 

Overall Study Aim
To define a cohort of patients with diagnosed PSP and describe the comorbidities, background rate of events, and mortality rates within the cohort, and compare these to those of non-PSP patients.

Study Data / Design
This is a retrospective observational study, using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) supplemented with linkage data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and mortality data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).

Data Analysis
Part of the data analysis will be descriptive in nature: Patient characteristics will be summarized, and person-time incidence rates will be calculated for the clinical events of interest for each year following PSP diagnosis.

It is now well established that symptoms and severity of this condition are major determinants of subsequent higher risk of cardiovascular events (such as heart disease, stroke, heart attack and angina) and death. Most recent estimates suggest that peripheral arterial disease has now reached pandemic proportion, with more than 200 million people living with this condition worldwide. Despite being common and increasing the risk of death, peripheral arterial disease attracts less attention in terms of research, early detection, and treatment. In particular, there is not a lot of information for patients with peripheral arterial disease who underwent recent revascularization procedures to restore blood flow to blocked arteries in terms of frequency of the disease, patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and survival. This study is aimed to estimate the burden of lower extremity revascularization related to peripheral arterial disease in England in terms of characteristics of patients, the incidence of complications, health resource utilization related to complications, and treatment patterns. Additionally, the incidence of revascularization, baseline characteristics, treatment pattern, and risk/incidence of complications will be assessed among subgroups of interest including a subset of patients matching the characteristics of a particular clinical trial.","Two sets of patient cohorts will be needed to answer the study questions. One cohort which will be used to calculate incidence of first-time ever PAD related revascularization (overall and by type of procedure), will include all incident patients diagnosed with PAD above the age of 18 years and registered with a general practice for at least one year.

BID of vaccines are recorded in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database. Depending on its quality, this information could be used to detect administrations of vaccines with high specificity on the vaccine type or brand. Sometimes, manufacturing incidents result in adverse reactions to vaccines. In this context, another use of the recorded BIDs could be the detection and evaluation of safety signals (potential adverse reactions) associated with one or a limited number of batches. We investigated the validity of the reported BIDs in the year 2015 for the GSK vaccines in general and for GSK's rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) in particular by attempting to match with the valid batch numbers issued by GSK for the vaccine shipments to the UK (as available from the Global Industrial Operations (GIO) database internal to GSK).","The aim of this study was to assess the quality of batch numbers of vaccines recorded in the CPRD. 

The quality of the vaccines batch identifiers (BID) recorded in CPRD in 2015 was evaluated for GSK vaccines including Infanrix, Rotarix, Priorix, Menitorix, Boostrix, Nimenrix, Engerix-B, Twinrix/Ambirix, Fluarix QIV, Havrix and others less represented. The analysis matched the valid BID issued by GSK for the vaccine shipments to the UK, as available from the GSK GIO database, to BID recorded in CPRD. 

In a first step, we assessed the quality of the GSK vaccines BIDs recorded in the CPRD database based on the GSK GIO database. Each GSK vaccine product/brand contains a specific four characters prefix in its BID. We computed the proportion of vaccines BIDs recorded in the CPRD that were fully matched to GSK vaccines BIDS among those presenting GSK-specific prefixes. 

In a second step, we computed the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for the detection of Rotarix vaccinations through BIDs, considering Rotarix vaccinations detected through medcodes and immstype as the reference.

Most MS patients experience alternating periods of relapses, i.e. the appearance and disappearance of disease symptoms. Disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) target the immune system to reduce the frequency of relapses and slow the worsening of CNS functioning. MS patients have a higher risk of infection than the general population, and some DMTs that have received market authorization since 2006 are associated with an increased risk of infection. Our primary aim will be to investigate how the occurrence of infections in MS patients has changed over the past 15 years, alongside the changing availability of DMTs. We will investigate the frequency of infections during the year before and the years after MS diagnosis. Our secondary aim is to increase insight in which patient characteristics may predict the risk of infection in MS patients, with particular focus on use of the drugs to treat relapses through their effect on the immune system. The CPRD data will be used to study the numbers of MS patients who experience an infection, and whether they have characteristics related to the number of infections that they experience. The expected benefit of this study is that MS patients and their physicians can make better-informed treatment decisions, and it will provide insights for regulatory authorities into the risk of infections in MS patients.","The aim is to describe the pattern and predictors of infections over the past 15 years in MS patients. A dynamic cohort of MS patients will be studied between January 2003 up until December 2019, who are at least 20 years old and free from malignancy at the moment of recorded diagnosis. In addition, two control groups will be studied with the same age/comorbidity eligibility criteria as above: i) patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ii) a random sample of patients from the general population. The control groups will be matched to the MS cohort on age and sex. We will present annual incidence rates of episodes of infection in the MS cohort, and stratify on sex, age group (20-29 years, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60 and over), and incident/prevalent MS cases. We will perform a regression analysis on the incidence rate of infections during the year before and the years after recorded MS diagnosis for incident cases of MS during the study period. This will be compared to the incidence rates of infection in the two, matched control cohorts. We will also investigate whether associations exist between certain patient characteristics and risk of infection in MS patients. Data on covariates and outcomes are needed: the covariates are various patient characteristics assessed at the time of recorded diagnosis, including current and history of prescribed medicines, and the primary outcome is the incidence rate of episodes of infection per year of follow-up time. To find predictive factors of infection, multivariable analyses will be performed in a Poisson model with the candidate predictor variables as the independent variables and annual incidence rate of infection as the dependent variable. The effect size of each predictive variable will be calculated from its coefficient in the model.","Occurrence of infections of the four major types: urinary tract infection, infection of the pulmonary system, infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and infection of the gastrointestinal system.","Dr Romin Pajouheshnia - Chief Investigator - Utrecht University

These numbers are expected to more than double by 2050. There is currently no cure for dementia. Dementia is caused by different diseases, most commonly by Alzheimer's Disease. There is thus an urgent need to discover effective treatments for Alzheimer's Disease. Numerous biological mechanisms in the human body have been associated with the development and severity of Alzheimer's Disease. This research will examine whether several commonly used medications, that interact with these biological mechanisms, could be protective against Alzheimer's Disease.","There is an urgent need to discover effective treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Original research performed in the Unit of Clinical and Translational Neuroscience at the US National Institute of Aging Intramural Research Program (NIA IRP) has identified several molecular pathways that are associated with the severity of AD pathology in the brain and the expression of clinical symptoms. This research further identified several commonly used medications that interact with these pathways and thus may protect against AD. These medications are currently in use for several non-AD indications. Therefore, hypotheses of a potential protective role of these medications in AD can be tested (strengthened or refuted) using large-scale patient-level data collected during routine health care delivery, such as the CPRD. For each drug of interest, we will implement a new user, active comparator, observational cohort study (section L for a list of the 6 candidate drug/comparator pairs). This design will minimize confounding by indication through comparisons to drugs with a shared indication that do not share interactions with the pathways related to AD. The approach further allows us to capture the effect of drug exposure on dementia risk throughout the treatment course and to address other key biases common to observational studies of prevalent users. For each comparison, propensity scores will be calculated as the predicted probability of initiating the exposure of interest (i.e., the repurposing candidate) versus the reference exposure conditional on baseline patient characteristics using multivariable logistic regression models. Pair matching will be conducted using a nearest-neighbour algorithm. For each comparison, adjusted relative risk estimates will be obtained by computing the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using a Cox proportional hazard regression model in the propensity score matched population.",Alzheimer's disease; vascular dementia; unspecified dementia.,"Dr Tobias Gerhard - Chief Investigator - Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey

Hemophila A is a rare, genetic bleeding disorder, affecting usually males. During the last decades, life expectancy of patients with haemophilia A has improved dramatically. Now these patients are also affected by the presence of additional diseases of aging. The study will examine the coexistence of cardiovascular diseases, using a large healthcare database in the UK.","Today, with the advent of modern treatment modalities , life-expectancy of patients with hemophilia (PWH) has improved dramatically and thus older PWH are not only affected by the comorbidities of hemophilia (arthropathy, consequences of viral infections), but also by the comorbidities associated with aging. However, contemporary population-based data allowing a direct comparison of haemophilia patients with age-matched non-hemophilia patients regarding cardiovascular comorbidity and risk factor profile are currently limited, and the results are inconsistent.

The presently proposed study, using large population-based healthcare databases in the UK and the US, will allow such a direct comparison and thus generate more contextual data to describe the cardiovascular risk and risk factors in patients with haemophilia A. Primary outcomes will be the period prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidity (e.g. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, renal failure, atrial fibrillation and others) in the hemphilia A group compared to the non-hemophilia patients matched for categories of age, GP practice, year of cohort entry. As secondary outcomes overall mortality and cardiovascular mortality will be investigated.

1616634420-2642,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=3,A primary care-based cohort study evaluating the utility of indefinite regular monitoring blood tests in detecting asymptomatic toxicity from long-term methotrexate and leflunomide prescription,"Inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis affects over half-a million people in the UK. They occur due to the body's own defence mechanism i.e. the immune system becoming overactive, and damaging the joints. These conditions are treated with immune-suppressing medicines such as methotrexate and leflunomide that are effective in controlling the arthritis, but, can cause blood, liver or kidney injury. As a result, monitoring blood-tests are performed regularly to identify them early, so that harmful treatment can be discontinued. However, small studies suggest that blood, liver or kidney injury is rare after the first year of treatment. Despite this, regular blood-tests continue for the entire treatment duration, which can be lifelong. 

In this study, we will evaluate the utility of long-term monitoring blood-tests in identifying blood, kidney or liver injury due to tablets such as methotrexate, using anonymous information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Data about people with inflammatory arthritis will be extracted, and, prescription and blood test results obtained from the database. We will estimate the proportion of people reducing or discontinuing treatments such as methotrexate due to abnormal blood test results in the second, and each subsequent year of prescription by a GP. We will develop a risk score to predict people likely to experience these side effects after the first year of treatment, so that monitoring can be targeted to those that are at risk.","Background: Methotrexate and leflunomide are first and second-line treatments for autoimmune rheumatic diseases. They cause idiosyncratic haematological, renal, and hepatic toxicities, and, periodic blood-tests are recommended to identify such abnormalities early, so that potentially toxic drugs can be stopped before they cause damage. Small studies suggest that these abnormalities generally occur within first year of treatment and are uncommon in second year. Similarly, while more frequent monitoring tests are recommended for individuals with co-morbidities, old age etc., there are scant data to support this recommendation, and to identify people likely to benefit from closer monitoring.

Objectives:
 - Estimate proportion discontinuing methotrexate or leflunomide with an abnormal blood-test result, in each 12-month period of prescription.
 - Estimate proportion reducing dose of methotrexate or leflunomide with an abnormal blood-test results, in each 12-month period of prescription.
 - Develop risk prediction score to identify those at risk of drug discontinuation due to abnormal blood-test result after 12-month of treatment.
 - Develop risk prediction score to identify those at risk of dose reduction due to abnormal blood-test result after 12-month of treatment.


Methods: Data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Gold and Aurum will be used. CPRD is an anonymised longitudinal database of UK general practice records, incepted in 1987, and includes data from over 32 million people. It includes information on demographics, lifestyle factors, diagnoses, results of investigations and prescriptions etc. People with autoimmune rheumatic diseases prescribed methotrexate or leflunomide will be ascertained from the time of their first GP prescription, and followed up electronically to estimate the proportion discontinuing or reducing the dose of treatment in each 12-month period in CPRD Gold. Cox-regression will be used to develop a risk prediction score in CPRD Gold. This will be validated in CPRD Aurum excluding any participants who are also in CPRD Gold.","1.

1616634418-2641,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=3,"GARFIELD-AF in Primary care - Optimising prediction of mortality, stroke and major bleeding for patients with atrial fibrillation using routinely collected primary care electronic health records","Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder.  People with AF are five times more likely to have a stroke compared to people without AF.   AF-related strokes are more severe, more disabling and more often cause death.  Many people with AF are prescribed medicines known as anticoagulants, which work to reduce the risk of an AF-related stroke. Unfortunately, anticoagulants also increase the risk of bleeding.

Doctors use two risk scores to help decide whether or not to prescribe anticoagulants to patients with AF: one gives the risk of AF-related stroke and the other gives the risk of major bleeding. However decision-making is not always easy, and many patients who need anticoagulants do not get them, and many patients who do not need anticoagulants are given them.  A new tool, developed from data from a global AF study GARFIELD-AF, predicts the risk of AF-related stroke, bleeding and death in patients with AF.  The aim of our study is to determine how well the GARFIELD-AF tool predicts AF-related stroke, bleeding and death in UK patients using anonymised electronic patient data from CPRD.   

If successful, the tool will be implemented to work with electronic patient records in GP surgeries to help doctors decide who to give anticoagulants, so that all patients who need anticoagulants receive them, and patients who do not need anticoagulants do not receive them.  This will help patients and the NHS by reducing AF-related strokes, deaths and bleeding in patients with AF.","Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common clinically significant arrhythmia in the adult population, increases the risk of stroke five-fold.  AF related strokes are more severe with increased mortality and disability than strokes in people without AF.  Anticoagulation therapy can reduce up to two-thirds of this stroke risk and reduce mortality by up to 25%.  However, anticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding.    Risk scores are therefore used to assess stroke and bleeding risk to guide decisions on anticoagulation, and current NICE guidelines recommend the use of CHA2DS2VASc tool to assess stroke risk and HAS-BLED to assess bleeding risk.  

The GARFIELD-AF tool is a novel risk prediction tool that simultaneously assesses a patients' risk of mortality, AF-related stroke and major bleeding.  It was developed using data from 39,898 patients in the global GARFIELD-AF registry and predicts mortality, stroke and bleeding better than the existing tools.  The GARFIELD-AF tool offers a more accurate and integrated method to facilitate decisions on anticoagulation of patients with AF.  Our study aims to validate the GARFIELD-AF tool using UK electronic primary care records.  

We will use anonymised patient data from the CPRD, linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, and ONS mortality data.  We will include all patients aged >/=18 years with a diagnosis of non-valvar AF with a minimum validated data for one year from date of diagnosis and up to 5 years from diagnosis.  The primary outcome will be death from any cause, first recorded diagnosis of stroke or systemic embolism, or major bleeding within one year of diagnosis.  We will also look at the 2-year and 5-year predictive ability of the tool.

Overall performance, discrimination and calibration will be assessed using the ROC statistic, the D statistic, the R2 statistic, the c-statistic and graphically.","All-cause mortality, Stroke and Systemic embolism, major Bleeding.","Professor David Fitzmaurice - Chief Investigator - University of Warwick

Recent studies have raised concerns that the use of thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics (TZs) as a group, the drug hydrochlorothiazide in particular, is also associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. TZs are mainly used to treat high blood pressure and swelling due to fluid build-up. To increase their effectiveness, TZs are often combined with other blood pressure medications as a single pill. If TZs increased the risk of skin cancer, there would be far-reaching consequences due to their widespread use worldwide. However, data on this potential association are not only limited but also inconsistent. Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we plan to investigate whether patients who take TZs are at an increased risk of developing skin cancer. This study will give doctors and patients more information about the benefits and harms of TZs in order to make informed decisions about their use.","Exposure to thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics (TZs), known as photosensitizing agents, has recently been associated with an increased risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC; in particular of basal cell carcinoma [BCC] and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [SCC]). However, data on this potential association are not only limited but also inconsistent.
We will conduct a cohort study to estimate the absolute and relative risks of CMM, BCC, and SCC in TZs users compared with patients taking a) calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and separately b) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), two other classes of first-line antihypertensive drugs.
We will estimate incidence rates of skin cancer (CMM, BCC, and SCC) in patients with short-term or long-term exposure to TZs as well as in patients with short-term or long-term exposure to a) CCBs and b) RAASi. We will then calculate incidence rate differences (RDs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for several confounders to quantify the risk of skin cancer associated with exposure to TZs, compared with exposure to a) CCBs and b) RAASi.
These data will provide clinicians additional data to weigh the benefits and harms of TZ use in their patients.","Diagnosis (recorded as Read codes) of:

People with PD may experience movement problems like shaking, slowness in movements and rigidity as well as mental and behavioural problems. PD affects one in 100 people over the age of 60. People with PD often have another disease in addition, like disease of the heart or blood vessels, diabetes or dementia. Despite the multiple symptomatic treatments available, a high unmet medical need remains because the treatment becomes less effective over time and due to accumulation of complications. Treatment of PD is highly individualized due to differences in how quick the brain damage and symptoms worsen, differences in response to treatment and differences in severity of movement problems depending on disease stage. Furthermore, treatment guidelines and reimbursement policies differ across regions. The purpose of this study is to describe the current treatments trends in new cases of PD in the UK and to identify factors that are associated with the specific treatment choices.","The study aims to describe the treatment patterns of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in the United Kingdom (UK) and to identify determinants of these treatment patterns. A cohort of patients with PD will be constructed from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data. Incident PD patients with a diagnosis code in CPRD data between 1 January 2007 and 31 March 2018 will be included. Kaplan-Meier estimates will be calculated for time to first symptomatic treatment overall and per treatment class and time to first switch or add-on treatment.

This is the case with studies that explored the effect of medications within a class of treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) called GLP-1 receptor agonists on the risk of heart attack or stroke. Although several of the studies showed that some medications within the class reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke, the studies differed greatly regarding the types of patients that were studied in terms of their underlying risk of heart attack or stroke. The aim of this study is to compare the risk profiles for heart attack and stroke of the participants in the studies mentioned with the risk profiles for heart attack and stroke of the T2D population in UK general practice. This will determine the extent to which the results of each of those studies can be applied to the UK T2D population.","The aim of the study is to determine the extent to which patients with T2D enrolled into the REWIND, LEADER and SUSTAIN-6 Cardiovascular Outcome Trials (CVOTs) are representative, from a CV profile perspective, of T2D patients in UK routine clinical practice.

1616634423-2643,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=3,Comparison of the prevalent new user and active comparator new user designs for assessing the real-world safety and effectiveness of medications,"Investigating the real-world safety and effectiveness of medications is an important, post-licensing, stage of drug development. These studies give us more in-depth knowledge, especially surrounding the long-term and rare effects of medications, and help us to characterise patient experiences outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial. Frequently, we will want to compare users of a newly licensed drug to users of an older drug which is prescribed for similar reasons. 

Traditionally, studies of this type are designed as follows. We identify a population of patients who have no prior usage of the two drugs and compare initiators of the newer drug to initiators of the older drug. Patients are then followed up and the risk of a particular outcome compared between the two groups.  

However, this approach excludes a large number of initiators of the newer drug that previously received the older drug. This can lead to concerns surrounding the representativeness of the study population compared to the usage of the drugs in practice. A recently proposed study design aims to address this limitation and explicitly accounts for patients who switch from the older drug to the newer drug. 

In this study, we will provide an assessment of the results obtained from the traditional design against variations of the newly developed study design. This will help to inform us of the potential for this design to be used in future studies.","The active comparator new user (ACNU) study design has become the gold-standard for conducting cohort studies to assess the real-world safety and effectiveness of medications 1. The attractiveness of the ACNU approach is largely due to the baseline washout period (mimicking a clinical trial) and using an active comparator to reduce confounding by indication. 

However, one issue with the ACNU is the selection of a suitable comparator drug. Often the comparator is an older drug that has been on the market for a long time. In the patient population, this means that many new users of the study drug are not, in fact, treatment naive but have instead switched to the newer drug from the old comparator. The ACNU would typically exclude those who switched from the comparator drug to the study drug and this can result in investigators mischaracterising the real world patient population. The newly proposed Prevalent New User (PNU) design aims to address this limitation by incorporating patients who have switched from the older drug to the newer drug.  

In this study, we aim to provide an assessment of the PNU design and proposed variations of defining exposure sets compared to the existing ACNU design. Furthermore, we will investigate the use of high-dimensional propensity scores (hd-PS) for confounder adjustment in the context of PNU designs and provide initial guidance to investigators planning to combine these approaches.","This is a methodological study.

We intend to look at how frequently general practitioners are measuring common liver blood tests. We would expect the numbers to be rising given the increase in disease and the focus on the liver as a priority disease for early diagnosis. 
Firstly, we plan to use general practice data (CPRD) to determine how often a number of different liver blood tests are measured and how this has changed over time.
Secondly we plan to look as see if these tests are performed more frequently in patients known to be at high risk of liver disease - people with type 2 diabetes, obesity or excess alcohol consumption. 
The results will help us decide if it would be possible to integrate advanced liver blood testing and screening for liver disease into UK general practice. Guiding the future healthcare of patients.","Overall aim: 
To understand the temporal changes in individual liver function testing over the period 1997 to most recent in UK general practice in order to inform potential screening practices.

Methodology: 
We will determine the prevalence of blood marker testing in the adult UK population over time for each of the following assays using CRPD: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, albumin and platelet count. Results will be stratified by subgroups of the population with or at high risk of chronic liver disease: type 2 diabetes, obesity, alcohol excess. We will also determine the frequency of abnormal results.
Annual prevalence rates for each marker will be determined by extracting laboratory measures or READ codes from the linked clinical file to determine their levels.
Subgroups will be determined using validated READ codes.
Temporal trends in marker testing using age and sex standardised rates of each test use will be analysed using a join point regression to look for statistically significant changes in rates of marker testing use over the study period and to determine change points in the trends.

In a time of emerging treatment options that may offer benefits to patients with HF, there is an increasing need to understand the size of the problem, characteristics of patients affected and the impact of the choice of medications used to treat these patients in clinical practice. Work to date include clinical trial studies in patients with and without diabetes who already have established heart and blood vessel diseases. The results from the studies are very encouraging and show the treatment reduced the progression of HF. However, as only limited number of people can be enrolled in trials due to the rigorous selection criteria, the findings may not be generalised across all populations. There are very few contemporary reports on the characteristics and outcomes of HF that have investigated specific subgroup populations, particularly people whose heart in not able to pump enough blood in each heartbeat. In addition, the role of new therapies that may offer benefits to patients to patients with HF is yet to be explored, including treatment adherence and how the disease progression may increase risks of adverse complications, death and healthcare cost in these patients.

1616634399-2633,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=3,Real World Effectiveness and Adverse Events Caused by ACE inhibitors and ARBs for Reduction in Cardiovascular Events,"Patients with conditions of the heart or blood vessels or those with diabetes with complications are at greater risk of cardiovascular related death, heart attack (myocardial infarction), stroke and hospitalisations for heart failure. 

Medications to reduce the risk of such cardiovascular events are prescribed based upon evidence from clinical trials which explore treatment effects in a sample of the general population. However, this sample is often not representative of the entire population. Therefore, the effectiveness of medications on groups underrepresented in clinical trials such as those over 75 years or from ethnic minority backgrounds is often unknown.

One of the most commonly prescribed types of medication given to patients at high risk of cardiovascular events are angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), which reduce blood pressure but can cause serious side effects. Based upon results including those from a landmark study (the ONTARGET/TRANSCEND trial) angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are often now prescribed instead of ACE inhibitors, as in the trials these were shown to perform as well as ACE inhibitors and cause fewer side effects.

Anonymised information routinely collected during general practice (GP) and hospital appointments will be used in this study to assess the effects of ARBs compared to ACE inhibitors, and a combination of the two. First, we will see how well each treatment works when prescribed to people that are similar to those included in the ONTARGET/TRANSCEND trials. Then we will see how well the treatments work when prescribed to patient groups excluded or underrepresented in these trials.","We will use HES linked CPRD data to select patients prescribed ACE inhibitors, ARBs or both and from this select those that are thought to be at high risk of cardiovascular events, i.e. those with coronary, peripheral or cerebrovascular disease or diabetes with end-organ damage. We will then create a population in CPRD with similar characteristics to the ONTARGET/TRANSCEND trial population by applying their inclusion/exclusion trial criteria. We will use multivariable Cox regression to calculate the absolute and relative rates/risks (whichever is more appropriate) for the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke or hospitalisation for congestive heart failure and also the secondary and safety outcomes. 

The analysis will be repeated after having applied a matching technique, such as propensity score matching, to ensure that patients in the two comparison groups from both the CPRD cohort and the randomised trials are similar, which we have approved access to anonymised individual participant data. If the absolute and relative rates/risks from analysis of the matched cohort are similar to those from applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria this will suggest that matching has no additional benefit in replicating a clinical trial in this specific therapeutic area. 

Either using the CPRD trial-analogous cohort, or a matched cohort (if shown to be important), we will extend the analysis to subgroups that were underrepresented in the trials (adjusting the inclusion/exclusion criteria as necessary) such as those aged >75 years, from ethnic minority groups or with poor renal function. We will use a variety of modelling approaches to determine how to expand the population of trial-underrepresented subgroups within the CPRD population. However, if matching does have an effect in replicating the trial it will also be used here. Finally, we will observe the outcomes over a longer time period than studied in the clinical trial.","The outcomes are listed below, based on the outcomes from the ONTARGET/TRANSCEND trials.

 - Primary outcome: Cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke or hospitalisation for congestive heart failure

It is a major cause of cardiovascular disorders and can lead to kidney disease, damage of nerves, and damage of the retina. Retinal damage due to diabetes is known as diabetic retinopathy. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues are relatively new and effective second-to-third line antidiabetic drugs, which can decrease blood sugar levels via stimulating insulin secretion in the pancreas. While they have been found to reduce heart disease risks, there is some evidence from recent clinical trials that they could also increase the risk of diabetic retinopathy. To date, no real-world studies have been conducted on this important safety question. Therefore, this study will determine whether the use of GLP-1 analogues is related to an increase in the risk of diabetic retinopathy using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. To do so, we will compare the number of patients with retinopathy who are taking GLP-1 analogues to the number of patients with retinopathy who are taking oral antidiabetic drug combination therapy. The findings of this study will help us modify retinal screening programmes to better monitor patients with type 2 diabetes who are treated with GLP-1 analogues.","Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues are effective second-to-third line antidiabetic drugs. Recently, they showed a higher incidence of retinopathy compared to placebo in clinical trials. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine whether the use of GLP-1 analogues is associated with an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. For this purpose, a cohort of type 2 diabetes patients with no history of retinopathy and newly treated with a noninsulin antidiabetic drug between January 1, 2007 and September 30, 2015 will be assembled. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for diabetic retinopathy (defined via outpatient or inpatient diagnoses) associated with current use of GLP-1 analogues, compared to current use of 2 or more oral antidiabetic drugs. Secondary analyses will assess whether there is a duration- or drug-specific-response relationship between current use of GLP-1 analogues and risk of diabetic retinopathy, and whether duration of treated type 2 diabetes modifies the association.",Diabetic retinopathy.,"Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

A new vaccine against meningitis B was introduced into the UK routine childhood vaccination programme in September 2015. As with many vaccines, the new meningitis B vaccine may cause fevers in infants in the days following vaccination. There is evidence however that the new vaccine may cause more and higher fevers than other vaccines. A high fever due to infection or a vaccine carries a risk of a fit/seizure in infants and small children. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible risk of fits/seizures in infants following vaccination with the meningitis B vaccine by comparing trends of fits/seizures following vaccination both before and after the meningitis B vaccine was added to the routine vaccination programme. Additionally the study will evaluate whether inclusion of the new vaccine alongside the other well established vaccines is having any impact on uptake or delaying infants/parents returning to have their second and third doses of the meningitis vaccine or the other routine vaccines. The results of this study will provide valuable information on the safety of the new meningitis B vaccine.","The objectives of this study are firstly to investigate a potential risk of convulsions following vaccination with Men B vaccine in an ecological analysis by comparing incidence rates of convulsions following routine vaccination before and after the introduction of the Men B vaccine into the routine schedule. Age-specific incidence rates of convulsion following routine vaccination at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 12 months of age in the 5 years prior to and 14 months after the introduction of Men B vaccine will be determined. Poisson regression analysis will assess temporal trends before and after the introduction of Men B vaccine. The second objective is to evaluate whether the introduction of the Men B vaccine is having an impact on infants/parents returning for subsequent doses on time. Timing of vaccination will be investigated for all 3 doses of Men B vaccine at 8, 16 weeks and 12 months, rotavirus vaccine at 8 and 12 weeks and pneumococcal vaccine at 8, 16 weeks and 12 months in time periods prior to and after the introduction of Men B vaccine.

Substantial differences in patients' characteristics, patient management and outcomes during hospitalisation of HF patients are known to exist between the Western and the Asian countries. However, the studies are limited by middle-sized datasets of HF patients and based on indirect comparisons. Simultaneous access to individual patient-level data in large-scale nationwide databases would enable the outcomes and the treatment strategy of patients with similar attributes in the UK and Japan to be compared rather than merely comparing averages based on previous published papers.

Prolonged use of OCS has been linked to increased risk of conditions such as diabetes, and high blood pressure. Research by the Observational and Pragmatic Research Institute (OPRI) in patients with lung disease and diabetes showed that inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy may have a negative impact on diabetes control, and that patients given increasing doses of ICS could face a higher risk of diabetes progression. However, previous studies on OCS use did not explore the effects of prolonged exposure in large patient populations, and did not provide specific OCS doses at which the risk of additional disease occurrence significantly increased.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of long-term OCS exposure, average total daily dose, total duration of exposure and current OCS exposures on disease onset, burden and healthcare resource utilisation, over a minimum two-year timescale, in a broad patient population and in a subgroup of patients with asthma. Studying the effects of long-term exposure to oral corticosteroids in a broader patient population will help to show whether OCS has any side effects on populations presenting various conditions.","Long term use of oral corticosteroids (OCS) has been associated with increased risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes, osteoporosis, hypertension and cataracts. Previous research found an association between OCS use and morbidity among patients with severe asthma. Research by the Observational and Pragmatic Research Institute (OPRI) in patients with COPD and comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus suggested that inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy may have a negative impact on diabetes control and that patients prescribed higher cumulative doses of ICS may be at greater risk of diabetes progression. However, previous studies examining OCS use did not explore the effects of long term total exposure in a broader patient population, and did not provide specific OCS doses where the risk of comorbid disease onset significantly increased.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of long-term OCS exposure defined as: the total dose (g); categorised into courses per year, average total daily dose (mg/day) and total duration of exposure and current OCS exposures on disease onset, burden and healthcare resource utilisation (HRU) over a minimum two-year timescale in a broad patient population and also in a subgroup of patients with asthma.

Different time-dependent OCS exposure measures will be explored. For each corticosteroid-related condition, multivariable Cox proportional hazard models will be fitted separately for each of the time-dependent OCS exposure measures. We will explore the independent predictive ability of each exposure measure in the models.  To determine critical OCS dose thresholds, total dose and daily dose will be categorised into relevant levels, and the risk of developing the outcome of interest will be compared between corticosteroid arm and control arm.

Several small studies suggest that they have a weaker immune response and may derive less protection from standard-dose seasonal flu vaccines. The purpose of this study is to examine whether standard-dose seasonal flu vaccine reduces their risk of developing seasonal flu and its complications. We will also examine whether administration of flu vaccine causes a flare of arthritis, whether the proportion of arthritis patients receiving the seasonal flu vaccine has increased over the last 10 years, and if some regions of the UK perform poorly in vaccinating this at-risk population. For this study we will identify arthritis patients on immune suppressing treatments and find out if they have received the flu vaccine yearly between 2006 and 2016. They will be divided into two groups depending on whether they received the flu vaccine. The rates of flu, chest infection, hospital admission for chest problems, and death in the flu season will be compared between the groups. The proportion of patients receiving the seasonal flu vaccine in each year and in different parts of UK will be calculated.","Objectives: (1) To examine whether vaccination with seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (STIV) reduces the
incidence of influenza like illness and lowers respiratory tract infection, exacerbation of chronic obstructive airway

Design: Primary care based cohort study using data from the CPRD.
Study period: 01/09/2006-31/08/2016.
Methodology: Unadjusted GP consultation and hospital admission rate ratios for each outcome and mortality rate ratio will be calculated. This will be adjusted for the propensity of being vaccinated. Adjusted illness and mortality hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated, and used to compute vaccine effectiveness. Rates of vaccination will be calculated for each year and region and will be stratified by age and AIRD type.

Warfarin is a medicine also used to treat blood clots and to prevent strokes, but it can cause problems for some patients. It needs ongoing blood tests and can cause bleeding - such as vomiting or coughing up blood - which may need hospital care or even be fatal.

Some new anticoagulants, which may not need blood tests, now exist, but they are quite expensive.  It is also unclear how safe these treatments will be in the longer term since the original trials were done over relatively short periods of time (only up to 2 years) and because trials were done using selected patients, who may be different from patients in real world settings. We need, therefore, to research the safety of the new anticoagulants when compared with the older ones over longer periods of time and in normal clinical practice. Because of their novelty, the drugs are not widely prescribed and the adverse effects are also rare. Their study will require a very large number of patient records - available only from routinely-collected primary care data.","Objective:
The study will compare in patients prescribed different types of novel anticoagulant drugs (NOAC) the risks of major bleeding requiring hospitalisation with those in patients prescribed warfarin.

Methods:
This will be a cohort study following patients who received anticoagulant prescription (NOAC or warfarin) between 1 September 2008 and 1 September 2016. We will use new-user design so patients with anticoagulant prescriptions in the previous 12 months will be excluded. Outcomes will be hospitalisations and deaths identified from HES and ONS mortality data. Primary outcomes will include gastrointestinal and intracranial bleed.  Secondary outcomes will include ischaemic stroke and venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Analysis:
Exposure to different NOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban) will be compared with exposure to warfarin using a Cox regression analysis.

Their journey begins by consulting their GP but patients still take varied routes after developing symptoms. Available treatments range from pain killers and physiotherapy to joint replacement surgery.

Across the UK the treatments and models of care vary widely and patients may be unable to access some treatments based on where they live. National guidelines have been published about which treatments the NHS should offer, and that surgery should only be used if non-surgical treatments have failed. However, it remains unclear which pathway is best for patients, or most cost effective for the NHS. It is uncertain whether some patient groups (e.g. older people or those living in poorer areas) are less likely to be offered surgery.

This study aims firstly to describe patients' pathways from first GP presentation until definitive treatment. Secondly, we will investigate the hypothesis that treatment pathways differ according to patients' characteristics such as age or where they live. Thirdly, in those undergoing surgery, we will investigate the hypothesis that timing and duration of pathways affects surgical outcomes.","Objective
To identify patients that undergo hip and knee replacements and describe the treatment pathways taken to identify whether there is any variation according to patient characteristics (age, sex, social class, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, medications, smoking status etc.) and geographical region. We further aim to investigate whether the treatment pathway and its' duration affects the outcome of hip or knee replacement surgery.

Methods
determine whether they change as patients progress through the pathway.
b.	Describe whether patient characteristics and geographical region are associated with timing to receive treatments, and further describe variations according to whether or not patients receive both surgical and non-surgical treatments.
3.	Does the duration or pattern of treatment pathway prior to referral to a surgeon affect patient outcomes of surgery?
a.	In patients that ultimately received hip or knee replacement surgery, do differences in the treatments offered during the pathway affect patient outcomes of surgery?
b.	In patients that ultimately received hip or knee replacement surgery, does the duration of the treatment pathway affect patient outcomes of surgery?
c.	Are there any definable patient characteristics or regional variations that influence the outcome of treatment?

Rationale
OA is one of the most common diseases worldwide. It is a chronic, progressive, disabling disease with many factors influencing its development and progression. Relatively little is still known about how patient experiences and socioeconomic status effects access to care and outcome of treatment. Further understanding the referral patterns and different routes of access to care for OA patients and their wider characteristics can inform, and enhance","-	Mortality	-	PROMS	-	Failure / Revision surgery

Intramedullary nailing is the most frequent surgical treatment for tibial shaft fractures. In patients with tibial shaft fractures, infection is an important complication as about 15% of these fractures are open injuries. Such infections may lead to devastating consequences such as increase in length of hospital stay, readmissions, prolonged medication treatment and reoperations along with high use of medical resources and costs.

It is given to girls aged 12/13 years in order to protect against the human papillomavirus - the leading cause of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under the age of 35. There have been a number of side effects reported for the type of vaccine used from 2012 (Gardasil). These include complex regional pain syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and symptoms associated with autonomous nervous systems (ANS) disorders. However, the evidence from recent systematic reviews suggests that there is no association between these outcomes and the HPV vaccine. The best type of study to examine the effects of a drug on patients are randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where patients are given either the HPV Vaccine or a placebo (a dummy drug that will have no effect) but they do not know which one they are taking. A number of RCTs have been performed before and after the licensing of the vaccine but extensive media attention prevails suggesting adverse effects. RCTs of the vaccine cannot be done now as the vaccine is widely given. It would also need to be very large in size in order to detect differences in rare outcomes, and hence would be expensive and time-consuming. We will be using a statistical method called regression discontinuity analysis (RDA) which allows us to be able to determine whether the vaccine has any potential adverse effect without the need for additional RCTs.","Evidence surrounding the safety of HPV vaccines is reassuring despite extensive media attention suggesting otherwise. We will use a regression discontinuity analysis (RDA) to assess the effect of the HPV vaccine on suggested adverse outcomes. RDA is a statistical technique that allows for causal inference when a decision rule (such as being above or below a cut-off value on a continuous measure) is used to assign treatment. It is a quasi-experimental method that (like RCTs) reduces the effect of confounding of unobserved variables. The assumption being that patients lying just either side of the cut-off value are similar, in terms of observed and unobserved characteristics. Focussing on a small window surrounding the cut-off value should result in treatment assignment being the only difference between patients. Our study sample will be comprised of 12-13-year-old girls born in July through October in each year 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 who have one year of follow up data. We will use date of birth as exposure, comparing girls in the school year that the vaccine is given with those in the school year prior.

In asthma, high eosinophil counts indicate more severe disease, and could be used to predict future symptom levels or asthma attacks. Less is known about the use of eosinophil measurement in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but recent findings suggest a very similar role in the burden of disease in a substantial proportion of patients. COPD is associated with high hospital use: in particular, patients may suffer from 'exacerbations', when symptoms, such as chest tightness and shortness of breath, rapidly become worse. Exacerbations often require admission to hospital, contributing to the high annual healthcare costs of COPD. Furthermore, one in five patients is estimated to be readmitted to hospital within 30 days, despite extensive drug treatment to prevent exacerbations. Knowing which patients are at most risk is highly useful if COPD management is to be improved. As with asthma, this risk could be indicated with a high eosinophil count. This study will examine a large sample of UK patients with COPD, with high and normal eosinophil counts, in terms of their exacerbation rates and healthcare costs.","Objectives: 1. To study whether patients admitted to hospital for COPD exacerbation are more likely to be re-admitted if their pre-admission blood eosinophil counts (BEC) is high 2. To compare COPD-related health care resource use (HRU) and costs of patients who are at risk of exacerbations while on triple therapy, with that of average COPD patients 3. To study whether high BEC are associated with greater costs and explore other accessible factors that may drive costs Methods: Patients will be characterised in a baseline year prior to index date (ID). Objective 1: The risk of COPD-related re-admission to hospital within 4 and 52 weeks after ID will be compared for patients with and without high eosinophil counts.

Objectives 2/3: HRU and costs- total, and broken down by type of utilisation - will be estimated, stratified by smoking status, in a follow-up year after ID.

Combinations of three medications (triple therapy) are often recommended to control symptoms. Patient response to treatment is related to how well they take their medication as recommended (known as adherence). However, little is currently known about the course of treatments patients may take before triple therapy (treatment pathways), how this relates to adherence, and the effect on the patient's health. 

This study aims to understand the type of treatment COPD patients may receive. As COPD symptoms worsen, medications prescribed are likely to change. Patients may also seek advice or care from their GP or hospital when experiencing symptoms, which will also be examined. Treatment changes and lab tests relevant to COPD will also be described. Results from this study will give insight into factors influencing treatments for COPD.","This study will examine pathways to triple therapy in COPD and how patient factors (such as exacerbations and symptom score) influence treatment pathways. Adherence will be assessed and evaluated in relation to exacerbation and healthcare resource utilisation. Changes in therapy and eosinophil levels will also be ascertained. COPD cases, approximate disease severity, symptom score, and exacerbations will be identified from proxy indicators due to known issues relating to data completeness[1,2].

The number and proportion of patients on triple therapy and on distinct pathways will be determined. Time to first prescription will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and reported as cumulative proportions alongside the survival curve. The influence of factors (number of exacerbations, symptom score, lung function, phenotype) on choice of pathway leading to triple therapy will be initially explored using bivariate analyses (e.g., comparisons of means, medians or proportions as appropriate between different pathways).  A multinomial logistic regression model may be employed as a multivariable analysis of factors predicting pathways. The analysis of pathways of stepping down from triple therapy after initiation will include proportion (%) with 95% confidence intervals and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of time to stepping down.",#NAME?,"Dr Joseph Kim - Chief Investigator - IQVIA - UK

Identification and Referral to Improve Safety (IRIS) is a training for general practitioners (GPs) aiming at flagging patients with signs of DVA, asking them about abuse and referring those who disclosed to the local DVA service. Limited evidence from a Domestic Homicide Review and three foreign studies suggest that a request for the 'morning-after pill' may indicate DVA, because perpetrators persuade women to have unprotected sex or commit rape. Although the 'morning-after pill' can be bought at pharmacies, most socially disadvantaged women obtain the free pill through GPs. Up to a third of all the 'morning-after pills' are provided by GPs. To strengthen the limited evidence on the link between DVA and use of the 'morning-after pill', we propose to analyse patient records from ~8% of UK GP practices to establish whether women with a prescription for the ""morning-after pill"" are more likely to have a DVA record compared to women without the prescription. If we find a link, we will update IRIS training and extend it to other providers of the 'morning-after pills'.","Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is a public health and clinical problem which adversely affects women's health. IRIS is a national training, support and referral programme for GPs built upon clinical enquiry among patients with signs and symptoms of DVA (case-finding). A recent Domestic Homicide Review and rapid literature review have suggested that request for emergency contraception may be a new indicator of woman's exposure to DVA. However, such limited evidence is not sufficient to amend the existing IRIS training. It is therefore important to obtain evidence from the UK population. Currently, community pharmacies, general practices and community reproductive health clinics are the main sources of emergency contraception in the UK. Up to a third of all emergency contraceptive pills are prescribed by GPs. We propose to use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to examine the association between prescription(s) of emergency contraception and preceding exposure to DVA. If we identify that those women who are prescribed emergency contraception are more likely to be exposed to DVA than those who do not have the prescription, we will add the new evidence to the IRIS training and extend it to all core providers of emergency contraception.",Prescription of emergency contraception; Frequency of prescription of emergency contraception.,"Natalia Lewis - Chief Investigator - University of Bristol

Lower respiratory infections include illnesses like acute bronchitis, pneumonia and lung abscesses, where an infection in one part of the lung causes a build-up of pus. We use 'acute' to mean a new illness that comes on quickly rather than an illness that patients have for weeks, months or longer. When a patient has one of these illnesses, they usually have shortness of breath, weakness, fever, coughing and extreme tiredness. We think that antibiotics may also be used too often to treat ALTRI in people with asthma. It might also be the case that doctors are using medicine for asthma to treat non-asthmatic patients with ALRTI. We would like to find out: 
1. the patterns of antibiotics and asthma medication given to adults without asthma and young people with ALRTI. 
2. whether adults and young people with asthma are more likely to get antibiotics for an ALRTI than people without asthma. 
The information we find out will help us design a research study to lessen the amount of unnecessary antibiotics given to patients with asthma.","British Thoracic Society asthma guidelines recommend that treatment for acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) in asthmatics should be a 'step-up' in asthma-medication and not antibiotics. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that simultaneous prescriptions of antibiotics is extremely common, but little is known about the precise treatment patterns of ALRTI among asthmatics in primary care in the UK. We will investigate GPs prescribing patterns of antibiotics and asthma-medication in over 100,000 patients aged 12 years and older who were diagnosed with an ALRTI in 2014 and 2015. We will investigate whether asthmatics were more or less likely to be prescribed antibiotics compared to non-asthmatics. Multivariable regression will be used to model the association between asthmatic status and antibiotic and asthma-medication use. Furthermore, we will investigate whether practice (e.g. geographic), GP and patient-level (e.g. age, sex, and ALRTI and antibiotic prescription history) factors influence the association using mixed-effect regression models. Results from this study will provide an insight into the prescribing of antibiotics for ALRTI amongst asthmatics, and identify potential factors that may be associated with sub-optimal management.

The main complaints of patients with COPD are breathlessness and a productive cough. Individuals who suffer from COPD often have periods where their symptoms worsen. These periods of worsening (called exacerbations) can sometimes be linked to high levels of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the body. Some adults with severe COPD continue to experience exacerbations even while treated with the maximum therapy - a combination of three, long-acting inhaled medications known as 'triple therapy'. Mepolizumab is a new treatment currently being evaluated in clinical trials which may help to reduce exacerbations in individuals with high levels of eosinophils. This study will use anonymised electronic medical records to identify a group of COPD patients who may be considered eligible for mepolizumab treatment and then measure how frequently they experience exacerbations, how often they visit their GP or are admitted to hospital, and how many of them die. The results from this study will be used to assess the potential benefit of mepolizumab treatment in patients with very severe COPD by placing the results of the ongoing clinical trials into context of the real world.","This retrospective cohort study aims to generate evidence needed to better understand severe COPD patients who could benefit from therapies which reduce eosinophils such as mepolizumab. Treatment eligibility will be considered in COPD-diagnosed patients who meet all the following criteria: history of moderate or severe exacerbations of COPD; treatment with inhaled triple maintenance therapy for COPD; and, raised peripheral blood eosinophil levels (>150cells/µL). Ascertainment of eligibility will take place on the date of first valid eosinophil test recorded between 2010-2014 (the index date). Using CPRD-GOLD data linked with HES-APC data, we will describe demographic and clinical characteristics of eligible and non-eligible patients [Objective 1]. We will then estimate rates for eligible and non-eligible patients of clinical burden of illness and healthcare resource utilisation outcomes in the period after the index date [Objective 2]. Outcomes include: moderate/severe exacerbations, all-cause mortality, primary-care consultations and unplanned, non-COPD-related hospitalisations. Finally, we will compare rates of outcomes in eligible and non-eligible patients using multivariable regression modelling (Poisson, Cox or negative binomial, as appropriate) [Objective 3]. In further stratified analyses we will limit our study population to three subsets of patients meeting the exacerbation, inhaled triple therapy, and raised eosinophil level criteria.","The following clinical burden of illness outcomes will be assessed using all available patient follow-up after the index date. - Rate of AECOPD expressed as the number of AECOPD per 1,000 person-years of follow-up. All exacerbations occurring during following will be included in the numerator, while the denominator will include all follow-up time after the index date. Exacerbations will be defined using validated algorithms described earlier (Rothnie, 2015; Rothnie, 2016). We will report AECOPD in the following groups: moderate, severe, and 'moderate or severe'. - Rate of all-cause mortality, where deaths are defined using the date of death as recorded in CPRD-GOLD. The rate will be expressed as the number of deaths per 1,000 person-years at risk, where follow-up time for the denominator will end on the date of death. The following healthcare resource utilization outcomes will be assessed for the sub-population of patients with at least 12 months of follow-up after their index date. Rates of outcomes are calculated using a numerator that includes all consultations/hospitalisations occurring within the 12 month period after the index date. The denominator for all rates will be the number of patients. - Annual rate of primary-care consultations, expressed per 1,000 patients. All the non-administrative, primary-care consultations, occurring on separate days will be captured in the numerator for this outcome. An algorithm will classify primary-care consultations as GP consultations or nurse consultations using the 'staffrole' and 'constype' variables in CPRD-GOLD. -Annual rate of non-COPD-related, unplanned and unscheduled hospitalisations, expressed per 1,000 patients. Hospitalisations will be identified using HES-APC data. The numerator will include all unplanned admissions in the 12 months after the index date where the primary reason for admission is not for COPD and is not related to an AECOPD by other definitions of severe exacerbations. Each new spell will be considered as a new admission. Episodes within a spell will not be considered as new hospitalisations. The admimeth flag will be used to identify unplanned/unscheduled admissions (values 21, 22, 23, 24, and 28).","Dr Hana Mullerova - Chief Investigator - Astra Zeneca Ltd - UK Headquarters

When the liver is too scarred to function properly, we speak of liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis may lead to liver failure and/or liver cancer. Several conditions can cause cirrhosis, two of which are chronic infection with hepatitis B virus, and the building-up of fat in the liver, also called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is often associated with other metabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity.
The aim of this study is to understand if infection with hepatitis B virus causes patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD to develop cirrhosis more often or faster than those who are not infected with this virus. 
Liver cirrhosis is a very serious condition that can require liver transplantation or lead to premature death. Preventing or slowing its development can be beneficial to patients at high risk. The results of this study will help evaluate if infection with hepatitis B virus increases the risk, or speed of liver disease progression, and therefore support prevention of Hepatitis B infection in a population already at increased risk.","Both Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can cause liver damage. There is a lack of data on the role of HBV infection in the progression of liver disease in diabetic patients with NAFLD. 
The main research question is: does HBV-infection increase the risk of development of, or accelerate the progression to, NAFLD-related stages in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)? 
We propose a cohort study based on health-records of the CPRD population eligible for linkage with HES Admitted Patient Care, from 2000 to the latest CPRD release available at the time of the analyses. Three cohorts will be compared: subjects with T2DM and HBV-infection, subjects with T2DM and without HBV-infection, and T2DM-free subjects with HBV-infection. Due to underdiagnoses of NAFLD, and the high proportion of NAFLD in subjects with T2DM, T2DM will be used as a proxy for NAFLD exposure. Subjects with a history of liver disease unrelated to HBV infection or NAFLD will be excluded. We will look at descriptive data, calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using a Poisson regression model, and explore diseases progression in a time-to-event analysis. The latter models will be adjusted for covariates and sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess and minimise the impact of potential confounders.","NAFLD-related cirrhosis
The primary outcome NAFLD-related cirrhosis is defined, for the purpose of this study, as cirrhosis for which no other cause was identified. The definition is therefore implemented by exclusion, namely as cirrhosis of other aetiology than those defined as study exclusion criteria (alcoholic liver disease, alcoholism, autoimmune liver disease, any viral hepatitis other than HBV, liver transplantation, liver cancer, hemochromatosis, liver failure). The date of onset will be the date of earliest evidence of any cirrhosis. Preliminary code lists for cirrhosis, including those part of the exclusion criteria, are available in the Appendix 2.
Liver fibrosis, non-alcoholic hepatocellular carcinoma
For exploratory aim 5 and 6 non-alcoholic liver fibrosis and non-alcoholic hepatocellular carcinoma are defined as fibrosis or hepatocellular carcinoma of other aetiology than those defined as study exclusion criteria (alcoholic liver disease, alcoholism, autoimmune liver disease, any viral hepatitis other than HBV, liver transplantation, hemochromatosis, liver failure). The date of onset will be the date of earliest evidence of any fibrosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Preliminary code lists for non-alcoholic fibrosis and non-alcoholic hepatocellular carcinoma are available in the Appendix 2.
Outcome definition algorithm performance
A subset of maximum 100 NAFLD-related cirrhosis cases identified in Cohorts 1 to 3 will be selected at random and ascertained through subject profile review, by two independent reviewers, including all available clinical, therapy, and laboratory test recorded in CPRD, to insure the performance of the NAFLD-related cirrhosis classification algorithm. The positive predictive value of the NAFLD-related cirrhosis classification algorithm and the inter-reviewer agreement will be estimated. Based on the positive predictive value, if lower than 90%, case definitions may be refined and additional sensitivity analyses will be performed. Two P95 clinical reviewers (Anke Stuurman, Germano Ferreira) will do the case profile review and Thomas Verstraeten will resolve any disagreement; Prof Yves Horsmans will be consulted in case of the need for further clinical expert adjudication.","Dr Germano Ferreira - Chief Investigator - Not from an Organisation

Around 10-40% of people with type 2 diabetes eventually suffer from kidney failure. 
Good control of blood sugar levels could prevent complications of diabetes including kidney disease, although the level of blood sugar at which kidney function starts to decline is not known, and people with high blood sugar, but who are not yet diabetic might also be at risk. A simple blood test named glycated haemoglobin (usually called HbA1c) is used for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and monitoring of diabetes. However, kidney disease and associated complications such as anaemia, can make HbA1c inaccurate. Doctors are advised not to use HbA1c among people with kidney disease for this reason, although exactly how severe kidney disease needs to be before HbA1c is affected is also not known. 
This study will use data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to test how well HbA1c measures blood sugar among people with kidney disease with or without anaemia. We will then test how HbA1c predicts changes in kidney function. This will inform guidelines for setting targets for monitoring and control of blood sugar levels in people with high blood sugar and kidney disease, and ultimately help to prevent the progression of kidney disease.","The primary aim of this study is to understand how glycaemic control, measured by HbA1c predicts trajectories of chronic kidney disease (CKD), among patients with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (HbA1c of 42-47mmol/mol) or with newly diagnosed type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (HbA1c  of 48mmol/mol or greater). Although the relationship between HbA1c and renal outcomes is well described for patients with established T2DM, precise monitoring thresholds or ranges that would indicate lower progression rates of kidney failure is not known. Hence, a retrospective cohort study to assess this issue will be used: patients will enter the study at the first time at which HbA1c is measured at or above 42mmol/mol and will leave upon censoring, or death. A continuous time multi-state model will estimate the transition rate between CKD stages during follow-up, and transition to ""absorbing"" states of mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or other causes from each stage. Estimating the effect of glycaemia on each transition probability is the primary objective.	
The utility of HbA1c for the measurement of glycaemia and diagnosis of DM has been well described. Since the measurement of glycaemic control is known to be affected by CKD and associated complications such as anaemia, we will first test the validity of HbA1c as a measure of glycaemic control at different CKD stages among anaemic and non-anaemic patients. Hence, the validity of HbA1c will be assessed by using all available occasions where HbA1c tests are paired with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG), Full Blood Count (FBC), defined by Haemoglobin (Hb) index, and where CKD stage is known. Using a regression analysis of HbA1c on FPG and CKD we will estimate the effect of CKD stage measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and test the effect of anaemia on the relationship between CKD, glucose and HbA1c.","Primary Outcomes:
The validity of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c ) as a measure of glycaemia in patients with CKD with or without anaemia

Pre-eclampsia is defined as high blood pressure and protein in the urine after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Women with pre-eclampsia appear to have long term health problems and those include high blood pressure and heart attacks later in life. It remains unclear how other blood pressure problems in pregnancy affect long term health. However, we do not know if this increased risk also applies to other cardiovascular (heart) disorders that have become much more frequent in recent years, such as heart failure or atrial fibrillation. In addition, we do not know if some women (according to ethnicity or onset of pre-eclampsia in pregnancy) are at higher risk of having these cardiovascular complications. We want to do a study to answer these important questions. Results from this study will provide accurate important information to help women understand the long term risks that may occur following complicated pregnancy.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in women in the United Kingdom.

When such family history is present, women are referred to a physician specialized in genetic risk in oncology, to have a blood testing to sear for genetic predispositions that increase breast cancer risk. According to the current UK guidelines, having a mastectomy prior any breast cancer occurs can reduce the risk of cancer for these women with specific genetic predispositions. Our research hypothesis is that the number of mastectomy prior any breast cancer within the women population have increased since genetic testing are available (1994), and may also have in the following months after Angelina Jolie's mastectomy announcement in May 2013.

The inflammation is probably due to illness of some sort, but the tests do not identify the exact cause. It may be as simple as a viral infection or as serious as cancer. Sometimes abnormal results sound a false alarm, increasing uncertainty and anxiety for everyone. Sometimes they may help GPs detect illness earlier.  

This research aims to help GPs make better informed decisions when dealing with inflammatory marker test results.

We will study 80,000 people who have had an inflammatory marker blood test in 2014, and 20,000 with no inflammatory markers. We will measure how many of these people have a diagnosis of cancer, infections or autoimmune diseases in the year after testing. We use this to calculate the chance of serious disease in people with normal or raised inflammatory markers. 

We will calculate how this risk of disease varies depending on the 'cut off' or maximum safe level of inflammatory marker test result chosen. This will help doctors dealing with test results to know when to reassure people, and when to do further tests to look for cancer, infection and autoimmune disease.","Millions of inflammatory marker tests (C reactive protein, plasma viscosity and eosinophil sedimentation rate) are performed in the UK annually and testing rates are rising. Most studies of inflammatory markers describe laboratory findings for one single disease, usually in secondary care. The spectrum of diseases seen with abnormal results in primary care is not known, making interpretation of results challenging for GPs. 

This study aims to identify the conditions diagnosed subsequent to an inflammatory marker blood test in primary care. We will study 80,000 patients with inflammatory marker tests in 2014; and 20,000 matched patients with no inflammatory markers. We will measure the subsequent incidence of cancer, infection and autoimmune diseases in the test normal and test positive groups in order to calculate positive and negative predictive values for infections, autoimmune conditions and cancers. We will plot diagnostic accuracy at different levels of raised inflammatory marker using receiver operator curve analysis of sensitivity against 1-specificity, to explore optimum thresholds. We compare incidence of disease in the tested versus untested groups to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of the clinician's decision to request inflammatory markers.

A class of drugs called renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) is used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, and these drugs have been shown to be associated with HPK. Overall, this study will help understand RAASi use in people in England, including patterns of use and frequency of HPK in people who receive RAASi therapy. An important goal of this study is to describe patterns of RAASi use, including how often and why patients change their dose of RAASi treatment or stop taking RAASi treatment. Further, this study will examine consequences of changes to RAASi treament, such as how often poor clinical outcomes occur in patients who change or stop RAASi treatment.","The overall goal of this study is to provide a population-based descriptive analysis of patients receiving RAASi treatment in the UK, with a specific goal of understanding the implications of treatment interruption. RAASi therapy can increase the risk of hyperkalemia, and physicians may decide to reduce the dose or discontinue RAASi therapy following hyperkalemia. The frequency of dose changes and drug discontinuations is not well understood; nor are the subsequent implications in terms of potentially higher event rates. This study will utilize the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database linked to the Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) database. We will also be requesting ONS Mortality linkage to confirm date of death. The cohort to be studied is patients on RAASi therapy, and we will examine treatment patterns, clinical event rates, factors associated with treatment interruptions, and subsequent events following RAASi treatment interruptions. Event rates and 95% CIs for pre-specified outcomes of interest will be reported. RAASi treatment patterns will be examined using proportion of days covered, interruptions, cessations, and dose changes. A Cox proportional hazards model will be used to examine factors associated with interruption/cessation. Cox models will also be used to examine associations between interruptions/cessations and clinical events of interest.",Hyperkalemia; Heart failure hospitalizations; Acute kidney injury; All-cause mortality; Cardiac arrhythmia; Worsening CKD; All-cause hospitalizations; Cardiac arrest; Initiation of dialysis.,"Dr David Gilbertson - Chief Investigator - CDRG

It is performed almost 2 million times a year in England to diagnose early cancer, stop bleeding and treat symptoms. In most patients the procedures are safe, however there are uncommon but important risks following the test. Previous studies have not provided a complete picture of these risks, as they have focussed only on events related to the stomach and bowel, had short follow up times, or not been large enough to capture less common events. The routinely recorded data from primary care and hospitals in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink provides an opportunity to measure these risks in a larger population. In addition, the records provide the background information on patients' pre-existing disease that puts any measured risks in context. The data is fully anonymised so that individual patients cannot be identified, and this allows this study to be conducted on a scale that would not be possible direct patient recruitment.","We will measure excess 30 day absolute risks of emergency hospital admission or death following gastrointestinal endoscopy. These risks will be stratified by type of event, age, sex, socioeconomic status, whether the procedure was planned or an emergency, whether a therapy was performed, and by pre-existing co-morbidity using the Charlson index and bespoke co-morbidity score derived from the CPRD. Events due to diagnoses that might have been related to the indication for the endoscopy will be censored, and will be included in the models as a competing risk using cumulative incidence functions. In addition, further procedures will also be censored. The excess risk associated with each procedure will be calculated by the difference between the risks from the endoscopy cohort with those in an age and sex frequency matched population comparison cohort. We will also perform two secondary analyses to assess the excess risk over an extended 60-days post procedure to identify the time period when any excess risk occurs and whether this returns to the baseline in the comparison cohort by 30 days. Finally, we will assess changes in risks with a test for trend over the calendar years of the study.",Emergency Hospital admission within 30 days;  All-cause mortality within 30 days.,"Dr Colin Crooks - Chief Investigator - University Of Nottingham

HF is a significant burden for both the individual patient and society and new treatment strategies are needed to manage this chronic disease. The gold standard to evaluate therapy is conducting a randomised clinical trial (RCT). RCT's generally have strict in- and exclusion criteria, patients are usually more compliant to treatment due to frequent hospital visits and there is a relatively short follow-up duration. These conditions may not be representative of real world patients using pharmacological treatment for HF. For example, elderly individuals and women are underrepresented in RCTs. With this study we will i) investigate the validity of linked EHR data for HF research by mimicking HF trials and secondly ii) investigate the effectiveness of pharmacological HF treatments in real world patients without these and compare this to the effects observed in typical RCT patients. This study will lead to better insights of the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatment in subgroups of HF patients who are currently underrepresented in RCTs as well as determine the validity of linked EHR sources for HF research.","Objective
a.	The main objectives of this study are to assess validity of linked EHR data for HF research and to determine effectiveness of different types of pharmacological HF treatment in different subgroups of real-world patients. Both objectives will be achieved by replicating RCTs using linked EHR and by subsequently expanding the dataset beyond selective trial populations.

Methods 
We will investigate a longitudinal cohort HF patients between 1st January 1998 and 31st March 2016 for:
b.	Description of use of pharmacological treatment patterns over time 
c.	Comparison of estimates of efficacy from RCTs with treatment of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin-II-receptor blockers or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in real world HF patients.
d.	Study treatment effects in patients beyond those who are typically enrolled in RCTs, and additional research into patient subgroups, leading to estimates of based on comorbidities and risk factors.

Data analysis
Patients will be followed over time to estimate relative risk of mortality and morbidity. We will apply different modern techniques to investigate real world data. First we will replicate intention-to-treat analyses from RCTs, and second we will investigate treatment episodes to replicate an as-treated analysis. We will use inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for confounding.",#NAME?,"Folkert Asselbergs - Chief Investigator - University College London ( UCL )

This damage is often caused by an abnormally high pressure in the eye, which is the only proven treatable predictor of disease for glaucoma. The biological basis of the disease is not yet fully understood, and the factors contributing to its progression are not yet fully characterised. Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness and vision loss, and visual loss due to glaucoma cannot be recovered. To our knowledge there are no publications on the frequency of glaucoma in U.K. and on characteristics of patients developing glaucoma. We therefore aim to quantify in this observational study (i.e., a study with no treatment/intervention) the frequency of new diagnoses of treated glaucoma in the U.K. over time. We will further describe demographics of patients with glaucoma, personal characteristics and life style factors such as obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption, as well as concurrent diseases such as diabetes, dyslipidaemia, dementia, depression, Alzheimer's disease, or multiple sclerosis, and we will compare these characteristics to a sample of glaucoma-free patients in the UK.","Glaucoma is a group of progressive optic neuropathies that have in common a slow progressive neurodegeneration of retinal cells and their axons and a concomitant pattern of visual loss. The biological basis of the disease is not yet fully understood, and the factors contributing to its progression are not yet fully characterised. However, intraocular pressure is the only proven treatable risk factor. Glaucoma is the second most common cause of vision loss worldwide behind cataracts, but, unlike cataracts, the vision loss associated with glaucoma is largely irreversible. Among the major types of glaucoma are open-angle (OAG), angle-closure (ACG), secondary glaucoma, and glaucoma with onset in infancy. In 2010 it was estimated that 60.5 million people suffer with OAG or ACG worldwide. These numbers are expected to reach 79.6 million by 2020, and of these, 74% will have OAG. To our knowledge, incidence rates of glaucoma have not been quantified in the UK. We therefore aim to quantify, through an observational study, the incidence rates of diagnosed and treated glaucoma in the U.K. and compare demographic characteristics, comorbidities (e.g. obesity, diabetes, others), and lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption) between patients with glaucoma and glaucoma-free controls.

This will be done by calculating the time between prescriptions and clinical events associated with a patient requiring specialist review and a record of a referral to a specialist. This information will then be analysed to understand which factors are most important in impacting the waiting time. Asthma management is mostly based on a treatment add-on approach in which higher doses and higher numbers of drugs are prescribed as symptoms continue. Because of this, deciding when an asthma patient needs to be managed by a specialist is more complicated to determine compared to some other diseases. The study to be undertaken could help establish which factors may be barriers to specialist care. This would inform health care organisations as a whole and potentially specialist and general practitioners.","This study is a non-interventional cohort study using existing data provided by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), to gain detailed insights on the waiting time between eligibility and for referral to secondary care for patients treated with additional therapies for asthma.

The main objective of this study is to describe the time to referral and understand the factors associated with length of time waiting for referral to secondary care. Comorbidities and demographic information will be described for the groups of patients initiated on different therapies and survival analysis will be used to estimate the average time to referral and associated risk factors for delay.

It results in an irregular heartbeat and various complaints. The worldwide number of patients with this rhythm disorder is increasing rapidly as the population becomes older and older. The risk of suffering a stroke in people with AF is 5 times higher than in people without AF. Stroke is the blockage of blood flow to portions of the brain, often caused by a blood clot. Patients with AF are often using medicines that help to prevent clots (blood thinners). AF may be associated with trouble with memory and thinking (cognitive impairment or dementia). The possible relationship between stroke, blood thinners, dementia and AF is not well understood. This study will investigate the association between AF and newly diagnosed (new-onset) dementia.","The risk of both dementia and atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age, and several studies have found an increased risk of dementia in AF patients, although findings are inconsistent. Several mechanisms for this association have been proposed, including potential causative factors such as micro emboli, cerebral microbleeds, variable cerebral perfusion and stroke-related dementia. However it is unclear whether this association exists independently or is related to shared vascular risk factors for AF and dementia. Furthermore, the potential modifying role of anticoagulation in AF - which reduces the risk of stroke by two-thirds - in its relationship with dementia is also unknown. This study will investigate the association between incident non-valvular AF and new-onset dementia in a cohort with incident non-valvular AF and a matched cohort without AF.

This limitation of using the data is often acknowledged in studies with a single sentence, but not considered further. We think this is one of the causes for the many conflicting study results in the field, and propose to measure how accurate studies are. For this we use controls, which are questions where we know the answer, and see whether the study setup produces the correct answer. We want to go even further and calibrate the result of the study to take into account the deviation that we observe for the controls. 
To demonstrate this approach we want to reproduce two previous studies that found conflicting results, and use controls to evaluate and calibrate these studies. We first want to show that our calibration procedure corrects the results for our controls. Next, we would like to show that the calibration makes the two studies more in agreement.","This study will include two analyses investigating the risk of upper Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding during exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), intended to replicate the analyses performed by Tata et al.1 as closely as possible. The first analysis is a matched case-control study; the second analysis is a self-controlled case series (SCCS). The same analyses used to create estimates for upper GI bleeding will also be used to produce estimates for a set of 50 negative control outcomes which are not believed to be caused by SSRIs and where the true relative risk is therefore believed to be one. Additional estimates will be generated for 3x50 synthetic positive controls derived from the negative controls. Positive controls will be generated by fitting outcome models for each negative control, and inserting additional outcomes based on the predicted probabilites of patients for the outcomes, thus preserving any observed confounding stucture while increasing the true relative risk to three predefined levels: 1.5, 2, and 4.

Whilst some of these admissions are necessary and appropriate, many are for conditions that may be treated effectively in the community, e.g. minor infectious illnesses. Babies who were born too early (preterm) are admitted to hospital more frequently than children who were not born early, due to both minor disorders and long-term health conditions that persist through later life (e.g. asthma, cerebral palsy or epilepsy). It is therefore particularly important that health services can properly care for the needs of this vulnerable group of children. 

To avoid unnecessary emergency hospital admissions, we need to know how and when children born preterm have contact with health services. Linked anonymised hospital and GP data provides the opportunity to find out how health services could better care for children born preterm, outside of hospital settings. This study will firstly describe how preterm babies with different health conditions use primary care services. We will then explore the types of children who are more likely to be admitted to hospital in an emergency, to characterise families who could benefit from increased support outside of hospital.","We aim to describe the interaction between primary and secondary healthcare service use in children aged 1-10 years who were born preterm (<37 weeks gestation), and to explore individual and household determinants of emergency hospital use, by using 1) linkage with HES inpatient and A&E data; 2) the pregnancy register; and 3) the household indicator.

Secondly, we will use the CPRD household indicator to define household characteristics, e.g. number of siblings, number of adults, and health burden (total healthcare contacts per person-year). To identify determinants of variation in emergency healthcare use, we will model the number of emergency hospital admissions per child-year, evaluating the effects of primary care contacts, individual risk-factors, and household characteristics. 

This study will help identify vulnerable households who may be at risk of unnecessary hospital contacts and who would most benefit from increased support in the community. This evidence will help policy makers and commissioners make informed decisions about the best ways to meet the needs of these families through maternity and paediatric services.","-	Primary care consultations

UK guidelines currently recommend that patients are offered a statin if: (i) their estimated risk of having a cardiovascular disease event like a heart attack over the next 10 years is 10% or more (before 2014 this threshold was 20%); or (ii) if they have previously had a heart or circulatory disease diagnosis. Using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database, which collects information from participating general practices in England and Wales, this study aims to describe trends in the recording of estimated cardiovascular risk, and in the prescription of statins to these two groups of eligible patients over time, including changes in trends by age group, sex and socioeconomic status. Among patients starting a statin, we will also examine whether people appear to consistently take the pills as prescribed, how often people report muscle symptoms, and how long people stay on the therapy. These analyses will provide an insight into whether clinical guidelines are routinely followed, whether all groups of patients are being monitored and offered statin treatment equally, and the extent to which people who start a statin remain on their drug as intended.","There has recently been much interest in the practice of prescribing statins to prevent cardiovascular disease. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence currently recommends the prescription of stations for: (i) primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, following a ten year cardiovascular risk score of 10% (prior to 2014 this threshold was 20%); and (ii) secondary prevention following a cardiovascular event. Using primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we will first describe trends in cardiovascular risk monitoring among people with no prior cardiovascular disease. Among people eligible to start a statin, logistic regression will be used to look at calendar time changes in, and other factors associated with, initiating a statin. Patterns of statin adherence will be described, and discontinuation will also be examined using time-to-event methods.

Medications prescribed by doctors are often tailored to individual patient needs, in order to balance how well a specific drug works against the risk of side effects, including weight gain and low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia).1 However, the precise relationships that exist between treatment choice, achieving normal blood sugar levels (glycaemic control), treatment-related side effects and how well patients comply with their prescriptions (medication adherence) are unclear.

Recent studies have investigated links between medication adherence and glycaemic control2; and links between hypoglycaemia and the risks of heart disease and death.3 However, these studies do not assess all possible relationships between treatment choice, medication adherence, and treatment side effects. Furthermore, these studies do not investigate the treatments that are frequently prescribed by doctors, such as combinations of different blood sugar-lowering drugs. 

By analysing clinical data that is routinely collected in the UK, this study aims to relate changes in blood sugar levels, weight and incidence of hypoglycaemia, to treatment choice and medication adherence in type 2 diabetes patients.","The objectives of this retrospective cohort study are to characterise associations between HbA1c, weight and hypoglycemia to treatment choice and medication adherence in T2DM. Patient-level data will be extracted from the CPRD, to retrospectively analyse a cohort of T2DM patients (>18 years of age) who were prescribed one of five treatment regimens between 2008 and 2016: OHA monotherapy; OHA dual therapy; OHA triple therapy; GLP-1-based therapy; insulin-based therapy. Outcomes of interest in this study are: 1-year change in HbA1c from baseline; 1-year change in weight from baseline; hypoglycemia incidence (1-year total events and rate); medication adherence, including medication compliance (defined by patients' calculated medication possession ratio, MPR) and medication persistence (defined by patients' proportion of days covered, PDC; and time to treatment intensification).

Univariate and multivariate methods of statistical analysis will characterise the associations between HbA1c, weight and hypoglycemia to treatment choice and medication adherence. Summary descriptive statistics will be generated, characterising patient demographics, clinical and treatment characteristics, and medication use. Stratified descriptive statistics and regression models for medication adherence and HbA1c will be fitted to the data adjusting for the influence of observed covariates (potential confounders) including demographic, clinical and socioeconomic factors, other prescriptions, comorbidities and centre effects.","Health outcomes: The following outcomes will be derived and analysed:

These values -- prevalence (how much disease exists in a population at a time) and incidence (how much new disease occurs in a population) -- are the bedrock of public health and policy. While databases such as CPRD offer a widely available and cost-effective way to make these measurements, there is not yet a universally-accepted approach to doing so. For instance, varying how long to look backwards in time in the data to determine how prevalent disease is, being more specific about what times patients are observable (and thus would have recorded disease), or changing the required amount of observable time to be eligible for study, may yield meaningfully different results. We will investigate whether these decisions and several others meaningfully affect what we would report as prevalence and incidence. In all cases, we will use publicly-available measurements done with more traditional techniques as a reference point to determine when a correct measurement has been made.","This study will investigate how different methodological assumptions of measuring prevalence and incidence may affect the observed prevalence and incidence of chronic disease in the CPRD database. Assumptions include how much time to look back to identify prevalent disease, different ways of calculating a denominator, and different ways of identifying incident cases. The prevalence and incidence observed under each set of assumptions will be compared with other measures of prevalence/incidence for the disease of interest in the UK, in order to determine a reasonable set of assumptions to apply in making these measurements in data such as CPRD. This will be performed for five different diseases, including cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, schizophrenia, psoriasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These diseases were selected as they have a range of different expected prevalences and incidences in the population, which will enable investigation into how the effects the methodological assumptions depend on the underlying prevalence/incidence.

Ondansetron is a drug used to treat nausea resulting from chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Despite warnings against its use during pregnancy, it is still being prescribed to treat nausea and vomiting among pregnant women. No studies thus far have been of sufficient size to properly consider rarer pregnancy outcomes such as stillbirth and major birth defects. Fluconazole is used to treat fungal infections including candidiasis. While low doses have not been reported to increase congenital abnormalities, high doses have been associated with abnormalities and questions remain regarding its safety during pregnancy.

This study will examine a) the utilisation of ondansetron and fluconazole among pregnant women compared to other anti-nausea drugs and other drugs used to treat fungus infections, respectively; and b) the association between the usage of these two drugs and increased risks of foetal abnormalities. This study will involve data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and administrative data from 5 Canadian provinces. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of an adverse pregnancy outcome, defined as at least one of the following events: stillbirth, induced abortion, congenital malformation, and spontaneous abortion.","Ondansetron is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT3, having antiemetic properties to treat nausea. Though it is not indicated for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, it is often prescribed to pregnant women.  However, there are potentially severe effects on the foetus. Fluconazole is a highly selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P-450 sterol C-14 alpha-demethylation used to treat candidiasis. High doses of fluconazole (400 - 800 mg/day) have been associated with increased risk for congenital malformations. However, questions remain regarding its safety in relation to exposure and dose. To further examine the effect of these two drugs on pregnant women and foetuses, we will conduct a retrospective, population-based cohort study. Pregnancies will be divided into several cohorts (live births, stillbirths, induced abortions, and spontaneous abortions) and use of ondansetron and fluconazole in each group will be assessed. The congenital abnormalities of ondansetron will be compared to diclectin, dimenhydrinate, chlorpromazine, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, or promethazine. The effects of fluconazole will be compared to polyene antifungals, imidazoles, or triazoles.

COPD is characterised by symptoms of breathlessness, cough, and production of sputum.

People with COPD often have worsening of their symptoms, and this is often triggered by an infection. These worsenings are termed exacerbations. They may be treated by the patient's GP with antibiotics and steroids, however more serious events may require admission to hospital. Many COPD patients have one or two exacerbations per year, however some have many more exacerbations while others do not seem to have any at all. 

This study will use primary care data linked with hospital data to investigate how the frequency and severity of exacerbations relate to risk of future exacerbations and risk of death. This work will help doctors understand which of their patients may be at higher risk of hospital admission or death.","People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often have acute worsening of their symptoms, termed acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). These may be treated in primary care or may require hospitalisation. 

Frequency of AECOPD is thought to be a stable trait over time, however this has not been investigated in a primary care cohort. Although others have studied the relationship between severe AECOPD (hospitalised) and risk of death in those with COPD, this relationship is not clear for moderate AECOPD (treated by GP). 

We hypothesise that there are a large portion of COPD patients who never exacerbate, and that long term risk of death increases with increasing number of baseline AECOPD and with AECOPD severity.

Using linked CPRD-HES-ONS data, we will perform a cohort study to investigate the rates of AECOPD (moderate and severe) and death during follow-up by baseline AECOPD frequency (defined as first 12 months after observation start). In particular we will characterise the rate of AECOPD and death in COPD patients who do not seem to exacerbate during baseline period. We will also conduct three nested case-control analyses to investigate the impact of frequency and severity of AECOPD in the previous three years on risk of: 1) moderate AECOPD; 2) severe AECOPD; and 3) death.",#NAME?,"Professor Jennifer Quint - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

Hip replacement, for example, brings pain relief and improved function to 70000 UK patients with hip arthritis each year.
No surgery is without risk and the risks during and after surgery are increased in elderly patients and those with other health conditions. Weighing up risks and benefits, and making the decision whether or not to have an operation is more difficult when there are other health problems. There is, however, no strong evidence to best advise patients. As a consequence we don't know if the 'right' decision is made. 
The proposed research will use a large general practice database of patients identified as having arthritis, including both 'wear-and-tear' arthritis and autoimmune arthritis. Using the database the researchers will investigate levels of other existing health problems in the patients and analyse how they informed the decision for any subsequent joint surgery. Those who received surgery will be followed up using both general practice and hospital data sources to determine if their pre-existing other health conditions actually did affect outcomes from surgery.
The goal of the research is to provide information to better support decision making for patients and those who advise them.","Changes to the UK population demographic have led to a rise in the number of total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) procedures performed on elderly patients. These patients have an increasing level of comorbidity, which can constrain the benefits of surgery and increase intra-operative and post-operative risks. At present there is limited evidence on the effect of pre-existing comorbidites on benefits and risks from THR and TKR surgery, making decision-making on whether to proceed with surgery difficult. This project aims to investigate the relationship between comorbidity and the likelihood of a patient with arthritis being referred for arthroplasty, and, if surgery is undertaken, the short and medium term outcomes.
Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics databases, we will interrogate the records of over 100,000 patients aged >65 with a coded GP diagnosis of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis to assess their baseline levels of comorbidity using a range of metrics, the time taken between diagnosis and surgery, and key outcomes of surgery. Statistical techniques, including survival modelling and multiple regressions, will be used to describe the associations between the outcomes. We hope our results will prove useful to patients and clinicians.","First objective:
The primary outcome is validity of the CPRD electronic diagnostic code for hip osteoarthritis. 
- To determine whether the diagnostic code is valid, we will seek further information from a sub-group of 100 patients, who will be randomly selected by CPRD from the larger cohort. A questionnaire has been designed, which will be sent to the GPs of the 100 selected patients. The GPs will be requested to complete the questions based on information available in each patient's electronic primary care notes. The questions will relate to the NICE diagnostic criteria for hip osteoarthritis, with questions focusing on symptoms of pain, results of X-rays and referral to secondary care. Depending on the information gained from the questionnaire, each patient's diagnosis will be deemed valid or invalid. If the positive predictive value of the diagnostic codes is >75% (i.e. over 75% of patients have an accurate diagnosis), then we will conclude the diagnostic code is valid and continue with objectives two and three.

Second objective:
The primary outcomes are 
(i)	Dichotomous outcome of referred or not referred to secondary care (to secondary care for orthopaedic opinion of their diseased joint) 
(ii)	Time from GP diagnosis of osteoarthritis to referral to secondary care for orthopaedic opinion
(iii)	Time from referral to secondary care to receipt of surgery (THR/TKR)
(iv)	Time from GP diagnosis of osteoarthritis to receipt of surgery (THR/TKR)
Data on these outcomes will be extracted from CPRD 

Third objective: 
The primary outcome is complication rate in the 90 days following THR or TKR surgery. Included complications are:
- Death
- Venous thromboembolism
- Myocardial infarction
- Stroke
- Anaemia
- Respiratory, urinary tract and wound infections

The secondary outcomes are:
- PROMs (Oxford hip score, Oxford knee score, EQ-5D Index and EQ-VAS) (raw score and improvement from pre-op score at 24 months post-operatively)
- Length of hospital stay (for admission for THR/TKR)
- Early (90-day) re-admission rate

With these advances comes the problem of known and unknown side effects of the drugs used in treatment. The drug tamoxifen has long been used to help stop some types of breast cancer coming back after surgery. However, more recently, a different type of drug known as aromatase inhibitors (AI) have been shown to further reduce the risk of breast cancer returning in women who are past menopause. Relatively little is known in regards to the side effects of aromatase inhibitors, especially the effects they have on the heart. We will therefore attempt to use UK primary healthcare records to compare the risk of a range of cardiovascular diseases, like heart attacks, strokes and others, between breast cancer survivors treated with tamoxifen, and those treated with aromatase inhibitors.","The main objective of this study is to investigate whether CVD risks among post-menopausal breast cancer survivors exposed to AIs are different to those patients treated with tamoxifen. We will achieve this by following a cohort of post-menopausal breast cancer survivors in the CPRD prescribed both AIs and tamoxifen, assessing a range CVD outcomes. We will use unadjusted and fully adjusted Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), comparing the rate of a range of CVD outcomes between patients prescribed AI therapy only, tamoxifen therapy only, or both drug classes.

It is well known that diabetes increases the chances of getting some infections and a recent analysis of data collected by GPs in the UK found that the number of infections among older people with diabetes was rising (by 30% between 1997-2010), because diabetes is becoming more common and people in the UK are getting older. Some studies have found that lowering blood sugar levels (through exercise, diet or medication) might prevent some infections or reduce their severity. This is potentially very important in guiding NHS targets for blood sugar levels in people with diabetes, particularly among older people for whom infections may be frequent and potentially serious, and have a large impact of their quality of life. However, lowering blood sugar in older people with diabetes may increase the risk of falls so the ideal blood sugar levels for older people with diabetes are not clear. This project will provide robust estimates of:	
1)	 the risk of a comprehensive range of infections among people with diabetes, compared to those without diabetes, including both older and younger people with diabetes
2)	 the links between blood sugar control and risks of infection","Diabetes has been linked with increased risk of many infections, but studies have mostly been in small or selected populations, sometimes without gold standard definitions of diabetes, or adequate control for confounding. Most have only considered a small number of infections. There is evidence from population based studies that improved glycaemic control is associated with a significantly lower risk or severity of some infections. This is potentially important in guiding targets for diabetes control, particularly among older people with diabetes for whom infections may be frequent and potentially serious, and for whom there is uncertainty regarding the risk to benefit ratio of improved glycaemic control. We plan to obtain data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2008-2015); approximately 85,000 prevalent DM patients aged 40 and over annually. We will link to Hospital Episode Statistics to independently identify serious infections requiring hospitalisation. Infections will be identified by Read codes with simultaneous prescribing of an antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral treatment. In a cohort study design, we will use poisson regression to estimate the rate of specific infections among people with diabetes, compared to those without diabetes, and to relate HbA1c levels from 2008-2010 to future infections (2011-2015).

This can put them at greater risk of developing a substance abuse disorder, self-harm and future psychiatric issues as well as impact on their social development, academic careers and earning prospects. A recent Department of Heath report entitled 'Future in mind' highlighted the importance of providing early and effective treatments for these children and young people, as well as identifying current shortfalls in service provision, including lack of treatment continuity through adolescence and into early adulthood. Currently adolescents mostly transition to adult services between the ages of 16 and 17. This is a key period of heightened risk for depression and a time at which adolescents are already experiencing a number of other important transitions as they step towards adulthood. This study will investigate how age at time of first-ever depression diagnosis affects the clinical management of 12-24 year olds diagnosed between 2012 and 2014. It will examine the type of mental health services they are referred to, their level of contact with primary care and hospital based services and the treatments they are prescribed.

Hip dysplasia is the single largest cause of total hip replacement in young adults. Early diagnosis of DDH is crucial as a simple treatment (harnesses), has greater than 90% success rates when started within the first few months of life. The success rate of simple treatment falls significantly with increasing age, necessitating surgery. A screening programme for DDH exists in the UK whereby every newborn child has a routine examination of the hips after birth. An abnormal hip exam, or the presence of major risk factors requires a hip ultrasound scan (USS) at 6 weeks of age. Despite this screening programme cases are missed by screening, and diagnoses after six months of age are frequent. In Austria uniform USS screening is performed and there are negligible cases of missed/late presenting DDH. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink provides a unique opportunity to investigate the incidence of DDH in the UK, and in particular those diagnosed after the screening period. This data may inform the debate on hip screening in the UK.","The main objective of this study is to assess the incidence of DDH requiring intervention, as well as in those diagnosed outside of the timescale of the infant screening programme (>6 months gestation). Within CPRD GOLD, patients aged <8years old on the date of entry of a diagnostic code indicative for DDH, will be searched for, after 1st January 1990 and before 1st November 2015. HES will be used to validate this cohort, with the study population restricted to children who are eligible for linkage between CPRD GOLD and HES. Cases with diagnostic codes for neuromuscular disease will be excluded. Cases will also be internally validated. Descriptive analysis will be performed on data in 3 and 6 month bands. Poisson confidence intervals will be calculated and Poisson regression performed to examine trends using Stata 14.0.","Cases will be defined by an entry of a diagnostic code representing 'developmental dysplasia of the hip' within the individual's electronic patient record. The keywords searched were 'hip', 'dysplasia', 'dysplastic', 'dislocated' and 'DDH', 'CDH', 'Pavlik', 'open reduction' and 'closed reduction'. Risk factors (e.g. breech presentation and family history) are known to possibly predict a diagnosis of DDH. However, these patients are all seen in selected screening programmes. Therefore, late presenting cases are more likely to not have these risk factors. Late diagnosed DDH (>6 months) is much more difficult to treat, with higher rates of complications. As a result, it has an increased use of health resources.","Professor Nicholas Clarke - Chief Investigator - University Of Southampton

Nevertheless, patients included in the study had to meet specific criteria which suggests, that study participants might differ from the general patient population with Type 2 Diabetes in the community. The purpose of this study is to assess the eligibility of Type 2 Diabetes patients treated in community to the aforementioned study and examine their characteristics. As a result, this study can contribute in raising awareness about the actual patient population that is more likely to benefit from treatment with empagliflozin. This is a descriptive study using CPRD data.","The intention of the study is to determine how representative the participants of EMPAREG-OUTCOME RCT are to T2DM patients identified from primary care records. A T2DM patient cohort will be defined in CPRD on which the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME RCT will be operationalised to define a patient cohort that would be eligible for inclusion in the RCT. This patient subpopulation will be further characterised in terms of clinical and demographic parameters to understand how 'real world' patients matching RCT's eligibility criteria, compare to patients that actually took part in the RCT. As a result, this study can contribute in raising awareness about the generalizability of RCT results and the representativeness of RCT patients. The treatment history of patients who participated in the EMPAREG-OUTCOME RCT has been reported in detail in the supplementary material section of the study report, including history of glucose lowering therapy, anti-hypertensive therapies, lipid lowering therapies and anticoagulants. The proposed study therefore will also describe the treatment history of patients treated in routine clinical practice who meet the main eligibility criteria of the clinical trial.",The main outcome of the study is the percentage of patients who meet EMPA-REG OUTCOME clinical trial eligibility criteria from the initial T2DM patient cohort.,"Professor Kamlesh Khunti - Chief Investigator - University of Leicester

We propose to investigate general practice patient records for women aged 30-60 years old from 2004 to 2016. We will calculate the annual proportion of women who have at least one or more suitable appointments, taking into account women's age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

The majority of men with prostate cancer will have a slow growing form of the cancer and survive for years after diagnosis. Researchers have shown that there are certain factors that are related to whether a man will die from prostate cancer, including body mass index (BMI), ethnic background and family history of prostate cancer. There are other factors that researchers think might also be related. These include lifestyle factors (e.g. high fat diet), medications (e.g. statins), and other medical problems (e.g. diabetes). Our study will use a database of anonymised GP records and information from the national prostate cancer register. We will examine the records of men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and assess what routinely recorded factors are related to whether or not a man is at greater risk of dying from his prostate cancer or further spread of the disease after being diagnosed. This study could be the first step in developing a new way to predict which men with prostate cancer will have more aggressive, potentially fatal disease, so they and their clinicians are better informed when making decisions about treatments.","The objective of this study is to establish which risk factors are associated with prostate cancer progression using primary care medical records data. Prostate cancer progression can be defined as the occurrence of one of the following after diagnosis of localised disease; development of metastases, change in treatment, or death. Our retrospective cohort study will include 57,318 men with prostate cancer diagnosed in between 1st January 1987 and 31st July 2016; 22,080 of whom died during the study period. We will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to gather information on demographics and risk factors identified a priori, and linked data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) on cancer stage/grade and mortality. Cox proportion hazard regression and survival analysis using flexible parametric models will be utilised to determine factors associated with mortality in men with prostate cancer accounting for competing risks of other causes of death. This study could be the first step in developing a way to predict which men with prostate cancer will have more aggressive disease.

Resistant hypertension is high blood pressure that does not respond to treatment with at least three blood-pressure lowering drugs. Our results will provide up to date information on the changing burden of this important risk factor for heart disease. This is especially valuable in light of an ageing and ever obese population, both of which increase the risk of high blood pressure. Furthermore, we will assess the prognosis of adults with resistant hypertension in comparison to adults without resistant hypertension. We will assess whether people with resistant hypertension have more bad outcomes such as such heart attacks, strokes, deaths, heart failure and kidney disease than people without resistant hypertension. Our results will also be helpful in that they will provide information on how different types of patient characteristics predict having an outcome like a heart attack or stroke, and this information can then be used in identifying people who are high priority for improving blood pressure management.","Using the CPRD-GOLD database, we will identify all the prevalence and incidence of resistant hypertension between 1995 and 2015. We will measure trends for prevalence and incidence, adjusted for age and gender using poisson regression. In addition, we will conduct a prognosis study, comparing the rate of myocardial infarction, stroke, all cause death, heart failure and renal failure in those with resistant hypertension and those without.

CHD and stroke are caused by hardening of the arteries, with persistent inflammation being a major risk factor for the latter. Our research using electronic health records has found that people diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and lupus are more likely to develop CHD and stroke, leading to poorer quality of life and reduced expectancy of life. Few patients with inflammatory disorders have their CHD or stroke risk assessed. Inflammatory disorders are also associated with uncontrolled inflammation and risk factors for CHD and stroke, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. This research proposes that patients with inflammatory disorders will benefit from improved prevention and management of CHD and stroke risk. The research will analyse primary care electronic health records to establish the most effective approach to identify patients at risk of CHD or stroke events, and to evaluate the safest strategy to reduce the risk of CHD or stroke events in patients diagnosed with specific inflammatory disorders.","The exact contributions of vascular risk factors and inflammation to the increased cardiovascular risk across diverse inflammatory disorders is unclear. Also, current CVD risk score calculators underestimate CVD risk in inflammatory disorders, and limited empirical evidence is available on how best to manage CVD risk across diverse inflammatory disorders and population subgroups. The proposed study aims to address these gaps using primary care electronic health records linked with hospital records. The study will implement time to event analyses to evaluate the independent and combined influence of hypertension and total cholesterol, as well as inflammation on the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease. The study will also evaluate the prognostic value of adding arterial stiffness data to the QRISK2 risk score to predict future CVD risk. Further, the study will investigate the long-term safety of setting more stringent blood pressure and total cholesterol targets within specific chronic inflammatory disorders. The potential for these associations to vary by populations subgroups defined by gender, ethnicity, and deprivation will be explored. The inflammatory disorders considered are those known to confer increased risk of CVD events, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, inflammatory bowel diseases, ankylosing spondylitis, and vasculitis.","- Stroke

However, individuals with certain social characteristics (for example, those living in more deprived areas) may be less likely to receive vaccination. At present, information about social factors that affect whether individuals in England receive vaccination is lacking. This makes it difficult to plan interventions to address these disadvantages. This study will examine the social factors that may be associated with lower uptake of flu vaccine and whooping cough vaccine by pregnant women. These factors will include the pregnant woman's age, her marital status, her ethnicity, whether she was born outside the UK, how many pregnancies she has had previously and how many children she has. Identifying social factors that are associated with lower vaccination rates will help to design programmes to improve vaccine uptake for specific groups of individuals. We will also describe the proportion of pregnant women who receive each of these vaccines, over time and by stage (each three months) of pregnancy.","Addressing inequalities in vaccine uptake to prevent infections is a key priority for public health. In England, current surveillance methods provide little information about social factors associated with vaccine uptake. This project will use linked electronic health records and a cohort study design to investigate the association between social factors and uptake of both flu and pertussis vaccine in pregnancy. Inactivated influenza vaccine was introduced for pregnant women in England in 2010, and maternal pertussis vaccination was introduced in October 2012. Using a cohort study design and multivariable Poisson regression, we will identify the social determinants of uptake of each vaccine.

Some of the patients at highest risk of developing hyperkalemia are those taking medications that raise their potassium levels as a side effect. These medications are used to treat high blood pressure, a common condition found alongside chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF). When the hormone system that controls blood pressure is abnormally active, blood pressure rises. Inhibitors of this system, medications called renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), work to interrupt this system, thereby reducing blood pressure. However, RAASi therapies can also increase blood potassium levels by causing the retention of potassium in the blood, leading to serious incidents involving the heart. Over the long term, patients with CKD and HF are at high risk for hyperkalemia if they continue taking RAASi therapy. Understanding how many people who have had CKD and/or HF and have also had hyperkalemia, and the treatment implications following a hyperkalemic event are necessary to demonstrate the considerable unmet need for a treatment that is able to control hyperkalemia over the long term in this patient group.","Hyperkalemia is medically defined as a blood serum potassium level of > 5.5mmol/L, which can arise from ineffective elimination of potassium from the blood. Hyperkalemia is common in patients with CKD and HF as the kidneys are unable to sufficiently remove excess potassium from the blood. RAAS inhibitors are indicated for the treatment of CKD and HF as they lower resistance in the blood vessels of the kidneys through inhibition of key enzymes controlling the RAAS system. A side effect of this inhibition is the retention of potassium, which may lead to hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, meaning that patients on RAASis may be undertreated. The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of the prevalence of hyperkalemia among patients with CKD, HF, or both CKD and HF, and to determine clinical decisions after a hyperkalemia event in these groups specifically in relation to treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) therapy. This research will be important in understanding the unmet need in this patient group for a hyperkalemia treatment which safely controls the condition over the long term.

As these regimens become increasingly common their public health impact should be assessed, especially in regards to their potential association with breast cancer. These treatments may affect breast cancer risk through their actions on reproductive hormone levels in treated women. In past decades, estrogen and progesterone have been shown to play an important role in the development of many breast cancers. 1. We propose to examine the association between three different fertility treatments, clomiphene, letrozole and in-vitro fertilization, and breast cancer. Common to these treatments is their effect on the ovulatory cycle as they stimulate the ovulation of oocytes, (cells in ovaries which may undergo division to form an ovum), yet cause the levels of circulating reproductive hormones to become higher than normal for brief but not-insignificant periods of time. While there have been prior studies examining this association, the results are so far contradictory and seemingly inconclusive. Results from our study will be important for both influencing current fertility treatment protocols as well as screening protocols for women who have undergone such treatments in the past.","Background: Fertility treatments whose mechanisms of action involve the induction of ovulation cause circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone to increase to supraphysiologic levels which may contribute to long-term risk of breast cancer due to the cancer's strong interplay with a woman's hormonal profile. Objectives: To examine the association between three different fertility treatments which aid in inducing ovulation and breast cancer risk. Methods: A population-based matched case control study using the CPRD will be performed to calculate odds ratios for the treatments of interest: clomiphene, letrozole and in-vitro fertilization. Incident cases of breast cancer will be ascertained through a validated algorithm used in prior breast cancer studies by our group using the same database. Controls will be population-based. Exposure will be assessed through the patient's medical history for evidence of being prescribed/having undergone one of the three aforementioned fertility treatments. Data Analysis: Conditional logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios and 95% CIs comparing the exposure of these three fertility treatments in breast cancer cases compared to the exposure levels in controls. Some confounding factors, notably age, calendar time of follow-up and socioeconomic status will be adjusted for through matching, while the remaining factors will be adjusted for through the logistic regression.",Breast cancer.,"Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

An exploratory study investigating temporal patterns in morbidity before death using primary care data,"While life expectancy in the UK has continued to increase, it is unclear whether these additional years are being lived in good or poor health. If the increase is mainly attributable to elderly people surviving longer with longstanding disease, this would imply that additional years of life gained are primarily being lived in poor health. However, if people are developing diseases later, then the amount of time spent in ill health during one's life may be falling. This is known as a compression of morbidity. These scenarios present different healthcare implications for the NHS; it is therefore important to understand how these trends are developing.

Our study will investigate patterns of illness before death for patients who died during 2000-2015. Using information recorded on their patient electronic record, linked to other key health data, we will summarise their disease levels and wellbeing during their last 5 years of life. We will compare disease levels and wellbeing between patients who have died across different periods in the study. This will allow us to see if people dying recently are spending more or less of their final years in good health compared to patients who died at the beginning of the study.","It is unclear whether continued increases in life expectancy in the UK have been accompanied by an expansion or contraction of morbidity in later life. To investigate this further, we will use linked ONS mortality data to identify date of death for approximately 200,000 patients from 150 CPRD practices recording up-to-standard data between 2000 and 2015. Additionally, we will identify a comparison group of age-sex matched patients (2 per death, 1 matched on practice) alive at the time of the case death.

We will focus on the last 5 years of life and estimate morbidity in patients, primarily using a broad range of chronic conditions, but additionally using frailty measures. We will compare morbidity between periods to see whether patients who died recently have more morbidity before death than those dying 10-15 years previously. Analyses will control for age at death, which will have increased by approximately 2 years from 2000 to 2015.

There are rising concerns of combining new (those who have never used the older and newer therapies) and prior treatment users (those with a prior history of using older and newer therapies) in comparative effectiveness studies. Existing methods propose to only include new treatment users but this would exclude a large patient population in the real world. A more inclusive method is to match patients of newer to older therapies on prior history of treatment but this method is infeasible when there is increasing trend of using the newer compared with older treatment. Therefore, the objective of the study is to explore two alternative methods to include all patients in the real world. Specifically, in the first approach we will randomly select a patient group to make the older treatment group more comparable to the newer treatment group and in the second approach we will consider a scenario where patients change their treatment over time.

This can lead to further complications and hospitalisation, which is difficult both emotionally and economically for the family and friends of these patients and stretches the limited National Health Service and local council resources. This research will help to understand which patients with dementia  are most at risk of pneumonia by exploring how different formulations and swallowing problems (dysphagia) affect the chances of contracting pneumonia alongside other various risk factors and confounders. This research is an important step to improving the lives of dementia patients and towards meeting the objectives in the National Dementia Strategy.","We will conduct a case-control study nested within a cohort of dementia patients to determine whether there are associations between dysphagia and pneumonia and medicine formulations and pneumonia. Secondary objectives are to determine whether the presence of other hypothesised risk factors increase the odds of being diagnosed with pneumonia. All patients will have a diagnosis of dementia between 1987 and the practices last collection date. Cases will have a record of pneumonia (date of first pneumonia since dementia diagnosis is the index date). Controls will be matched by date of dementia diagnosis, age, region and index date in a ratio of 4:1 with no diagnosis of pneumonia up to the index date. The proportion and distribution of each exposure and covariate will be described for cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression models will be used to estimate (i) the effect of dysphagia and (ii) the moderating effect of medication formulation on any association between dysphagia and pneumonia incidence while controlling for other factors hypothesised to be linked to pneumonia. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be reported; p-values <0.01 shall be considered statistically significant. A sensitivity analysis will include only those with dysphagia to confirm previous methods and results.","Pneumonia: After a washout period of 3 months since dementia diagnosis, the first incidence of pneumonia shall be recorded by the presence of any READ codes.","Dr George Savva - Chief Investigator - University of East Anglia

A rare subtype of PC is called familial chylomicronaemia syndrome (FCS) and presents with severe complications early in life.  Until now treatment options have been limited for individuals with PC, but recent breakthroughs mean new therapies are in development and may soon be available.

Using routinely collected electronic health data from general practices, hospital admissions and death registry sources we aim to estimate the potential number of people in the United Kingdom with PC and its rarer subtype FCS, their rates of death compared with the general population and their usage of healthcare services. We also propose to estimate the risk of acute pancreatitis and abdominal pain in these patients compared to similar patients without the disease. We will also explore the risks of PC patients developing diabetes and heart diseases long term.  

With the findings of this study we aim to create an overall picture of the impact PC has on patients and healthcare services in the United Kingdom. This information will support the development and cost effectiveness analyses of new treatments for PC.","Using linked electronic health records comprising of CPRD, hospital episode statistics (HES), and national mortality registry (ONS) data sources, the objectives of the study are to (1) identify preliminary estimates of cases with Primary chylomicronaemia (PC) through a set of descriptive analyses of patients in with elevated triglyceride levels (e.g. >8.4mmol/L) and the presence/absence of related conditions (acute pancreatitis and obesity), (2) develop a phenotype algorithm for identifying cases with PC and sub-phenotypes of differing specificity for PC by varying the threshold of triglyceride levels as well as age cut points and disease definitions. (3) evaluate the burden of PC in the UK through calculating prevalence, standard mortality ratios, and rates of primary and secondary healthcare usage, (4) estimate the risks of acute pancreatitis and abdominal pain in PC patients compared with age and gender matched controls without PC and (5) estimate the risks of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and 12 different cardiovascular endpoints in PC patients. 

For objectives (4) & (5) we will use Kaplan Meier plots to estimate cumulative incidence and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for confounders, to estimate hazard ratios of the endpoints.","- Primary chylomicronaemia

Complications of diverticular disease include the formation of abscesses and holes in the bowel called perforation. These complications often require surgery to treat them which is associated with a high risk of death and complications. There has therefore been interest in using less invasive methods such as key-hole surgery to reduce the risk of complications. Currently there are no studies that report on the short and long term results of these techniques. Using large databases of electronic health records, we intend to study patients with these complications of diverticular disease and report how frequently they occur, how often people die following them and from what causes. We will also report what the outcomes from these minimally invasive techniques are in terms of the need for further surgical intervention, stoma formation and re-admission to hospital. The potential benefit of this research is that it will enable practitioners to inform patients of the outcomes of these procedures which will aid in their decision making when being offered these treatments.","Diverticular disease is one of the most common problems encountered by general surgeons and gastroenterologists. Complications of diverticular disease such as perforation and abscess account for the majority of the morbidity and mortality associated with diverticular disease. Given the age and comorbidity of these patients and the high risks of stoma formation and death following surgery there has been interest in pursuing less invasive methods of treatment for these complications. The Association of Coloproctologists of Great Britain and Ireland undertook a modified Delphi exercise during 2014 and 2015 to prioritise research questions for Bowel Disease in conjunction with the Bowel Disease Research Foundation. One of the top ten priority questions in non-cancer diseases was to investigate short and long term outcomes of minimally invasive approaches (e.g. percutaneous radiological drainage, laparoscopic washout and drainage) to managing complicated diverticulitis. The aim of our study will first be to provide contemporary population based estimates of the incidence of perforated diverticular disease and diverticular abscess and quantify the attributable mortality after adjustment for baseline comorbidity. Then, using the cohorts defined, we aim to report the use of minimally invasive treatment strategies and their outcomes in patients with complicated diverticular disease(CDD).","Objective 1: No outcome other than the occurrence of the disease is required for this analysis. 
Objective 2: Primary outcome measures are death and cause of death. Death will be defined based on recordings of death dates in CPRD, HES or ONS register. To define cause of death, the ONS death register would be used and underlying cause of death will be examined primarily categorized as ICD-10 chapter headings. 
Objective 3: Primary outcome measures are interventions and outcome of interventions ( readmission and reoperation). Using Linked HES data and OPCS codes, interventions undertaken following an admission with diverticular perforation or diverticular abscess will be identified. Identified interventions would be categorized into: 
1. Conservative treatment (no surgical intervention/antibiotics) 
2. Laparoscopic lavage 
3. Resectional surgery (Hartmann's or resection and anastomosis) 
4. Percutaneous drainage 

Using the same data, re-admission and surgical re-operation following conservative and minimally invasive interventions will be examined.","David James Humes - Chief Investigator - University of Nottingham

We want to describe the clinical and non-clinical determinants that predict why some adult patients take longer than others to be diagnosed with a brain tumour and its potential impact on care, health care costs and survival. Patients with brain tumours can have many different symptoms. Some symptoms are more alarming to patients than others. For example, a patient may be less concerned about a headache than a sudden weakness in their arm. A general practitioner will see lots of patients with similar symptoms, most of which will not have a brain tumour, which makes it hard to know who should be referred. Our research, and other related projects not using CPRD, will help produce guidelines for patients and general practitioners to better understand which patients may have a brain tumour and may led to future intervention studies to reduce any avoidable delays.","Delays in cancer diagnosis cause anxiety for patients and their family and may influence management and prognosis. The presenting symptoms of a brain tumour can be broadly divided into two groups. Firstly, non-specific symptoms e.g. headache and behavioural change. Secondly, specific focal neurological symptoms e.g. hemiparesis or seizures. Patients with non-specific symptoms may wait weeks before presenting to primary care and then for referral. Tumour growth during this period may limit the extent of surgical resection, which correlates with poor outcome. Our aim is to describe how patterns of primary care consultation and symptoms as well as socio-demographic factors relate to diagnosis, referral, hospital management and mortality. We will determine the predictive value of a combination of symptoms and socio-demographic factors ('red flags') to aid GPs in appropriate referral of patients for further investigation. We will compare the impact of GP delay in referral on clinical care in terms of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and subsequent repeat hospital admissions and mortality risk. Our descriptive findings will also contribute to a separate health economic modelling project estimating the costs and outcomes of different imaging and referral pathways.","(a) time until first hospital hospital admission

It affects 0.6% -1.0% of the general population. In addition, RA is associated with comorbidities such as cancer, heart disease, hypothyroidism and associates with an increased risk of death despite advances in treatment. While the association between RA and comorbidities has been examined in cross-sectional and prospective studies, it is not known whether RA increases the risk of developing comorbidities or if the comorbidities precede the onset of RA, and are a risk factor for developing RA. Thus, the overall purpose of this study is to assess the chronological relationship between RA and comorbidities. We will study all patients newly diagnosed with RA in CPRD between 1997 and 2005, and an equal number of people without RA. We will then examine the data to find out if they had a higher risk of having comorbidities 10 year, and 1 year before developing RA, and 10 years after they develop RA.","Objectives: To compare the burden of comorbidity between incident cases of RA and matched controls before and after the diagnosis of RA. Methods: A combined retrospective case-control and prospective cohort study. Incident RA cases will be sampled from the CPRD, and age, gender, practice and index date matched with a control without RA. Comorbidities within 10 years prior to and following the diagnosis of RA will be analysed. Data from linkages is not required in this study. Data analysis: For retrospective analysis, the prevalence of a specific comorbidity will be calculated using the number of people ever diagnosed with a given comorbidity during the past 10-year period or 1-year period before the index date as the numerator and the number of patients with incident RA or matched controls as denominators. ORs and 95% CIs will be used to estimate the association. Conditional logistic regression will be used to adjust for covariates.

A few studies conducted while mirabegron was being developed have raised concern that this drug may be associated with an increase in abnormal tissue growth and tumours, both cancerous and non-cancerous.  The objective of this research is to evaluate, in real-world practice in the United Kingdom, if there is an association between mirabegron use and cancer.  In this study, we will calculate and compare the occurrence of ten common cancers among new users of mirabegron and new users of several other medications commonly used to treat overactive bladder.","This will be a cohort study comparing the incidence of commonly occurring malignant neoplasms among new users of mirabegron and new users of any comparator antimuscarinic medication, as a group, used in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB).  
Incidence rates for sex-specific composite cancer endpoints will be calculated as follows: 
- Males: prostate, lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, melanoma of skin, urinary bladder, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, kidney and renal pelvis, and pancreas.
- Females: breast, lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, melanoma of skin, urinary bladder, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, kidney and renal pelvis, corpus uteri, and pancreas.
In addition, the incidence of the 10 individual cancers included in the composite endpoints will be estimated within each of the two exposure cohorts.  We will compare cancer incidence between mirabegron follow-up time and antimuscarinic follow-up time. For this comparison of neoplasm endpoints, potential confounders will be addressed and the outcomes will be modelled, accounting for differences in follow-up time between the cohorts. Adjustment for potential confounders will be performed by matching on PS to balance cohorts with respect to factors present at or before the time of cohort entry. We will express results as estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of each study outcome comparing mirabegron to the reference antimuscarinic medications.","The primary aims of the CPRD study are:.

- To estimate and compare the incidence of sex-specific composite cancer endpoints (1 for men and 1 for women) among new users of mirabegron and new users of any comparator antimuscarinic medication (as a group) used in the treatment of OAB, stratified into categories of cancers that occur up to 1 year following the start of treatment, and those that occur more than 1 year following the start of treatment. .

- To restrict the above analysis to patients aged 65 years and older..

- To estimate and compare the incidence of the 10 individual sex-specific cancers included in the composite cancer endpoints among new users of mirabegron and new users of any comparator antimuscarinic medication, stratified into categories of cancers that occur up to 1 year following the start of treatment, and those that occur more than 1 year following the start of treatment. .

For the primary objectives, sensitivity analyses to examine protopathic bias will be conducted by estimating and comparing incidence in post-treatment initiation intervals of 0 to < 6 months, 6 to < 12 months, 12 to < 24 months, and  24 months or more.

Several secondary aims will be evaluated for the sex-specific composite outcomes. Specifically, we will:.

- Estimate and compare the sex-specific composite outcomes while:.

- Stratifying by new user status (i.e., naive new users vs non-naive new users)..
- Excluding immunocompromised patients..
- Censoring person-time when a patient switches from antimuscarinic treatment to mirabegron..

- Estimate and compare the effect of cumulative exposure in tertiles of mirabegron cumulative dose relative to tertiles of antimuscarinic cumulative dose and within mirabegron exposure across tertiles of mirabegron cumulative dose.","Dr Alejandro Arana Navarro - Chief Investigator - RTI Health Solutions

However, safety results from a randomized controlled trial indicate that these drugs may be associated with colorectal cancer. To date, the association between aromatase inhibitors and colorectal cancer has not been examined in a real world setting. Thus, the aim of this study is to assess whether post-menopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer who are treated with aromatase inhibitors are at an increased risk of colorectal cancer in comparison to patients who are treated with tamoxifen.","A long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) has indicated that AIs may increase the risk of colorectal cancer in comparison with tamoxifen. To date, this is only RCT that has reported on the incidence of colorectal between aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen in post-menopausal women with breast cancer. Further, no observational studies have examined this association in clinical practice. Thus, the objective of this study is to use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to assess whether the use of aromatase inhibitors, when compared with tamoxifen, is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in a cohort of approximately 26,000 patients newly-diagnosed with breast cancer. The use of aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen will be treated as a time-varying variable, with exposures lagged by one year for latency considerations and to minimize reverse causality. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model will be used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) of incident colorectal cancer associated with use of AIs when compared with tamoxifen use. This study will address an important safety question in an older population already at increased risk of colorectal cancer.","Patients will be considered exposed to AIs or tamoxifen starting one year after the date of the first prescription until the end of follow-up. Lagging exposure by one year will be necessary given the possible diagnostic delays associated with colorectal cancer, to impose a minimum time period between exposure and the incidence of the colorectal cancer (latency), and minimize biases related to reverse causality (a situation where exposure might be initiated or terminated at early signs or symptoms of the outcome).","Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

A key indicator of future CKD is the albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR), which measures the amount of protein escaping from the kidney into the urine. It is regularly obtained through laboratory tests on patients' urine samples, ordered by GPs. There is some evidence that high values of ACR also predict future heart problems and stroke and may be associated with a reduced life expectancy. The strength of the association between ACR, and of recent increases in ACR, and major adverse health outcomes in the UK is unknown, and will be determined in the present study. Such information will enable more effective provision of health care resources and consequently reduce morbidity and delay death. We will estimate associations between ACR, and short-term changes in ACR, and future health by linking data from GP consultations, where ACR is measured, with data on (for example) heart disease from hospital records and death certificates. Since there are several other factors, e.g. smoking, that predispose to heart disease and other diseases of interest, we will account for these factors (also recorded at GP consultations) in our statistical analyses.","We will include patients with at least one ACR measure to estimate the association between ACR (after a log transformation, based on our prior work) and (for example) CVD using Cox proportional hazards models. We shall examine the patterns of association using splines and by estimating hazard ratios between ordinal groupings of ACR. Adjustments will be made for confounding variables and subgroup analyses undertaken. The UK population attributable risk for each of these outcomes associated with micro- and macro-albuminuria will be estimated. We will select subjects in CPRD who have at least two ACRs within about 3 years (the exposure window) to estimate the change in ACR by fitting a linear regression line for each subject. We will then use similar methods to estimate associations of change in ACR with CVD, but adjusting additionally for (1) the first ACR; (2) the last ACR within the window. We will alternatively estimate  change in ACR as the observed relative difference between the first ACR and that closest to 3 years later, for those with ACR measured after (approximately) 3 years. The length of the exposure window will be varied in sensitivity analyses. Missing values will be imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations.","Renal outcomes will be derived as in our previous work in CPRD, using an algorithm incorporating death certificates, inpatient diagnostic or procedural codes, and primary care diagnostic/laboratory test results, and applying standard CKD definitions and creatinine-based CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) estimated GFR (eGFR) formulae25. CKD stages G4-G5 will be accepted if there were at least two eGFR measurements <30mL/min/1.73m2, spaced by at least 90 days, with no eGFR result >30mL/min/1.73m2 in the intervening period. The ESRD outcome will comprised those who died with mention of ESRD, or underwent kidney transplantation or maintenance dialysis (which was distinguished from acute dialysis by a record of CKD stage 5, permanent arteriovenous dialysis access or peritoneal dialysis). We have previously validated this algorithm using UK-renal registry data. CVD will be defined using primary care and linked HES and ONS mortality data using CALIBER definitions. Cardiovascular mortality will be defined as a death with Underlying Cause of Death attributed to a vascular cause (ICD-10 codes I00-I99 excluding I85) or sudden death (R96).

Some medicines may be inappropriate if they have been used for too long or their harms outweigh their benefits. Doctors are expected to manage medications and are paid to hold an annual dementia care review with every patient. We do not know what effect these opportunities to review medication have on quality of care, an important part of which is reducing the amount of medicines that may be harmful in people with dementia. Detailed medication recommendations have been created to help health professionals reduce harmful prescriptions. We have used these guides to select four groups of medications that may be inappropriate for people with dementia. They are antipsychotic medications, tricyclic antidepressants, anticholinergics (defined according to Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale score = 3) and proton pump inhibitors. We will look at how often these medicines are prescribed and the impact of dementia annual reviews and other medication reviews on their use, using GP records of all people with dementia available in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in 2014 and 2015.","Objective: To estimate the (i) prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use, and overall medication burden among people with dementia between 2015 and 2016 (ii) and the factors associated with potentially inappropriate medication use, in particular the effect of medication reviews and dementia annual review. Methods. A 2-year cohort study following all prevalent cases of dementia at the start date of 01/01/2015, and incident cases between the start date and the study end date of 31/12/2016. Prescriptions of four classes of potentially inappropriate medications (antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, anticholinergics and proton pump inhibitors) will be extracted, as well as any medication review or dementia annual review (exposures) during that period and potentially confounding variables. Statistical analysis. We will estimate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use in people with dementia across the study period. McNemar and Wilcoxon signed rank tests will test the change in each outcome before and after a medication review or dementia annual review. Multilevel logistic regression analyses will then be used to estimate the factors associated with each outcome, and in particular the effect of medication review or dementia annual review on subsequent prescriptions controlling for age, sex, time varying comorbidity, area-level deprivation, GP practice and exception from QOF dementia indicators.","We will extract prescription records for the selected potentially inappropriate medications, defined using World Health Organisation Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) codes. The presence of each of the following PIMs will be coded within each of 12 2-month time periods between January 2015 and December 2016 for each patient conditional on their inclusion in the study for the whole of that period. 
1. Antipsychotic medication will be defined using ATC code N0A5A. 
2. Tricyclic antidepressants will be defined using ATC codes. Antidepressants (ATC N06A) are grouped into tricyclic antidepressant sub-type, according to ATC cross-referenced with the British National Formulary (BNF) to identify those used in UK practice (ATC N06AA02, N06AA03, N06AA04, N06AA06, N06AA07, N06AA09, N06AA10, N06AA12, N06AA16, N06AX03 and N06AX05). 
3. Definite anticholinergic medication will be defined as any medication with an Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) score of 3. An ACB=3 score indicates medications with definite anticholinergic activity and severe negative cognitive effects. 
4. Proton pump inhibitors are implicated as potentially inappropriate, according to Beer's and STOPP criteria when they are used to treat peptic ulcer disease at maximum therapeutic dose for >8 weeks. Their use will be defined using ATC code A02BC, at maximum dose and the presence of a Read code indicating peptic ulcer disease (J13y200, J13z.00, 12E1.00, 14C1.00, J130200, J13y100, J13..00). 
5. A binary indicator representing the use of any of the above PIMs 
6. A continuous indicator of the total number of prescribed medicines within the 2-month time periods. This will include all prescribed medications but exclude devices, dressings and topical preparations.

All health outcomes will be measured as the presence of a prescription at any point within the 2-month time periods.","Dr George Savva - Chief Investigator - University of East Anglia

Based on US data, 3,400 women with lupus are admitted to the hospital each year for childbirth and many deliver seemingly healthy babies.  The maternal changes that occur during pregnancy are substantial and biologic observations suggest that Systemic Lupus Erythematosus may influence the development of the fetus.  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus during pregnancy has been associated with childhood dyslexia;   maternal cells have been detected with higher frequency in cardiac specimens of patients with neonatal lupus syndrome; and immunosuppressants, such as those used to treat SLE, have been linked to a reduced effect of the tetanus vaccine in children.    Thus, studies have shown interaction between the mother and fetal development.  We postulate that a mother with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus will have a child with a weaker immune system, thus, at higher risk for infection, compared to a child born to a healthy mother.

Studies suggest statins may also slightly increase diabetes, which has a contradictory increase in heart disease. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and death are much higher than the general population, but there is little known as to whether statins have the same positive and negative effects in RA despite their common use. Our study will examine the net effects of statins in RA patients and compare them with the general population by using routinely collected health information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We will first identify RA patients who have started statins. We will compare diabetes and heart disease risks of these patients with the general population (statin-user and non-user patients without RA) and statin non-user RA patients to see whether the effects of statins in RA are similar to the general population. We also expect to learn whether or not statins increase diabetes risk and if the overall heart disease benefit outweighs this negative diabetes risk.","Statins decrease cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality while increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite their frequent use, the net effect of statins in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in which insulin resistance, T2DM, CV, and overall mortality risks are already increased due to chronic inflammation and glucocorticoid use, have not been evaluated comprehensively. We will compare effects of statins on incident T2DM, CV events, and mortality in RA patients in comparison with non-RA patients in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Statin-initiator RA patients without T2DM will be identified and each will be matched (1:5) with statin non-initiator RA patients, statin-initiator and non-initiator non-RA patients based on age, sex, study period, body mass index, other comorbidities and medications influencing the development of T2DM, CV events, and mortality. Cox proportional hazard models will be constructed to assess the statin-associated risks and benefits in each group. We will also calculate numbers needed to treat and harm with statins for each group. We will determine if statins increase T2DM risk with a more significant improvement in CV morbidity and mortality in RA patients, and identify potential risk factors for T2DM development with statins.

In the UK, men are more affected than women, while the situation in US is reversed.
Although COPD has been considered traditionally a disease of ""elderly men"", both prevalence and mortality rates have increased more in women than in men in the last years, and the number of new cases of COPD is growing nearly three times faster in women than in men. 
Despite a growing body of evidence conducted in real world settings examining key disease features such as the rate of lung function deterioration, annual rate of exacerbation, severity of exacerbations, and other important disease features, only few have systematically examined gender differences across these features.

We must first understand the number of incidences of diagnosis for lower back pain in the UK annually over a period of 20 years. The CPRD provides the most robust long-term data on trends which indicates the total UK population diagnosed with LBP annually, broken down by age and gender.

This study will obtain age specific incidence rates on an annual basis (from 1994 to 2013) from the CPRD database. Incidence rates for back pain will be estimated using aggregated counts for new incidences as numerator and person years as denominator. Confidence intervals will be estimated using the binomial distribution (unless working with small values, in which case a partial distribution will be used to estimate the confidence intervals).

Studies have shown that obesity is closely linked to type 2 diabetes in general, while the link between excess body weight and length and cost of hospital stay for complications related to diabetes are less described in the literature. We want to investigate if body weight in terms of body mass index (BMI, classified as underweight, normal, pre-obese, obese class I, II and III) measured at the time of admission to the hospital influences the length and the cost of the stay at the hospital. For specific complications to Type 2 diabetes and for specific procedures to treat the complications, we want to investigate the relation between the mentioned categories of BMI and the length and cost of the stay at the hospital. Examples of complications include amongst others heart failure angioplasty (widening of blocked or narrowed coronary arteries), non fatal stroke, lower limb amputation and renal complications.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease characterized by the body's inability to produce sufficient insulin and/or properly use insulin. Overweight and obesity are closely linked to T2DM and increased body weight could potentially increase the risk of some diabetes related complications as well as the length of a hospital admission. For hospital admissions among people with T2DM , we will investigate the association between body weight (pre-hospitalisation body mass index, BMI) and hospitalisations in terms of the outcomes length of stay (LoS) and cost of stay (CoS). Hospital admissions will be classified according to pre-specified complication-related diagnoses/procedures. The effect of BMI categories will be modelled for each outcome separately using regression analysis for a) each pre-specified complication-related diagnosis/procedure, and b) overall, including the hospital admission classification as covariates. For the regression analysis, we will use Generalised Linear Models (GLMs), with normal distribution for LoS and for CoS a gamma model with logarithmic link function. We will also investigate the effect of BMI as a continuous variable and using alternative BMI categorisations. Finally, we will evaluate the effect of BMI, controlling for other covariates.","For each hospitalisation (each spell) we will derive the outcomes LoS and CoS.

However, there have been recent safety concerns of its use in unapproved indications (e.g. lactation issues in breastfeeding) and increases in cardiac adverse events. In March 2013, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), responsible for assessing and monitoring the safety of human medicines, initiated a review of domperidone-containing medicines. As a result, PRAC recommended that the product label be updated to strengthen the information regarding cardiac risks. PRAC also requested that domperidone's marketing authorisation holders (MAHs) perform a drug utilisation study to assess the effectiveness of these measures to reduce the occurrence or severity of these cardiac adverse events associated with domperidone use and to monitor the use of the drug for unapproved indications. The EMA suggested the use of a healthcare database as a data source to measure domperidone utilisation patterns pre- and post-implementation of these measures. This study is being conducted to assess if there are demonstrable differences in prescribing practices of domperidone before and after the implementation of these measures. This will then be used to inform the EMA as to the effectiveness of such measures.","This study will use primary care data from CPRD to describe the drug utilisation patterns of domperidone pre- and post-implementation of the risk minimisation measures in 2014. Data analysis will be descriptive and presented using appropriate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation and range for continuous variables and percent and frequency tables for categorical variables. Endpoints such as daily dose, duration of use, and prescribing for off-label indications will be measured for both groups. Additionally, estimates of the overall proportion of domperidone prescriptions before and after the risk minimisation implementation will be used to generate a risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals for each of the components of the composite endpoints individually, the time trend of apparent indication, days supplied (<7 days vs. >7 days), and the age and sex of the people receiving prescriptions. To account for the uncertainty around unknown indication and duration of use the rates for the endpoints will be calculated four ways from optimistic scenario (unknown indication on label usage for <7 days) and pessimistic scenario (unknown indication assumed to be off-label usage for >7 days), plus other intermediate scenarios.","Demographics: Information on patients'age, sex, and geographic region will be extracted. Diagnoses will be extracted from a read codes or will be determined based on laboratory test results. 

Indication: Estimated from the diagnoses recorded in the time period preceding each domperidone prescription:

In the United Kingdom, there are five types of statins available to patients at a range of doses and regimens; their effectiveness in reducing LDL-C as evaluated in clinical trials (published 1985 - 2003) informs current guidelines of their usage in patients at risk of cardiovascular events. Over time population change, generally for the better, for example, prevalence of smoking has continuously decreased since 1970 (HSCIC, 2016), therefore it is of interest to revisit past estimates of statin effectiveness in reducing LDL-C.

The main objective of this study is to determine the extent and impact of variation in statin treatment regimens on LDL-C and cardiovascular events on a national scale using linked electronic health records.

Methods
A retrospective longitudinal cohort study of statin usage and clinically relevant endpoints between 1997 and 2016 will be used to (1) match patients groups used in clinical trials to replicate statin dose-response characteristics; (2) extend this group to a more generalizable population at risk of CVD to understand how they are managed and respond in clinical practice. 

Data analysis
Subjects will be selected based on their likeness to clinical trial participants at both individual and all trial levels. Statin persistence will be assessed through repeated prescriptions and LDL-C measurements. Comparative effectiveness between patient treatment strategies will be evaluated by identifying major pathways given patient indications and observance of the time-appropriate national guidelines.","1.

However, access to smoking cessation therapies for older smokers may be hindered by a variety of factors.  Previous qualitative studies have found negative opinions and sceptical attitudes amongst older smokers regarding smoking cessation therapies such as nicotine replacement therapy and psychological counselling, or that they would be able to successfully quit smoking, regardless of the method.  Moreover, studies have found GPs to be reluctant to offer quitting advise and/or prescribe various smoking cessation therapies to older smokers.  We have completed an analysis of the English Smoking Tool Kit survey and found that older smokers, whilst less nicotine dependent, were less likely to raise smoking with their GPs. Similarly GPs were less likely to refer older smokers to cessation services or provide nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs). This may or may not be appropriate given co-morbidities and life expectancy but we could not examine this within that dataset. We therefore want to use data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to examine demographic and clinical factors that may determine smoking cessation therapies amongst older smokers and whether this may or may not reflect inequitable access to services.","We have completed an analysis of the English Smoking Tool Kit survey and found that older smokers, whilst less nicotine dependent, were less likely to raise smoking with their GPs. Similarly GPs were less likely to refer older smokers to cessation services or provide NRTs. We could not examine whether this may or may not be appropriate given co-morbidities and life expectancy. The main objective of this study is to examine factors associated with the provision and uptake of smoking cessation therapies and to identify if there is inequitable access to these therapies amongst older smokers.  We plan to use CPRD data to conduct a cohort study of patients who are smokers at baseline.  Exposure will be defined as smoking status of current smoker. We will use competing risk survival analysis  to investigate whether age of patients predicts receiving any prescription or referral for smoking cessation therapies (pharmacological, counselling, or multiple therapies) adjusting for potential confounders. We will explore whether there is evidence that therapies were used and whether prescription of smoking cessation therapies led to long term smoking cessation. We will specifically examine whether high levels of co-morbidity and/or limited life expectancy explain older patients are less actively managed.","- To examine whether previous findings, that older smokers are less likely to be offered therapies for smoking cessation are replicated in CPRD. Assuming that this is the case, our main aim is to determine whether this may be clinically appropriate as older patients will have more co-morbidity and shorter life expectancy so it may not be felt valuable to try to help them to quit at this stage in their life. In this way we aim to see if smoking cessation therapies are or are not being made available to older people in an equitable fashion.

Specific Aims:.

- To investigate whether older smokers are as likely as younger smokers to receive referrals and/or prescriptions for smoking cessation therapies; whether types of therapies offered are similar (i.e. pharmacological from the GP, GP advice, referral to a smoking cessation service, or multiple therapies), and whether there are any differences by:

It occurs when the liver has been damaged so badly that it can no longer repair itself and stops working properly. This can result from drinking too much alcohol, a fatty diet or a long-term liver infection such as hepatitis; a variety of conditions which lead to liver damage. The liver plays an important role in the function of other body organs and systems, such as the heart and immune system. Therefore, examining the performance of these may help to indicate how ill the patient is due to cirrhosis. The aim of this study is to observe the time to death and develop a formula to predict survival in cirrhosis patients, taking into account the different organs and body systems affected by the liver disease. Since cirrhosis is often diagnosed late, many patients die soon after they are diagnosed with the disease; therefore, the study will be split into two parts, looking at death within three months of diagnosis and in the longer term.","We aim to model mortality in patients with cirrhosis while adjusting for a number of contributing factors. From a population of research-quality patients in CPRD eligible for linkage to HES data, we will identify patients with cirrhosis using Read and ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Admissions indicating decompensating events will be identified from HES using ICD-10 codes. In order to model mortality in cirrhosis patients, two statistical models will be created, a logistic regression and a time-dependent survival model. The logistic regression will predict death within three months of diagnosis of cirrhosis while adjusting for a number of laboratory results and prior events (including events that would indicate failure or deterioration of bodily organs). A time-dependent model will be run for patients that survived more than three months adjusting for laboratory results and cumulative admissions for decompensating events on a monthly basis.","Patients with cirrhosis will be sampled from the CPRD clinical and referral tables by Read code, and from HES data using ICD-10 codes.

When the enzyme is missing or at low levels, bones and teeth are weak and may not grow properly, with effects not only the skeleton, but also breathing and brain development; also, unused calcium and phosphate can accumulate in the body, damaging the kidneys and other body systems. The severity of HPP is generally related to the age at which the disease became apparent: the form diagnosed at or before birth can be fatal, while forms diagnosed in adults and older children are milder.

Of these, there are 3.9 million cases in the UK. As a highly prevalent disease, 12% of the global budget for health research is devoted to diabetes, and through this research there have been many drugs developed to treat type 2 diabetes. A newer class of drugs, the incretin-based drugs, were introduced into the UK market in 2007. These drugs have been found to assist in weight loss, while lowering blood sugar to optimal levels. However, there are some concerns that the incretin-based drugs might increase the risk of colon cancer. To date no study has investigated the association between incretin-based drugs and colon cancer. Given the popularity of incretin-based drugs in the type 2 diabetic population, there is an urgent need to assess this risk. This study will investigate whether the use of incretin-based drugs is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This study will provide much needed information of this potential association, which will be of value to regulatory agencies, physicians, and patients.","The literature offers discrepant findings as to whether the use of incretin-based drugs is associated with colon cancer incidence. There is evidence that the GLP-1 pathway may be involved in the development of colon cancer by promoting gut growth and crypt fission. However, in a post-hoc analysis of the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial, the use of the DPP-4i, saxaglipitin, was associated with a 49% decreased risk of colon cancer. Further investigation is required to determine the true association. This study will assess this association by assembling a cohort of patients, at least 40 years of age, newly-treated with antidiabetic drugs between January 1, 1988 and March 31, 2015, with follow up until March 31, 2016. The use of incretin based drugs will be modelled as a time-varying variable, where patients will be considered unexposed to incretin-based drugs until one year after the first prescription for latency purposes. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of colon cancer associated with the use of incretin-based drugs.

Studies have shown that 5ARIs improve the symptoms of enlarged prostate and decrease the need for surgery. However, the hormonal changes that result from their use may lead to heart failure. The majority of data regarding the effects of 5ARIs on the heart are from clinical trials. To date, no high-quality studies have assessed their effects in a real-world setting. Therefore, we will examine this question in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database, linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database, which records hospitalizations, and the Office of National Statistics (ONS) database, which records deaths. We will study all patients with enlarged prostates and classify them as those treated with 5ARIs, those treated with alpha-blockers (alternative therapies for enlarged prostate), and those not treated with medications. We will then compare the number of men hospitalized for heart failure, heart attack, or stroke, or that die of heart-related causes between each treatment group. We will thus be able to determine if 5ARI use has harmful cardiovascular effects relative to alpha-blocker use or non-use of medications.","5ARIs are used for the treatment of BPH. They reduce prostate size by lowering levels of dihydrotestosterone, an androgen which promotes prostate growth. Studies in basic science and epidemiology have repeatedly associated decreased androgen levels with adverse effects on cardiovascular disease and markers for cardiovascular risk; however, the cardiovascular effects of 5ARIs have not been well-researched. Data on this topic derive predominately from clinical trials and their meta-analyses, which are limited by imprecise effect estimates and poor generalisability. We will thus conduct a population-based retrospective cohort study using the CPRD (linked with the HES and ONS) to investigate the cardiovascular effects of 5ARIs. We will study all patients with BPH in the CPRD from April 1998 to March 2016 and classify them into mutually-exclusive, time-dependent exposure categories: users of 5ARIs, users of alpha-blockers (alternative therapies for BPH), and non-users of BPH medications. BPH patients will be followed from diagnosis until hospitalization for heart failure or censoring. Secondary outcomes will include myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and a composite cardiac failure endpoint. The effects of 5ARI use versus non-use (primary comparator) or alpha-blocker use (secondary comparator) will be estimated using marginal structural Cox models adjusted for high-dimensional propensity scores.","Heart failure;

Whereas VKA are well studied, the effectiveness and safety of NOAC are less well established. Using real-world information from the UK, this study will compare how effective NOAC and VKA are in preventing stroke in patients with AF. This study will also compare how frequently these two types of anticoagulants cause undesirable side effects such as uncontrolled bleeding. In addition to evaluating the general AF population, this study will also examine subgroups of vulnerable AF patients who experience a higher risk of stroke and/or bleeding side effects. These include those who have already had a previous stroke, and those with chronic kidney disease.

Few studies have investigated this potential harmful effect, and these studies have found mixed results, with some studies finding increases in lung cancer risk while others reporting no difference. Given these discrepancies, new well conducted studies are needed to assess if this risk is substantiated.

However, to what extent the control of blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol levels during the course of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) modulates this relationship is to date largely unclear. Furthermore, the temporal association between the onset of dementia and the presence of diabetes-related complications affecting small and large blood vessels is not well studied. The aim of this study is to characterise temporal changes in blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol during a 12-year follow-up of people with T2D, and compare metabolic changes in people who did and did not develop dementia. We also aim to determine the association between blood glucose levels, other vascular risk factors, complications of diabetes and the occurrence of dementia and its outcomes using a large national database. We will use the data to explore whether these associations differ by age, gender and ethnicity.","This study will be a retrospective open cohort study of adults with Type 2 Diabetes from the CPRD. Dementia-free adults with Type 2 Diabetes over the age of 45 years will be followed up from 1 April 2004 to 30 September 2016. The primary outcome if interest will be the diagnosis of dementia (categorised as vascular dementia, Alzheimer's dementia or other dementia). We will characterise the retrospective trajectories of glycated haemoglobin, cholesterol and blood pressure among patient who develop and those who do not develop dementia during the study period. Multilevel growth models will be utilised to compare trajectories of the metabolic parameters in the dementia and non-dementia groups. Patients will be categorised according to HbA1c, SBP, DBP and lipid measure segments and we will use survival analyses to estimate the risk of dementia by levels of metabolic parameters. Survival analyses will be used to assess the link between microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular disease (AMI, stroke, TIA and death due to acute CVD events) and the development of dementia. We will further assess the association between these parameters and survival after the diagnosis of dementia. Subgroup analyses by ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation, sex and the presence of hypertension will be performed.","Dementia - To ascertain the development of dementia during the study period in the initially dementia-free cohort of patients with T2D, the presence of diagnostic read codes for vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer's dementia and other non-vascular forms of dementia will be identified using 1. Diagnostic read codes from primary care records; 2. Prescription data from primary care records; 3. HES data including primary and secondary diagnostic codes on admission; 4. ONS mortality data; 5. MMSE scores using primary care data. Death - Date and cause of death. Diagnostic codes will be used to triangulate dementia diagnosis.

The hypotheses are that live vaccines (containing a weakened form of the virus, e.g. measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine or BCG) could provide wider protection against other infections, but this potential extra benefit is diminished by also giving inactivated (non-live) vaccines such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP). However, evidence for non-specific effects of vaccines is unclear. This study will investigate whether the frequency of infections is reduced in young children who receive live vaccines, and whether this effect is modified by giving inactivated vaccines. We will look at the effects of two live vaccines (BCG, given near birth, and MMR, given to toddlers) and the inactivated vaccines given to infants and toddlers (the 5-in-1 DTP-polio-Hib vaccine, Meningitis C and pneumococcal vaccines). Frequency of infections will be investigated a) in infancy, comparing individuals' risk of infection after receiving BCG with their risk after additionally receiving inactivated vaccines, and b) in the second year of life before and after receiving MMR, for two time periods: up to August 2006 (MMR given alone), and September 2006 onwards (MMR given alongside inactivated vaccines).","This project will investigate aspects of 'non-specific effects' of vaccination; the hypothesised associations between live vaccines and a reduction in the number of infections, and between inactivated vaccines and an increase in the number of infections. Investigations will, in part, take advantage of change in vaccine schedules over time, and thus changes in the order in which live and inactivated vaccines are given. We will use the self-controlled case series method to compare the within-person relative incidence of a range of infections after receipt of inactivated vaccines compared to incidence after live vaccines. First, among infants given BCG (live) vaccine shortly after birth, we will investigate the relative incidence of infections in the first year of life, comparing incidence before and after receipt of the primary schedule of inactivated vaccines. Second, we will analyse the relative incidence of infections in the second year of life before and after receipt of MMR (live) vaccine, and we will compare whether this effect varies between two time periods; up to August 2006 when only MMR vaccine was given, and September 2006 onwards when MMR (live), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (inactivated) and Meningitis C/Hib (inactivated) vaccines were given at the same time.","We will examine a range of infection groups, recorded in either CPRD or in HES. These will include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, acute gastroenteritis, joint and bone infections, skin infections, neurological infections, eye infections, other bacterial and viral infections, and sepsis. These will be defined using Read and ICD10 code lists, updating the existing code lists we have used in previous ISAC approved studies of infections (for example, ISAC protocols 09-061RA, 11_033A, 15_146).

In some people, SSc affects only the skin. But in many people, SSc also harms structures beyond the skin - such as blood vessels, internal organs and the digestive tract. Signs and symptoms vary, depending on which structures are affected. SSc is associated with conditions such as interstitial lung disease, which is an inflammation of the lungs that causes severe scarring, with the highest rates of death among patients with both SSc and interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). Currently there are no disease-specific drug treatments for SSc-ILD. Developing treatments to effectively manage patients with SSc-ILD may lead to improvements in overall health outcomes among these patients. This study aims to assess the amount of interactions patients have with healthcare professionals and how much these interactions may costs among patients with SSc-ILD. The results from this study will help to describe the clinical and financial burden of SSc-ILD in real-world settings and demonstrate the existing unmet needs of patients with SSc-ILD.","Published research suggests that the burden of Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD), both clinical and economic, is substantial; however, evidence regarding characteristics of patients with SSc-ILD is limited, as are assessments of health care resource utilisation and costs incurred during management of SSc-ILD. This study aims to assess healthcare resource utilisation and costs among patients with SSc-ILD. Demographics, comorbidities and medication history will be described for the cohort of SSc patients and the sub-cohorts of ILD and for patients with other organ involvement (OOI). Health care resource utilisation and costs will be summarised for the overall study sample and for the SSc-ILD SSc-OOI sub-cohorts stratified by service setting, cause of use (SSc/non-SSc related), and by treatment type. We will also conduct multivariable regression analyses using backwards selection methods to examine predictors of adjusted total all-cause and SSc-related health care costs. The results derived from this non-interventional study based on existing data will help quantify the clinical and economic burden of SSc-ILD in real-world settings and demonstrate the existing unmet needs among patients with SSc-ILD. Furthermore, results may be included as inputs in future economic models developed for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of SSc-ILD treatment options.",#NAME?,"Dr Chris D Poole - Chief Investigator - Digital Health Labs Limited

For example, patients might have other diseases that have a bigger risk of death than the disease being studied.  To take into account of all these other factors can become complicated, given the increasing number of co-existing illnesses that people have in our ageing population. Therefore, researchers often use a combined measure of the disease burden for each patient to produce a score that predicts their risk of death. This can then be used in studies to adjust for any underlying differences in risk of death that the patients have.
The purpose of this study is to produce a new method for summarising the burden of life limiting disease that each patient has, given the increased amount of information available in linked primary care and secondary care data. In particular I will use novel methods that systematically assess the patterns in combinations of diseases rather than just simple counts of diseases. This will provide a better tool for researchers to use in studies using databases like the CPRD.","Identifying patterns of co-morbidity that predict patient groups with reduced survival can identify risk groupings that can be used to adjust for case mix. However, the quantity of clinical coding in linked routine datasets means that systematically assessing each potential combination through traditional statistical methods is not feasible. Previous work has used Bayesian information sharing between similar codes in a fixed a priori hierarchy. This current proposal will use supervised learning to identify a bespoke hierarchy, allowing codes from different disease categories to be grouped together. The method uses latent Dirichlet allocation to learn a latent distribution for these categories. This has been adapted to be supervised by a penalised Cox proportional hazards model predicting mortality will be fitted using cyclical coordinate descent so as to be stable with high dimensional data. In particular, this topic modelling method allows for heterogeneous sub groups for which different combinations of predictors might be relevant. This better reflects the case mix of patients in the general population and might therefore should better adjust for this case mix in future studies.",Dates of all-cause mortality for the whole cohort will be extracted from the linked data using the Office of National Statistics death register. All deaths in England are coded and recorded in the Office of National Statistics Death register from death certificates using the standardised rules established by WHO.

They are also more likely to be diagnosed with a learning disability, in particular attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One study suggested that self-belief in these younger children was lower than their older peers. In this study we aim to confirm the association between relative school age and diagnosis of learning disability and ADHD in a large national database. We will further investigate whether relatively young children within the school year are more likely to be diagnosed with depression in childhood. For each of these conditions we will also explore whether this association is affected by gender or ethnicity. If children who are relatively young in their school year are more likely to be diagnosed with a learning disability or depression this would have implications for both school and health services, from providing support to the youngest in the cohort, to considering relative age in the diagnosis of both learning disabilities and depression.","This observational study will explore the association between month of birth relative to school entry cut-off age and three outcomes: diagnosis of learning disability, diagnosis of ADHD and diagnosis of depression in children up until the age of 16 years. All children up to 16 years of age in up to standard practices will be included in the study. Relative age compared to the oldest of the school cohort will be calculated by comparing month of birth with the school entry cut-off. This will be categorised into four 3-month relative age bands. Cox regression will be used to determine the relative rate of each diagnosis by relative age band. Age in years, year of birth, socioeconomic status (measured by practice level IMD) will be considered potential confounders and gender and ethnicity and will be considered as potential effect modifiers. The above analyses will be used to estimate the population attributable risk from relative age and the number of 5 year olds entering school now who will receive a diagnosis as a result of their relative age in the school year.","Incidence of learning disability;

More than 1.7 million admissions in NHS hospitals in the UK annually are related to cardiovascular disease. There is however a lack of recent data on the characteristics of patients suffering from heart attacks, and what the risks are for having another heart attack or other cardiovascular disease (for example stroke) after having your first heart attack. Treatments to prevent subsequent cardiovascular disease may cause bleeding as a side effect. It is therefore important to understand what the risks of cardiovascular disease and bleeding events are and what leads some people to have additional cardiovascular or bleeding events so future research can try to prevent such events. The aims of this study are therefore to investigate the profile of patients having a heart attack, to quantify subsequent cardiovascular disease and bleeding events in these patients, to investigate risk factors for these events, and to understand the overall benefit treatments may provide for such patients.","Patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) are at substantial risk of future atherothrombotic events (e.g., repeated MI, stroke, and cardiovascular [CV] death). Antithrombotic therapy is widely used to reduce the risk of subsequent ischemic events, but is known to increase the risk of bleeding among treated patients. A new treatment for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events, called vorapaxar, has completed phase 3 trials in 2012. It is unclear how much the randomized controlled trial population, differs from the general population, how this subsequently impacts atherothrombotic risks, and how antithrombotic treatment may benefit patients in the real-world setting. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate risks of subsequent atherothrombotic and bleeding events in patients with prior MI, matched and unmatched to those patients eligible for the vorapaxar trial, to determine risk factors for these events in these populations, and to quantify net clinical benefit of antithrombotic treatment in the real-world setting.

There are different therapy types, which depend on the symptoms experienced by an individual. Although all these treatments are effective in managing menopausal symptoms, they have a rare, but serious side effect- an increased risk of blood clots. A recently issued guideline from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) stressed that research results from studies trying to estimate risk of developing blood clots as a result of HRT are still not clear, and that the findings are not a good basis for decision-making by doctors or patients. This study will investigate real-life use of and risks from all types of hormone therapy. We will use prescription records and also take into account patient characteristics and health conditions which might affect the risk of blood clots to ensure that our results properly demonstrate the effects of the different therapies.

In patients with reduced bone strength, fractures frequently happen after a simple fall or another minor accident. Statins are drugs which lower blood lipid levels and which are prescribed to prevent heart attacks and strokes. In the United Kingdom, approximately 11% of the population are prescribed statins. Experiments in animals suggest that statins may reduce bone fragility by strengthening the bone. In a previous CPRD-based study by our group, which was published in 2000, we observed a decreased rate of fractures in statin users. These results led to a controversial scientific debate, and various subsequent studies have found contradictory results. Several other studies also reported a decreased probability to break a bone in statin users, while more recent studies did not confirm this association. We aim to perform another study to address this same question (i.e. is the probability for a fracture the same in statin-users and non-users?) using the same data source, but using a more advanced, sophisticated study design.","There has been an ongoing scientific discussion over the past two decades, about whether or not statins reduce the risk of fragility fractures. This discussion was triggered by results from observational studies, one of which was a CPRD-based nested case-control analysis from our group, in which we reported a 45% decreased relative risk of fractures in statin users. More recent studies, including some randomized clinical trials, did not reproduce this finding and reported a null-association. We therefore aim to re-assess the relative risk of fracture associated with new statin use (a prior 3 years statin-free history is required), using CPRD data in a propensity score (PS)-matched sequential cohort study. Statin initiators will be matched to non-initiators on their PS within 2 year entry blocks (to avoid time trend bias). We will follow all patients from the day of a first statin prescription for 5 years, or until they have a recorded fracture, change of exposure status, or until they are otherwise censored. We will perform subgroup analyses by sex, age, daily statin dose, and by duration of follow-up.

Side effects can develop within days (e.g. mental illness) or after prolonged use (e.g. high blood pressure). Side effects can have a major impact on quality of life, independence and wellbeing, particularly as people get older, and lead to many hidden costs to the individual and the healthcare system.
For many conditions there are no approved alternatives to steroids and it is important we obtain accurate information about the side effects of treatment and the full costs of these to the individual and the NHS. This information is very helpful in building a strong case to support the introduction of new treatment, which have been shown to be effective in clinical trials, into the NHS.

With CPRD data we intend to develop new methods that allow clinicians and policy makers to balance risks and benefits of steroid treatment in patients with common long-lasting diseases. This will be achieved first by describing the side effects and what makes these more likely to happen; and then developing methods that help to identify patients at higher risk of developing side effects.","The aim of this research is to develop tools that enable clinicians and policy decision makers to balance harms and benefits of glucocorticoids for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. This will be achieved through; 1) description of glucocorticoid toxicity profiles and its predictors; and 2) development of treatment stratification tools for clinical evaluation to accurately identify patients at increased risk of developing toxicity. This research will enable informed personalised adaptation of treatment for patients identified with high risk of toxicity (e.g. earlier dose reduction or use of glucocorticoid-sparing therapies), improvement of clinical guidelines and quality of care and equity in health care provision, ultimately improving long-term patient outcomes. 

To estimate toxicity rates and describe toxicity patterns we will expand our phenotyping work to identify patients with common chronic inflammatory diseases and adverse events. The description of common patterns of toxicity, overall and in patients with different underlying diseases and age groups, and the exploration of the relative importance of duration of medication and dose will inform the construction of risk prediction models to enable patient risk stratification according to risk of toxicity development and the future development of decision cost-models to guide policy and clinical decision making.","Glucocorticoid toxicity

At the moment we are facing a crisis in public health.  The bacteria are becoming more resistant to the antibiotics and as a result they are becoming less effective, in the future there's a chance they might stop working completely.  
One of the reasons for this is over-prescription.  Antibiotics are being given out too often and the bacteria are becoming immune to them.  This project, delivered by the Greater Manchester Connected Health Cities (CHC), is developing a tech savvy solution to help understand and tackle the problem.
By making better use of health data and presenting this in a more powerful way the researchers working on this project believe they can start to reduce the UK's reliance on antibiotics.  
By accessing anonymous GP records the team will be able to understand which services are prescribing the most antibiotics and also understand the consequences of these prescriptions.  All of this data is kept in the medical records and by applying the latest computer programming the information can be sent to a secure environment to be analysed.","Antibiotics are important medicines for treating bacteria and are losing their effectiveness at an increasing rate. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the drivers for antibiotic prescribing and to analyse short-term health outcomes after antibiotic prescribing. We plan to conduct a population-based cohort study, consisting of patients of any age who were prescribed an antibiotic  for incidental use during 2000-2016. Incidental antibiotic use is defined as the prescribing of an antibiotic without any antibiotic prescribing in the previous three months.
Traditionally, antibiotic over-prescribing has been analysed by studying a select infectious disease and assessing whether the prescribed antibiotic was the correct type and dose. However, this study will use a different approach. First, a recently developed analytical strategy will be used to identify clusters of diagnostic data (READ codes) associated with  antibiotic prescribing. The results of the cluster analysis will be used to match incidental antibiotic users to non-users based on READ codes, age and gender. In this new matched dataset we will evaluate risk factors (medical, socio-economic) for antibiotic prescribing on the patient and practice level using multi-level analyses. In further analyses we will aim to identify factors associated with the variability in the rate of antibiotic prescribing between different general practices by using time-series analysis techniques.  Furthermore, we will compare antibiotic users and non-users for the incidence of infection-related hospital admissions in the 30 days after prescription and for antibiotic-related side-effects using survival analysis methods.","The main objective of this study is to evaluate the drivers for antibiotic prescribing in UK general practices and the short-term outcomes after antibiotic prescribing..

- Our specific aims are:.
- Cluster analyses of READ codes in patients with incidental use of antibiotics.
- Evaluation of the drivers (patient and practice level) for incidental antibiotic prescribing.
- Longitudinal analysis of variability in rates of change of prescribing between practices and development of a predictive model.
- Survival analysis of short-term outcomes associated with incidental antibiotic prescribing.
- Descriptive analyses of uptake of rapid diagnostics for C-Reactive Protein (CRP)","Professor Tjeerd van Staa - Chief Investigator - University of Manchester

They have complex health care needs and during childhood have their health care coordinated by specialist paediatricians. It is unusual for the child's GP to be actively involved despite these children also having normal childhood illnesses which could be potentially be treated by the GP rather than specialists.  The GP is also in the unique position of being able to offer accessible and timely support to parents and other family members.  However, there is no research published from the UK on the current practices, and the potential role of GPs, in the care of CYP with a LLC. Many of these CYP are often transferred back to the GP to coordinate their care when they are no longer eligible for paediatric services. 
This study will analyse routinely collected healthcare data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and data from hospital admissions to NHS hospitals in England. The analyses will determine the prevalence of children and young people with a LLC in the CPRD dataset and assess whether CYP who have contact with their GP more regularly have reduced numbers of hospital admissions and A&E attendances.","The prevalence of children and young people (CYP) with a Life-Limiting Condition (LLC) is increasing with more than 40,000 CYP currently living with a LLC in England [1, 2]. LLCs are those for which there is no reasonable hope of cure and from which CYP will die.  CYP with a LLC typically have complex health care needs and during childhood their care is coordinated by tertiary or community paediatricians and it is unusual for the child's GP to be actively involved.  However, the care of these individuals is often transferred back to the GP to coordinate their care when they are no longer eligible for paediatric services. Given that many of these children are now living longer, sometimes into adulthood, this is an increasingly common scenario [3].  This study involves quantitative analyses of routinely collected healthcare data including the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and inpatient hospital data to:
1. Determine the prevalence of children with LLC in primary care data. 
2. Describe patterns of GP usage and involvement in children and young people with a LLC in England (0-25 years)
3. To assess the association between the number and regularity of contacts with GP and unplanned hospital admissions/readmissions, A&E attendances and place of death in CYP with a LLC using poisson regression modelling
4. To assess whether there is evidence of increased GP contacts usage or inpatient hospital admissions associated with the transition from paediatric care","The primary health outcome is the number of emergency inpatient hospital episodes.
The secondary health outcomes are 
i) the number of hospital readmissions

All individuals have some decline in their lung function over time, particularly in later life. People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lose lung function faster than the general population, particularly those who continue to smoke. Lower lung function is associated with premature death and may lead to the inability to perform simple physical tasks such as walking short distances unaided. Studies done have shown great variability in lung function decline of COPD patients, but have not yet related this to what other diseases a patient may have, which are called co-morbidities, or to how long they can expect to live. Therefore, in this project we will study whether an integrated model of co-morbidities, lung function decline and time of death can produce more accurate risk scores for COPD patients.","People with COPD have a faster decline in their lung function than people without COPD. However, little is known about how quickly lung function declines in a primary care cohort in an average COPD patient. We are beginning to address this in an already approved clinical epidemiology project (16_186R). In this methodological study we wish to take this work further to study the impact of co-morbidities, testing the ability of landmarking analysis (i.e. dynamic prediction) to model the relationship between co-morbidities and FEV1 decline and their ability to predict mortality in COPD patients. This will be performed using 10-years worth of FEV1 data. In a secondary analysis we will also study latent class analysis can identify COPD patient subtypes with different prognoses. Preliminary work will establish whether co-morbid patients have different FEV1 decline profiles using mixed effect models, using inverse probability weighting to account for selection bias in those with sufficient longitudinal data. Analyses and interpretation will be performed with informative presence in mind, for example we will focus on prediction of mortality (which is well recorded) rather than on causal analyses which would have been biased by missing data and residual confounding.",Death,"Dr Steven Kiddle - Chief Investigator - Astra Zeneca Ltd - UK Headquarters

The development of dementia/AD is a life-long process, where brain disease may start over 20 years before symptoms appear. Current drugs do not cure dementia, or stop it worsening. More focus is needed on preventing dementia in middle age. Recent results from the Finnish FINGER trial show that a prevention programme targeting physical and mental exercise, and a healthy diet, may slow down the development of dementia. The EU-funded MULTI-MODE project aims to help a European partnership develop lifestyle changes based on FINGER trial to prevent dementia. The main aim of this data analysis is check that a score used in the FINGER study to find people likely to get dementia also works in the UK population. The score will be used to test a pilot UK dementia prevention programme using a website and a mobile app. The pilot programme is a linked but separate project, which will use the outputs from this CPRD project, not CPRD data directly. We will also compare the score with a similar score recently developed in the UK, and check that no other improvements can be made to it.","This will be an open retrospective longitudinal cohort study. Data on dementia risk factors (including CVD outcomes) will be analysed.

We will draw upon the TRIPOD guideline and previous CPRD validations, and using Cox regression we will apply the algorithm for each score to eligible patients in the CPRD study cohort to obtain predicted risks for each of the relevant clinical outcomes. We will then test the performance of each score in the CPRD cohort and compare it with the published results from the original validation cohorts using C- and D-statistics and an R2 statistic.

Such drugs have been increasingly linked to a number of serious side effects. However there may be patients where few other alternatives for pain relief exist. Therefore it is essential for both doctors and patients to understand the risk of such drugs compared to one another so that the safest drug is prescribed for patients who may be at the highest risk. This would allow users and their physicians to make informed decisions about the benefits/dangers of such medicines. We will examine how different types and doses of opioid medicines affect a number of potential consequences such as death, heart problems and fractures as part of large international collaboration. Additionally, we will examine if such side effects are more pronounced among patients prescribed specific medications also commonly prescribed with opioids. This work has the potential to benefit a large number of patients, since opioids are prescribed in up to 4% of the adult population. It will help to understand which group of patients are at risk of experiencing serious side-effects/death and eventually improve the quality of prescribing and care for patients with chronic pain.","Opioid use for non-cancer pain has increased significantly over the last 30 years. It has become increasingly apparent that opioids are associated with considerable risks and uncertain benefits. A number of safety outcomes have been associated with opioid use, however little is known about the comparative safety of opioids. Few studies have robustly assessed the effect of opioids on long-term outcomes, the effect of dose, potency, duration, and interactions with other commonly prescribed potentially harmful drugs. A retrospective cohort analysis will be conducted internationally across three countries for all new-users of opioids prescribed for non-malignant pain between 2006-2016, including the UK through CPRD. Descriptive analyses of opioid prescribing trends in each cohort will be followed by modelling of the associations of prescribed opioids with core safety outcomes of (i) all-cause mortality, (ii) cardiovascular outcomes (iii) fractures. Additionally gastrointestinal outcomes and road traffic accidents will be assessed within CPRD. This work will help clinicians and patients understand better the risk profile of opioids to allow informed decision making, based on the resulting insights about potential deleterious effects to patients.

There are an increasing number of studies that suggest that asthma and COPD are not a single disease but a group of diseases that have different causes despite the fact that they share similar symptoms making their diagnoses and treatment challenging. This study will investigate if it is possible to discover these disease subtypes in COPD and asthma using an approach called cluster analysis. This method groups patients (in this instance patients with COPD or asthma) into groups based on individual patient clinical characteristics (such as other diseases and socioeconomic status or demographic information). Patients in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar between them than with patients in other groups. Cluster analysis has been used before for asthma and COPD, but on a much smaller scale, with smaller patient datasets and not covering the spectrum of both diseases in the same analysis. Furthermore, the accuracy of different clustering techniques (e.g. partitional and hierarchical) has not been investigated comprehensively and our research will aim to systematically compare and assess them.","Asthma and COPD are both obstructive airways diseases, and are chronic. Asthma is characterised by recurrent episodes of wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough. COPD, is characterised by airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible, and patients often have symptoms of cough, breathlessness, recurrent infections and wheeze. The expiratory airflow limitation in asthma is reversible, in contrast to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). Asthma and COPD are very heterogeneous diseases, with groups of clinical, pathophysiological and demographic characteristics called phenotypes. Additionally, both disease can overlap (asthma COPD overlap). Currently, there is not much known about the relationship between pathological features, clinical patterns of disease and response to treatment.

In this study, we will use an approach named clustering analysis to try to identify asthma and COPD phenotypes in CPRD. Clustering is an exploratory approach in which can be used to identify subtypes in diseases. Cluster analysis to identify asthma and COPD phenotypes has been used in smaller studies. However, cluster analysis of a larger patient database could lead to the improved identification and characterisation of asthma and COPD phenotypes which would otherwise be grouped into broader disease aggregates.","Clinical phenotypes of asthma and COPD

Consequently, there may be difficulties using the arm or leg in everyday activities including walking, sitting and standing. Impairment of the quality of life will depend on the severity and location of the affected muscles. Spasticity affects over 25% of patients within the first 6 weeks after a stroke. Of approximately 110,000 strokes per year in England around 33,000 result in upper limb and around 27,600 in lower limb spasticity. Physical therapy and drug treatment are essential for avoiding severe spasticity and pain. Drug treatment includes muscle relaxants. Botulinum toxin is a nerve toxin used medically in very low doses to treat certain muscular conditions. It is administered by intramuscular injection into the target muscle and is more effective than muscle relaxants in decreasing pain and increasing mobility. Purpose of the study and the potential importance of the findings: The current study aims to study  patients with stroke-related spasticity who are given botulinum toxin and then to compare their healthcare encounters, lab tests, referrals and medication use before and after treatment.","The study objective is to develop an algorithm to ascertain patients with post-stroke spasticity of the upper or lower limb who are administered Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) and to quantify the healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) in the year before and the year after their first BoNT-A administration. A cohort of patients with post-stroke spasticity treated with BoNT-A will be defined from the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). The HRCU outcomes consist of hospitalisations, days in hospital, hospital procedures, GP visits, and prescriptions for muscle relaxants, anxiolytics and other medications.

The reason for any increased is not understood. We know very little about the impact of cardiovascular disease on shingles and related problems.  
To answer these questions, I will use a very large general population cohort in the UK. I will identify people with herpes zoster and compare them to people who did not develop herpes zoster and look back in their medical records to see if they had any evidence of cardiovascular disease. I will also adjust for other differences between the groups, including treatments, that might account for any increased risk of shingles. 
The analysis will help us to understand whether cardiovascular disease or its treatment (in those with established cardiovascular disease) is associated with an increased shingles risk. This study is directly relevant to the NHS as it will help decide who is at risk of shingles and whether specific groups should be targeted for vaccination.","Three recent exploratory studies have suggested a small but increased risk of herpes zoster (or shingles) associated with cardiovascular disease.

However, NRT works less well in smokers who are pregnant, potentially because during pregnancy biological changes mean that standard doses of NRT are less good at reducing withdrawal symptoms and so pregnant women may be more likely to re-start smoking. A higher dose of NRT might increase the chances of pregnant smokers quitting, which might be achieved by prescribing pregnant women dual NRT (DNRT), a patch to provide a steady background dose of nicotine, plus a fast-acting form such as chewing gum which women can use to top-up their dose to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. Varenicline is another medication that increases the chances of quitting smoking. However, although there is no evidence that it is harmful to a growing foetus, varenicline is not currently licensed for use during pregnancy. It is possible though that some women will inadvertently take varenicline before realising they are pregnant. This study will use GP medical records to investigate how many women in the UK are currently being prescribed DNRT or varenicline during pregnancy, and will investigate how frequently adverse outcomes occur in these women compared to pregnant smokers not prescribed any stop smoking medications.","Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is an effective smoking cessation aid in non-pregnant smokers, but there is evidence of only borderline effectiveness during pregnancy. Low adherence to NRT during pregnancy is the most plausible reason for NRT appearing less effective; nicotine metabolism is much faster in pregnancy and thus NRT is less likely to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms and pregnant smokers are more likely to re-start smoking. Prescribing a higher dose of NRT is a potential way to improve adherence and effectiveness, which might be achieved by use of dual NRT (DNRT),  a patch to provide a steady background dose, plus a fast-acting form such as chewing gum to alleviate withdrawal symptoms as they arise. Varenicline is also an effective smoking cessation therapy when used outside of pregnancy. There is currently no evidence that varenicline is teratogenic, but despite this it is not currently licensed for use during pregnancy. It is possible though that some women will inadvertently take varenicline before realising they are pregnant. This study will investigate how many women in the UK are currently being prescribed DNRT or varenicline during pregnancy, and will investigate how frequently adverse outcomes occur in these women compared to pregnant smokers who are not prescribed any stop smoking medications.","For Study 1 (description of DNRT and varenicline prescribing) and Study 2 (exploration of characteristics of women prescribed DNRT and varenicline) the outcome is prescribing as described above. For Study 3 (comparison of rates of adverse outcomes) the outcome measures which will be assessed are: low birth weight (<2.5kg); preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation); mode of delivery; presence of major congenital abnormality (using the same classifications as in our previous work). We will also present figures for the mean or median (as appropriate) birthweight in kg and gestation in weeks for the different exposure groups. Initially, we will use outcome data as recorded in mothers' and children's primary care records, but for the subset of English practices with linked secondary care HES data we will explore whether outcome data recorded in HES can be used to supplement these.

In the UK, the three commonest skin cancers are cutaneous melanoma (CM), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). CM is less common but requires early recognition and treatment, otherwise 5-year survival rates can be as low as 45%. BCC and SCC are much commoner and seldom cause death, but can lead to disfigurement and recurrence.

We currently rely on cancer registries to estimate how common different cancers are; however, there is under-reporting of skin cancers in such registries, particularly SCC and BCC. A better understanding of the burden of common skin cancers across the UK and in primary care can inform policies and efforts to improve the management of skin cancer, e.g. ensuring enough resources are provided for GPs to care for such patients.

This study will use data from a general practice records database (CPRD) to study how frequently skin cancers are diagnosed, as well as studying whether rates of such cancers are increasing.","This work aims to quantify the burden of skin cancer in UK primary care and to inform system-level policies in skin cancer management.  It aims to use primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to study the epidemiology and primary health care burden of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers in a UK primary care population.

A retrospective cohort analysis will be conducted to estimate the age-adjusted incidence, prevalence, and all-cause mortality of the three commonest skin cancers - cutaneous melanoma (CM), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) - over a ten-year timeframe (2004-2014).","The primary outcome will be: 

Prevalence for the study end year (2014) will be determined by the presence of a skin cancer medcode (as defined by the appendix) in the patient's history. This is consistent with Cancer Research UK's definition of skin cancer prevalence as those who are living with or surviving cancer at a particular point in time24. The denominator will be the mid-year CPRD population in 2014.

Incidence will be defined as a first-ever MM, BCC, or SCC medcode in their file between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2014 amongst patients with an active registration at any point between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2014. Denominators for incidence will be obtained from year-specific CPRD denominator files. To avoid misclassifying a patient as an incident case when they are an ongoing case that has transferred into the CPRD cohort, only patients with at least one year of history in CPRD will be considered.

All-cause mortality will be calculated as the age-standardised mortality rate, using dates of death for patients who have died according to ONS data. All-cause mortality rate is defined as the number of deaths amongst patients with a history of a skin cancer diagnosis medcode.","Dr Fiona Walter - Chief Investigator - University of Cambridge

This study aims to assess clinical and demographic characteristics of patients on cholesterol lowering therapy, including patterns of prescribed medications and variation LDL levels; describe the burden of disease in terms healthcare resource use and incidence of cardiovascular events; and assess predictors of those events. This study will be primarily exploratory and hypothesis generating in nature. Descriptive analysis, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression models will be used. Subgroup analyses will be implemented for known CVD risk factors: subjects with and without familial hypercholesterolemia and with/without chronic kidney disease and diabetes.","Composite cardiovascular event

In addition to established risk factors that differ by sex, such as smoking and obesity, sex hormones may explain part of the excess of cancer in men but little evidence exists. To examine this, we propose to assess hormone therapy, including medications and surgical procedures, commonly used to treat breast and prostate cancers, in relation to risks of subsequent cancers and deaths. Thus, we will study two groups of patients- a breast cancer group and a prostate cancer group- and compare individuals who have used hormone therapies with those that have not used hormone therapies. In an attempt to make sure that differences between the individuals using therapy and those not using therapy can be attributed to the therapy, we will account for various factors such as breast and prostate cancer characteristics, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. This study will help to clarify how hormones are associated with cancer risk in both men and women and provide evidence to weight risks and benefits of hormonal therapies in breast and prostate cancer patients.","Men experience ~50% more cancer incidence and ~70% more cancer-related mortality, compared with women. In addition to established risk factors that differ in prevalence by sex, such as smoking and obesity, sex hormones have been hypothesized to explain part of excessive cancer risks in men but little epidemiological evidence exists. To further understand the influence of hormones on cancer risk, we propose to assess the use of hormone therapy, commonly used to treat breast and prostate cancers, in relation to risks of second cancers and deaths. We propose to construct a female breast cancer cohort and male prostate cancer cohort. The exposure of interest will be anti-estrogens and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), respectively. Hormone therapy includes medication use and surgical procedures after a first primary breast cancer or first primary prostate cancer diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for the associations of hormone therapy in relation to risks of second primary cancer and mortality. Propensity scores will be used to control for potential confounding. The proposed study will substantially add to the literature on our understanding of how sex steroid hormones are associated with risks of second cancer and mortality.","Incident second primary malignant cancer, and disease-specific (e.g., prostate/breast cancer-specific mortality and deaths by organ system), and all-cause mortality using the underlying cause of death in ONS mortality data.","Michael Cook - Chief Investigator - National Cancer Institute ( NCI )

Despite these positive effects, the use of NSAIDs is also associated with an increased risk of heart attacks and bleeding in the gut. Naproxen however seems to be an exception, as studies with many participants could not demonstrate that naproxen increases the chance of heart attacks. 
The favorable profile of naproxen in patients with a previous heart attack is however questioned in patients using aspirin (which is often used to prevent heart attacks) as  laboratory research stipulates that combining naproxen and aspirin might undermine the positive effects of aspirin. In order to answer the question whether naproxen is still favorable in patients using ASA, this study compares the incidence of heart attacks in patients using naproxen with or without ASA.
We decided to answer this question in patients who underwent total hip or knee replacement as these patients often chronically use NSAIDs because of osteoarthritis and have (due to their disease) a higher risk of having heart attack.","The objective is to compare the risk of acute myocardial infarction between different NSAIDs in patients with concomitant aspirin use. Within the CPRD, all adult patients with a primary total hip / knee replacement surgery will be selected. To eliminate distortions from the in hospital period, the first 6 postoperative months will be excluded from the analysis. The exposure of interest is use of different types of NSAID in patients concomitantly taking aspirin. Exposure will be assessed in a time-dependent manner. Adjusted Cox regression models will be used to derive relative risks for the association between NSAID plus aspirin use and the risk of acute myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality.","Our primary outcome of interest will be an AMI. All patients will be followed from the index date until death, transfer out of the practice, THR / TKR revision, the end of data collection, or an AMI.

Obesity is defined as body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, over 30 kg/m2, with the range 25-30 kg/m2 defined as overweight. Metabolically healthy obesity (hereafter abbreviated to MHO) is a medical condition characterized by obesity which does not associate with or produce concomitant medical problems. Through the use of the CPRD database the intention of this study is to study a group of obese patients who are otherwise fit and healthy and follow them up in the community to understand various long term results. This will also be examined after different interventions such as weight loss surgery when compared to those who have not had weight loss surgery but have other medical illnesses related to their obesity such as diabetes or heart disease. The aim of this study is to identify factors that help justify the risk of surgery in the healthy obese when compared to the obese patients with other illnesses already present. The advantage of using CPRD over other databases is that this will evaluate the surgical results compared with the unhealthy obese in the community leading to a greater understanding of characteristics and circumstances to determine if operative risk is justifiable in the healthy obese when compared to the already available literature for unhealthy obese.","In 2014 62% of adults in England were classified as overweight (a body mass index of >25) or obese, compared to 53% 20 years earlier. Our aim is to investigate the impact of management of metabolically healthy obese patients on the NHS compared to non-Healthy Obese. To investigate through retrospective descriptive statistics, the sustainability of being without comorbidities while being morbidly obese through community follow up. This has not been studied before through CPRD and a novel mean of research for benefit of health impact on various demographic and regional distribution of the obesity population. Obesity surgery has been proven beneficial for the metabolically troubled obese, however it has not been proven that this also benefits the healthy obese and hence this will be very beneficial and cost analytical for the impact both of the NHS and worldwide. Read codes for all diagnoses of obesity as well as Medcodes for BMI (Body Mass Index) and comorbidities. Metabolic comorbidities will be determined in primary and secondary databases and, in parallel, relate through HES (length of stay, readmission, in-hospital morbidity and mortality) with CPRD (number of GP consultations, re-referral, resolution of comorbidities). We aim to determine the effect of obesity surgery on this cohort in term of medical outcomes and survival this is as well as resolution of comorbidities and this will be utilised in multilevel and cox regression modelling to determine the effect on survival. This will be in addition to a simple descriptive analysis for the longevity of 'un-healthiness' and survival with and without exposure to obesity surgery. Our study population criteria are - patients over the age of 18 - that have a diagnosis of obesity at any time since initial registration and - (BMI) of or greater than 30. - Patients who are metabolically healthy (ie NO comorbidity)","We would be looking for primary outcomes of mortality and secondary outcomes of coronary heart disease, stroke, cerebrovascular accident, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia as well as depression etc on long term follow up of this cohort.","Mr Paul Ziprin - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

The main objective of these studies is to provide missing important information, such as the use in patients groups not represented in the previous clinical trials or long-term use. 
We proposed first, to investigate utilisation of Selincro and frequency of side effects, in routine clinical practice within 11 European countries by collecting patients' characteristics through their physicians. To complement this approach, European healthcare databases analyses were also proposed to describe drug utilisation patterns. These analyses will be conducted in 3 European countries including the UK, in which, the analysis of routinely collected health information will be done using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD GOLD).

However, individuals with certain social characteristics (for example, those living in more deprived areas, or those living alone) maybe less likely to receive vaccination. Some of these individuals could also be at higher risk of the disease the vaccine prevents, making them doubly disadvantaged. At present in England, information about social factors that affect vaccination and risk of vaccine-preventable disease is lacking. This makes it difficult to plan interventions to address these disadvantages. 

This study will examine the social factors that may be linked with higher shingles disease burden, and with decreased uptake of shingles vaccine. The frequency of developing shingles, and of receiving the shingles vaccine, will be compared among older individuals with different social circumstances.  We will also look at factors linked with lower uptake of childhood influenza vaccine by comparing the frequency of uptake of influenza vaccine among children with different social circumstances.  Identifying social factors that are associated with lower vaccination rates and (for shingles) higher burden of disease will help to design programmes to improve vaccine uptake in specific groups of individuals at higher risk.","Addressing inequalities in vaccine uptake to prevent infections in children and in adults is a key priority for public health. In England, current surveillance methods provide little information about social factors associated with the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases or vaccine uptake. These social factors may vary for older individuals and children. 

This project will use linked electronic health records and a cohort study design to investigate the association between selected social factors and uptake of two vaccines introduced in England in 2013; zoster vaccine in older individuals and intranasal influenza vaccine in young children. Similarly, the association between social factors and incidence of zoster in older individuals will be investigated, to assess whether some individuals are doubly disadvantaged (less likely to receive zoster vaccine and more likely to develop zoster). A hierarchical modelling approach will be used to investigate the effects of upstream and downstream social determinants of vaccine uptake and burden.  The results of this project will enhance existing surveillance methods and should help to address vaccine-related health inequities.","An incident zoster diagnosis

Some of the most commonly used of these medications are proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). In recent years, PPIs have been linked with hypomagnesemia, a disturbance in which the blood magnesium level is abnormally low. Both the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Federal Drug Agency (FDA) have issued drug safety warnings regarding potential relationship between long-term PPI use and hypomagnesemia. Most of the evidence for the relationship between long-term PPI use and hypomagnesemia was gathered from case reports and hospital based studies. In addition, there have been several case reports that have associated the use of PPI with mineral disturbances in the blood that include low blood sodium (hyponatremia), low blood potassium (hypokalaemia), and low blood calcium (hypocalcaemia). In light of the increasing use of PPIs in the general population and the negative consequences of hypomagnesemia and the other mineral abnormalities, it is important to assess the extent to which the use of long-term PPI therapy increases the risk of a patient developing these disturbances in routine clinical practices.","We will conduct a population-based cohort study to examine the association between long-term PPI use and risk of hypomagnesemia in the general population. We will extract all patients within CPRD who had been continually prescribed a PPI over a period of 12 months between 1990 and 2013. These exposed patients will be matched to non-PPI users in term of age, gender, and general practice.

A few studies have raised concerns that tiotropium and ipratropium bromide, two drugs similar to aclidinium, may have adverse effects on the heart. Heart disease and death are described as potential risks for aclidinium. The objective of this research is to evaluate, through a series of studies, the potential for heart disease and death with aclidinium use. The first of these studies is on the risk of death. In this study we will calculate and compare the risk of death among users of aclidinium and users of other medications to treat chronic lung disease.","This nested case-control study aims to evaluate the risk of all-cause mortality in patients initiating aclidinium bromide and other study medications as compared to LABA and in patients initiating aclidinium bromide as compared to patients initiating other COPD medications. The study will also evaluate the effect of duration of use on the risk of death. The case-control is nested in a cohort of patients aged 40 years or under, with COPD initiating aclidinium bromide or other COPD medications in the CPRD in the UK between 2012 and 2016. All confirmed cases of death will be included in the nested case-control study. Density sampling will be used to select four controls for each case.

However, as the condition progresses, additional medications (i.e., on top of metformin) may be used. The type of additional medication used depends on a number of factors including (but not limited to) their effects on patients' kidney function - a key complication associated with diabetes progression. One such class of medications called dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been thought to improve kidney function among people with diabetes. By comparison another commonly used class of medications called the sulfonylureas (SU) do not appear to have such benefits. However, we are aware of only one clinical trial and one real world study that compared the effects of these two classes of medications on outcomes related to kidney functioning directly. These studies had very few patients using a particular type of medication from each class and the outcomes were compared over short periods of time. Our study expands on this prior research by comparing the kidney-related outcomes of all diabetes patients treated with DPP-4 inhibitors to those treated with SU (both in combination with metformin) in the United Kingdom (UK) after 2007.","The proposed study will assess the comparative effectiveness of using DPP-4 inhibitors vs. SU in addition to metformin in 2007-2014 in terms of incidence of renal outcomes (albuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate) among T2DM patients with more than 3 months of metformin alone in the UK. In addition, the study aims to describe the characteristics of patients receiving DPP-4 inhibitors vs. SU after more than 3 months of metformin therapy, with the earliest indications of simultaneous use of background metformin and either DPP-4 inhibitor or SU considered as the index date. Baseline covariates will be descriptively compared between the two cohorts using chi-squared tests for proportions and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous measures. Outcomes will be assessed during at least 12 months after the index date. Time to first occurrence of the outcomes of interest will be described using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and log-rank p-values. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models will be used to assess the differences in incidence rates adjusting for baseline differences in demographics (e.g., age, gender), clinical attributes (e.g., renal function, glycemic burden), comorbidities, and other medication use. Sensitivity analyses will estimate K-M curves and Cox models for propensity-score matched cohorts with similar baseline characteristics.","Primary outcome:

Beyond lifestyle changes, hypertensive patients are usually prescribed drugs to lower their blood pressure and thus prevent these cardiovascular disorders. Several classes of antihypertensive drugs are used to treat hypertension. While current clinical practice recommends starting therapy with a single drug, it is often necessary to increase its dose and/or to combine several drugs to lower the blood pressure enough.
This study aims to find out whether hypertensive patients who start therapy with two drugs in combination achieve faster blood pressure control and have a lower risk of heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death when compared with patients started with a single drug. As the choice of the first therapy will be related to patient profile and medical history, patients from both treatment groups will be matched.
The study will also examine if the findings are similar for patients with mild hypertension and patients started with two of the most commonly used antihypertensive drug classes. This may provide new evidence on the clinical effectiveness of a more intensive initial treatment strategy in hypertension.","The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of initiating therapy with two drugs in combination versus monotherapy as the initial drug treatment strategy in hypertension.
Adults with hypertension and initiating antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, calcium-channel blockers, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics and beta-blockers, between 2006 and 2014 will be identified and followed until 2015. Patients initiating two drugs in combination (given as fixed or free combination) will be matched (1:4) to those initiated on a single drug using a propensity score built on key baseline characteristics to control for channelling bias.
The primary outcome will be time to blood pressure control while secondary outcomes will include a composite endpoint (acute non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death) and time to treatment response. Incidence rates will be estimated in each cohort. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios and assess the potential association between initial therapy strategy and these outcomes.
Analyses will be replicated for patients with grade 1 hypertension and for patients initiating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or calcium-channel blockers. This large population-based study should identify any potential benefits associated with an initially more intensive hypertension treatment strategy.","Primary outcome.

We have collected information on factors such as smoking and obesity through postal questionnaires, and on deaths, cancers and hospital admissions through linkage to NHS databases. We use this information to study risk factors for diseases such as cancer and stroke. However, we have limited information on drug prescribing, and on diseases managed in outpatient and primary care settings. General practice records are the most comprehensive source of such information, as GPs hold the full health record for NHS patients.

For this proposal, we plan to use linked CPRD records for over 102,000 women in our study to help our investigations of fractures, arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome (a common condition affecting nerves in the wrist and hand). We will compare the CPRD information with that already held by MWS and use it to improve our understanding of how factors such as obesity and physical exercise affect the risk of these conditions.

Women in the Million Women Study gave written consent to follow-up through medical records. We have extensive experience of using CPRD data, and the proposed study is approved by our NHS ethics committee.","In order to inform risk factor analyses within the Million Women Study cohort, we wish to continue using the linked CPRD-Million Women Study dataset provided to us in 2014 under Protocol 12-070R3. 

The aim is to use information on primary care and outpatient activity in CPRD to supplement available study data (self-reported, medical records, and linked coded hospital admissions, death and cancer follow-up data provided to us through HSCIC). Using basic tabulation and description of data for comparisons, we will assess the reliability and completeness of coded NHS data (such as HES) for diagnostic outcomes, and of self-reported prescribing data for exposures. This new proposal deals with musculoskeletal outcomes (fracture, arthritis, joint replacement, carpal tunnel syndrome). 

Large UK cohorts benefit from the availability of long term, cost effective, unbiased follow-up through linkage to NHS records: it is important to assess the reliability of such records for large-scale epidemiology, and to make the results available to others.

Recent evidence suggests that individuals with diabetes may be at risk of developing several types of cancers including bowel and bladder cancer. Furthermore, evidence suggests metformin, a first line therapy for type 2 diabetes, may reduce the risk of several cancers, including breast cancer. However for other types of cancer evidence is limited and inconclusive, including for a group of cancers whose development is triggered by certain viruses. These cancers account for approximately 10% of all cancers worldwide and include for example cancer of the liver and cervix. This study will investigate if the use of metformin is associated with a decrease in risk of virus-induced cancers in patients with type 2 diabetes using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.","Recently, there has been an interest in the anti-tumor effects of metformin, a biguanide used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Preclinical studies suggest metformin may have anti-tumor effects on viral induced cancers yet limited observational studies to date have investigated this. This study aims to investigate if metformin is associated with a decreased risk of vial induced cancers. From a cohort of patients newly-prescribed non-insulin antidiabetic medications between January 1 1988 and March 31 2015, all patients with type 2 diabetes (with no prior history of cancer) will be identified. All patients will be followed-up until a first diagnosis of viral-induced cancer or censored upon hysterectomy (with a 3 month window to allow the inclusion of any cervical cancer diagnoses determined at hysterectomy), a death (from any cause), end of registration with the GP or end of the study period (March 31 2016).

1616632661-1987,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=36,Trends in the prescription of oral anticoagulants in UK primary care (2009-2015),"Oral anticoagulants (OAC) are medications that are used to reduce the formation of blood clots. As such, they are often prescribed to prevent strokes (blood clots in the brain) in patients with irregular heart rhythms. They are also used to prevent or treat blood clots occurring in veins throughout the body. The most commonly used OAC are vitamin K antagonists (VKA) such as warfarin. Although effective at reducing the risk of clotting, VKA are impractical to use, and may be associated with significant bleeding complications. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) such as dabigatran were introduced in the UK in 2008 as potentially useful alternatives to VKA. Indeed, clinical trials have shown that while they work as well as warfarin in reducing blood clots, NOAC cause fewer side effects and are also easier to use. Little is known about how NOAC have been received in regular clinical practice in the UK, and whether the introduction of NOAC has affected the way OAC are prescribed in UK primary care. The objective of this study is to therefore address these uncertainties, by examining temporal patterns in the prescription of OAC and in the profile of patients who are treated with these medications.","A longitudinal cohort study will be used to analyze trends in OAC prescription rates and patient profiles in the UK, from 2009 to 2015. Incident prescription rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals of OAC (VKA, NOAC, and individual NOAC) for each calendar year will be estimated using Poisson distribution. Prescription rates will be stratified by age, sex, and indication (where available). We will also estimate the proportion of prescriptions attributable to each OAC in each calendar year, and changes in proportions for VKA and NOAC will be analyzed over time using a chi-squared test for trend. The profile of incident users will be described for each OAC and each calendar year of study, including demographic characteristics, risk factors, comorbidities, medications, and a measure of health utilization. Baseline profiles will be stratified by indication, and analyzed over time and between OAC using one-way ANOVA for means and chi-squared test for proportions. Multivariate logistic regression will be used to model the probability of a NOAC prescription as compared to VKA. The profile of users who switch anticoagulants over the course of the study period will also be analyzed, and stratified by the direction of the switch and by calendar year.","All OAC in the British National Formulary (BNF) and that are available in the UK for the prevention of VTE and/or the prevention of stroke in NVAF patients will be identified. Warfarin, phenindione, and acenocoumarol are VKA that fall under the coumarins and phenindione category of the BNF. All VKA (warfarin, acenocoumarin, and phenindione) will be grouped and analyzed as a single OAC class. NOAC to be studied include dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, as well as rivaroxaban and apixaban which are Factor Xa inhibitors. These NOAC will be analyzed both individually, and together as a single OAC class. Patient demographics including age and sex, as well as risk factors, comorbidities, medications and combined risk factor scores will be used to describe the average patient profile at the time of first prescription, for every year of study and for each OAC class (VKA and NOAC) and individual NOAC (i.e. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban). The number of physician visits will also be included as a measure of health utilization. Comorbidities and vascular risk factors to be identified include obesity, smoking status, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, liver disease, history of bleeding, venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism. Concomitant medications will include antiplatelets, NSAIDs, lipid lowering agents, and antihypertensive drugs (beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors).

These salts are part of a standard panel of blood tests performed during medical assessment by doctors. Very high or very low levels of these salts in the blood are indicators of serious disease and require immediate treatment. However, there is evidence that minor changes in the blood levels of these salts (i.e. within the range considered normal) are markers of cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and stroke. Thus if these tests can be used to identify those individuals at high risk of developing heart attack or stroke in the future, then this can be used for starting early preventive measures without performing additional expensive tests. Moreover, conducting a detailed study of these salts will enable us to have a deeper understanding of the possible mechanisms that is indicated by these tests and will help us discover new treatments. To do this, we propose to examine the relationship between these blood tests and the risk of developing or dying from a range of cardiovascular diseases in health records from primary and hospital care.","The electrolytes in serum and urine (sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), bicarbonate, (HCO3), chloride (Cl-) and calcium (Ca2+) as well as the important renal biomarkers (urea, creatinine, phosphate, urate and microalbumin) play an integral role in intermediary metabolism and cellular function. Imbalances in the intra- and extracellular concentrations of each electrolyte are associated with adverse metabolic and physiological consequences. Under normal conditions homeostasis is maintained between intake, intra/extracellular shifts and excretion. In most cases depletion or repletion of electrolytes occur in tandem, requiring consideration of related cation/anion biomarker species (e.g. Na+ and K+). Electrolyte anomalies are commonly described in hospitalized patients and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There are few studies however examining electrolyte anomalies in non-acute populations such as the ones encountered in primary care. The objective of this study is to examine separately, for independence, the relationship between the first recorded measurement of each biomarker and the incidence of various diagnosed CVD events and cause-specific mortality. For this longitudinal cohort of men and women aged 18 and older, we will employ risk prediction models, clustered by practice to determine the associations. Models will be validated for their discrimination, calibration and overall fit using a panel of sensitivity analyses.","We will examine the association between electrolytes and the following CVD outcomes:

We will examine how the numbers and types of medicines prescribed by GPs change before and after an admission to hospital in 100,000 adults who were hospitalised in 2014. We will find out what factors might affect any change in medicine use, including the reason for hospital admission, the urgency of the hospital admission, and length of stay in hospital. We will also take into account factors such as the age, sex and long-term health problems of the patient.

This work will help to identify patients who are most likely to experience changes in their medicines after a hospital admission, and what types of medicines are most likely to be affected.

If HIV-positive people are treated early and well then they have a near normal life expectancy and are less likely to infect others with their HIV accidently. However, a quarter of people infected with HIV do not know that they carry the virus. Although you could test (screen) everyone for HIV, this would not be cost effective. We want to better target testing to people who are most likely to have HIV. Patients with HIV often see their GP with other illnesses which can be due to HIV before their HIV is detected as the cause. In this study, we aim to develop a computer program to alert the practice that an individual should be offered an HIV test by their GP when the patients visits the surgery. To do this we need to know what symptoms people with HIV go to their GP with.

We will undertake a feasibility study using retrospective data: 
i) Using CPRD data we will determine HIV testing rates in the GP setting by calendar year, sex and age.
ii) We will  investigate which risk factors are predictive for HIV and the clinical symptoms they experienced prior to or at diagnosis of HIV. We will fit candidate predictive models based on these factors to discriminate between HIV-positive and negative individuals. 
iii) We will evaluate the specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive value of candidate models based on different configurations of risk factor information. 
iv) The discrimination of the model with optimum performance characteristics will be further assessed in a retrospective analysis of GP data in two local practices and refined if sensitivity and specificity suggests this is needed.","The outcome for determining testing rates in primary care is whether a person has undergone an HIV test.The outcome for research on the HIV risk algorithm is HIV positive, denoted either by a positive HIV test result or recorded that HIV positive/AIDS recorded in CPRD, or died with HIV mentioned on the death certificate as recorded by ONS death registry.","Professor John Macleod - Chief Investigator - University of Bristol

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease where fat accumulates in the liver of individuals who drink very little alcohol. NAFLD has also been increasing in recent years and can potentially progress to liver cancer. Notably, in almost all areas worldwide, liver cancer and NAFLD rates are higher in men than women. While this may be partially explained by higher rates of known risk factors among men, such as viral infections or excessive alcohol consumption, these factors do not fully explain the sex differences.  One possibility is that hormones could be related to the sex differences.  
 	In animal models, oestrogen administration/removal of testicles reduces liver cancer development in male rodents, while testosterone administration/removal of ovaries increases liver cancer development in female rodents.  In human studies, an increased risk of liver cancer and NAFLD was seen among women who had surgical removal of their ovaries.  However, these previous population studies were based on small numbers or self-report. Thus, we propose to conduct a study of liver cancer and NAFLD in relation to ovary removal. This investigation could provide further knowledge about the benefits and harms of oophorectomy and hormone use in women.","We aim to conduct two case-control studies to assess the association between oophorectomy and the subsequent development of liver cancer or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among individuals in the CPRD.  We also propose to include alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALFD) as a comparator group for NAFLD, as the aetiologies underlying these two types of liver disease differ.  We will identify all eligible primary liver cancer and fatty liver disease cases in this population, and controls will be matched to cases at a 4:1 ratio on age, sex, general practice, and length of time in the CPRD.  Oophorectomy will be classified as ever oophorectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.  We will additionally classify oophorectomy by duration of time between oophorectomy and outcome.

We will fit statistical models to look at how BMI is associated with each of a wide range of causes of death, taking into account information on other factors like smoking that could be linked to both BMI and the risk of dying from particular diseases. We will look at whether the role of BMI is different for different subgroups of the population. Finally, within groups of people with similar BMI levels, we will estimate the proportion dying from different causes at specific ages.","Body mass index (BMI) is associated with all-cause mortality, but few large studies have explored associations with death from specific causes.

However, it is not clear how GPs should investigate unexpected weight loss. Without clarification, GPs may wait too long before referring (choosing to watch and wait and potentially missing a diagnosis) or not long enough (overburdening hospital services and exposing patients to the risks of investigation). 

This study involves an analysis of patients with unexpected weight loss to examine the extent to which weight loss indicates cancer or another serious disease in patients visiting to their GP. As weight is not routinely measured by GPs in the UK, we will first describe why and when GPs measure and record weight in their patient's electronic record. Secondly, patients will be entered into a cohort analysis - patients with and without weight loss codes in their electronic record will be followed up in the database to examine the number that turn out to have cancer or another serious disease within 24 months of reporting the weight loss.","The overall aim is to provide the evidence necessary to allow GPs to more effectively manage patients with unexplained weight loss.

Research questions
Review of the existing evidence exposes key evidence gaps where questions remain unanswered:

1)	How often and when is weight measured, and the symptom of unexpected weight loss coded, in NHS primary care?

2)	What is the diagnostic predictive value of recorded weight loss, volunteered or elicited as a symptom, for cancer and serious disease in primary care?
 
Methods
A cohort analysis of UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data to: 1) Describe how often the symptom of reported weight loss is recorded, and when weight is measured in NHS primary care; 2) Identify the predictive value of recorded weight loss for cancer and serious disease in primary care. The cohort analysis will compare the incidence of cancer over time in those with and without weight loss, using Cox regression to explore and adjust for covariates as appropriate. Preliminary work in CPRD estimates that weight loss as a symptom is recorded for about 52,500 patients >40 years, providing adequate statistical power and precision in relation to cancer overall and common cancers individually.","Outcome 1 - Objective weight measurement.

A non-interventional study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a collection of lung diseases that narrow the airways, causing breathing difficulties and other symptoms such as persistent cough or chest infections. People with COPD often receive treatment in the form of inhalers, and different types of inhaler are available. This study aims to compare steroid inhalers, also called corticosteroid inhalers which work by reducing the inflammation in the airways, with other types of inhaler used in COPD to see whether these affect the number of times a person with COPD will need to visit their GP or the hospital. This is important as we need to know whether these treatments help improve the lives of people with COPD.","This study is a non-interventional cohort study using existing data provided by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), to gain detailed insights on the characteristics of COPD patients treated with an Inhaled Corticosteroid (ICS) containing therapy or non-ICS containing therapy. Recent research suggests that many patients appear to be inappropriately prescribed ICS at their initial COPD diagnosis, regardless of lung function severity. The potential effect that this may have on outcomes after diagnosis has yet to be investigated. The main objective of this study is to compare health care resource use between patients prescribed an ICS and non-ICS containing therapy after COPD diagnosis. The results from this study will be used to support the scientific understanding of how choice of therapy may influence COPD outcomes. Comorbidities and demographic information will be described for the groups of patients initiated on different therapies.

It is a long-lasting condition and, in severe cases, can cause permanent damage to the oesophagus.
Symptoms include heartburn, indigestion and acid reflux (stomach acid rising in the throat) and these can impact on patients' quality of life. The symptoms can be relieved using medication prescribed by the doctor or bought by the patients themselves over the counter. Drugs called proton-pump inhibitors, which reduce the production of stomach acid, are usually tried first. Other treatments for GORD include alginates, which work by forming a protective barrier on top of the stomach contents, preventing these from being regurgitated. 
In this study we wish to use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to identify patients with GORD and describe how it is treated and how it affects patients' health. We will select patients with a first diagnosis of GORD in 2009, allowing their records to be followed for up to five years.","We aim to describe the epidemiology of patients diagnosed with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), selecting patients who have a first diagnosis of GORD in 2009, have been registered for at least five years at an up-to-standard practice at the date of diagnosis, and are eligible for HES linkage.  We will look at incident exposures of these patients and examine the distribution of age and sex.  The rate of hospital admissions per 1000 patient years will also be calculated.
Patterns of treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and prescribed alginates in patients diagnosed with GORD will also be described. Treatment paths will be observed for patients from their first prescription for an alginate or a PPI, or for a combination of PPI plus alginate, where these share a first prescription date. In addition, analyses will be performed on the switching patterns between two alginate product groups: commonly used, branded alginates and other alginate-containing products. Time to first switch will be compared between alginate groups using a Cox proportional hazards model.","Patient and clinical characteristics at first GORD diagnosis Rates of hospital admission for GORD

This common condition has a significant impact on a woman's well-being. While treatments (lifestyle changes and drugs) are offered in primary care, surgical care can be recommended if symptoms persist. There are concerns about the availability and quality of care for women with UI, especially surgical treatment. Information is lacking on: whether the rate of surgical procedures is appropriate or uniform across hospitals; whether access differs by age, ethnicity and socio-economic background; the factors that impact on women's treatment preferences; and how doctors decide whether to recommend surgery.

Purpose: To improve the delivery of surgical services for women with UI by: assessing the accuracy and completeness of data on UI in national primary and secondary care datasets; investigating the variation in care and surgical treatments across England; and exploring factors that determine whether patients are referred to secondary care and/or have surgery. 

Potential Importance: The results will enable commissioners, managers and policy makers to improve care for women with UI.","Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) affects one in three adult women, but fewer than 20% of them are actively treated, despite UI's wide-ranging impact on employment, social activities and personal relationships. Rates of surgery for UI have increased over the last decade, mostly due to new procedures, but there is evidence of inequity in access and service provision, with concerns of under-provision in vulnerable populations.

Aim: To improve the delivery of surgical care for women with UI. 

Objectives: To assess the consistency, completeness and accuracy of data on UI in routine datasets. To examine variations in care, referral patterns and determinants of both.

Methods and Data Analysis: We will develop coding frameworks for UI and relevant treatments by assessing consistency, completeness and accuracy of diagnostic and treatment/procedure codes used in inpatient and outpatient Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) and Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Referral patterns and determinants of referral and surgery will be examined using a linked primary care (CPRD) and secondary care dataset (HES) and multiple regression models. Potential determinants include age, BMI, ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation and patterns of prior care.","Treatments given in primary care

Statins are some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the UK but there are many reported side effects. These include muscle aches/weakness, joint pain, blurred vision, memory problems, feeling sick, and an increased risk of getting diabetes. The best type of study to examine the effects of statins are randomised controlled trials (RCTs): patients are given either statins or a placebo (a dummy drug having no effect) but they do not know which one they are taking. A number of RCTs and observational studies have been performed to date but the evidence around the safety of statins is conflicting. It is not always clear that it is the statins themselves causing the side effects from the observational studies, while the patients who take part in RCTs are not always representative of the rest of the population who are prescribed statins. New studies can be very expensive and time consuming and so we will use a statistical method called regression discontinuity analysis (RDA) using existing data which provides stronger evidence for a real relationship when a new RCT is not possible.","The evidence surrounding the safety of statins is conflicting despite a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We will use a regression discontinuity analysis (RDA) to assess the effects of statins on both intended and unintended consequences. RDA is a statistical technique that allows for causal inference when a decision rule (such as being above or below a cut-off value on a continuous measure) is used to assign treatment. It is a quasi-experimental method that (like RCTs) reduces the effect of confounding of unobserved variables. The assumption being that patients lying just either side of the cut-off value are similar, in terms of observed and unobserved characteristics. Focussing on a small window surrounding the cut-off value should result in treatment assignment being the only difference between patients. We will therefore look at patient QRISK2 score as the exposure and our outcomes will include cardiovascular disease, future cholesterol levels and future QRISK2 scores (to determine efficacy of statins) and commonly reported side effects such as muscle pain and weakness, nausea and diabetes development (to determine safety). RDA is a novel method in clinical and epidemiological studies and it will provide insights into the causal effects of statins on side effects and also their efficacy.",#NAME?,"Professor Kate Tilling - Chief Investigator - University of Bristol

These babies, and those weighing less than 1500g at birth, are at risk of long-term lung damage. This is called chronic lung disease and can cause problems such as asthma and severe lung disease in adulthood. Advances in technology have led to improvements in care for these infants, and therefore many more are now surviving. This has increased the number of cases of chronic lung disease seen in childhood and adulthood, and changed the nature and severity of the illness. There has been little research looking at the additional healthcare requirements (e.g. hospitalisation, GP visits) these children have and whether these have changed over time. It is important to understand these additional healthcare requirements in a recent group of ex-preterm infants as this will help us counsel parents about long-term problems as well as help care for these children. We aim to study this using a large database of healthcare records from GP and hospital care, and see if there are differences between children severely affected compared to those mildly affected and compared to children of normal birth weight who were not premature.","In recent decades advances in neonatal intensive care, such as the introduction of antenatal corticosteroid treatment, surfactant administration and improved respiratory support, have led to improvements in the survival of very premature and low birth weight infants. However, chronic lung disease (CLD) remains a major complication of prematurity and low birth weight, and is associated with many short, medium and long-term morbidities, and increased mortality. Despite the growing number of premature and very low birth weight (VLBW) babies surviving into childhood, there are relatively few recent, nationally-representative studies of health outcomes and use of healthcare resources in this group. Using data collected from CPRD and HES, we propose to use repeated cross-sectional analyses to study the prevalence of VLBW and preterm infants discharged on home oxygen and a retrospective cohort study to identify the medium and long-term morbidities (measures of respiratory health, measures of growth) and healthcare resources used (primary and secondary care consultations, inpatient stays, prescriptions) by this cohort in comparison to preterm and VLBW infants without home oxygen and term infants with normal birthweights. This information will provide an understanding of mechanisms, evolution, and consequences of lung disease in these preterm infants, and is essential in developing prevention strategies as well as in the management of these infants in the neonatal period and beyond.","Part 1.

Hypertension during pregnancy can progress to pre-eclampsia, a severe onset of high blood pressure which can affect multiple organ systems and cause seizures. Changes in the management of pre-eclampsia, such as more aggressive treatment and protocols to restrict fluids administered into the veins, are considered to have improved important aspects of maternal and newborn health. However, their impact on the occurrence of a rare but serious adverse outcome such as acute renal failure (a rapid deterioration of kidney function) has not been adequately studied. Increases in acute renal failure have been reported, with a dramatic increase in Canada among women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The aim of our study is to determine whether potential changes in pre-eclampsia management increased acute renal failure while improving other aspects of maternal and newborn health. We will analyze data from family doctor visits and hospital based medical records. Findings from this research will help health care providers and patients understand the risks and benefits of treating hypertension in pregnancy and to make the informed decisions about treatment options, potentially helping to improve the health of women and newborns.","The primary objective of this study is to determine whether obstetric acute renal failure rates rose in the United Kingdom following a series of confidential enquiries into maternal deaths reports recommending improvements in pre-eclampsia treatment. A secondary objective is to determine whether these recommendations achieved their objective of reducing the rates of pulmonary oedema and improving other maternal and infant health outcomes among women with pre-eclampsia and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. To achieve these objectives, we will conduct an interrupted time series study of pregnant women using retrospective data between April 1, 1998 and March 31, 2015. We hypothesize that following the confidential enquiry reports, pre-eclampsia treatment intensity increased, pulmonary oedema and other maternal and perinatal complications decreased among women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and rates of acute renal failure increased.","The primary outcome will be the occurrence of acute renal failure, defined are occurring during the delivery episode or within 42 days of delivery within ICD-10 codes or Read codes.

This study aims to estimate how much treatment of eczema in children costs the English NHS.  We will select children with and without eczema ensuring the two groups are comparable in terms of age, sex and from the same General Practice.   Other diseases linked to eczema including asthma and hay fever will also be considered.  Information from two sources called Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CRPD) and linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) will identify the total use of resources and their costs for patients treated in the community and in hospital.  The use of resources and costs will be shown according the patients age, other illnesses, and years since the eczema was first diagnosed. Understanding the current cost of eczema to the NHS will help with planning services and prioritising future research.","This study will estimate the total annual NHS resource use and costs for children with eczema. This work builds upon the work undertaken as part of ISAC Protocol 16_056 (entitled ""Risk of eczema in children: a population-based study""). From HES-linked CPRD, children aged 0-17 years with an incidence of eczema by the end of March 2015 will be identified as cases, and will be 1:1 individually matched to controls based on age, gender, and General practice. All NHS primary and secondary care resource use during April 2014 to March 2015 will be extracted for cases and controls.  Resource use will be costed using published unit costs for 2015 in £sterling. Descriptive statistics will describe children's characteristics, resource use and costs. Multivariate regression models for paired data will be used to examine the mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) in healthcare costs between cases and controls with adjustment for potential confounders including comorbidities. The results will also be stratified by years since diagnosis, age, and comorbidities.",NHS primary and secondary care resource use and cost during April 2014 to March 2015,"Dr Tracey Sach - Chief Investigator - University of East Anglia

1616632603-1965,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=37,The role of statins in the survival of total arthroplasty of the hip and knee.,"For many patients with lower limb osteoarthritis, the most effective treatment is total hip/knee replacement. However, around 2% of all patients who undergo a hip/knee replacement need revision surgery within 3 years. Revision surgery is associated with poorer clinical outcomes compared to primary surgery. It is therefore important to identify factors which may reduce the need for revision surgery. Statins are medications that are used to lower the levels of fat in the blood and are commonly used to reduce the risk of heart disease. Recently, statins have been found to reduce inflammation and encourage bone rebuilding;  for these reasons there has been interest into whether statins may improve the length of joint survival time after hip and knee replacements. Using data from a large prescription database in Denmark, researchers have identified a potential role for statins in helping to reduce the risk of requiring revision surgery. Recently, a study of a large cohort of patients from the UK also found that statin use was associated with a small decreased risk of revision surgery. However, the authors did not consider the timing of statin exposure relative to the hip/knee replacement surgery, which may be important because of biological processes which take place in the early phase following surgery, or the type of fixation used (whether cemented or not). The aim of our study is to determine whether the timing of statin therapy relative to hip/knee replacement surgery and also the type of implant influences the risk of revision surgery in a UK population.","Research suggests that statin exposure may reduce the risk of revision surgery in patients who have undergone THA/TKA by reducing periprosthetic osteolysis through inhibiting osteoclast formation and reducing inflammation around the joint, through attenuating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using data from a large prescription database in Denmark in a nested case control study design, researchers found that statin therapy was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of revision arthroplasty among those who had a hip replacement. More recently, a study using data from CPRD confirmed that statin use was associated with a small decreased risk of revision surgery. However, in neither study did the authors consider the timing of statin exposure relative to the hip/knee replacement surgery, which may be important in determining outcome because statins are thought to influence osseointegration, which occurs early in the postoperative phase (usually in the three months following arthroplasty), and also osteolysis, which occurs much later (>5 years after primary surgery). They did not look also at whether the type of implant (cemented / uncemented) influenced outcome; this is potentially important as the mechanism of fixation in the femur occurs through different mechanisms in cemented and uncemented prostheses. The proposed study aims to look at whether statin exposure during key postoperative periods influences the risk of revision surgery and also whether there is any influence of the type of implant (cemented / uncemented) on outcome. Inclusion/exclusion criteria: patients with a code for primary THA or TKA recorded in CPRD from 1997 to the date of data extraction will be included in the study. Patients who are aged <40 years, have a history of hip fracture, or have a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis, at the time of the primary surgery will be excluded. Exposure: Any statin prescriptions. Exposure specifically in the following periods: 3 months before primary surgery to 12 months after primary surgery, 12 months to 5 years after primary surgery, and >5 years following surgery. Outcome: Revision of THA/TKA, identified from primary care records. Statistical analysis: Logistic regression and Cox regression will be used to determine the hazard ratio of revision in the exposed compared to unexposed. In the time-to revision Cox model, the index date will be the date of primary THA/TKA. Participants will be censored at the time of revision surgery, death, date at which their GP practice stops contributing data to CPRD, or the end of the study period (date of data extraction). Propensity score matching will be used to address potential confounding by indication.",The outcome is revision of primary THA/TKA.

There are over 800,000 people in the UK diagnosed with dementia and this number is increasing as people live longer. There are some medicines which are recommended for use in treating the symptoms of dementia. However, there are others, some of which are not recommended for use in patients with dementia as they can sometimes lead to heart attacks, strokes, and death, which are also used to manage dementia symptoms despite being intended for use in other conditions. The over prescribing of these medicines not recommended for use in patients with dementia has been identified and efforts are ongoing to try and ensure patients are diagnosed with dementia in a timely fashion and are prescribed the appropriate medications to treat their symptoms. This study will explore the number of diagnoses of dementia across the UK and the level of use of different medicines to treat the symptoms. The findings will help inform ongoing national efforts to reduce inappropriate prescribing.","Dementia is a syndrome that is associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. Symptoms can include memory loss, language problems, short attention span, misunderstanding, and lack of judgement. There are over 800,000 people in the UK diagnosed with dementia, with this number, and hence the associated cost, expected to increase dramatically as life expectancy increases. Anti-dementia drugs are licensed for the treatment of the symptoms of dementia with an increasing number of cheaper generic formulations becoming available in recent years. In addition, antipsychotic drugs have been used to manage the psychological and behavioural symptoms of dementia in elderly patients although only one, risperidone, is licensed for the treatment of dementia patients. Other antipsychotics are not usually recommended for the treatment of dementia because they are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, and can make the symptoms of dementia worse. This study will quantify the level of recorded diagnosis of dementia and the prescribing of both anti-dementia and antipsychotic medications over time. It will also investigate the potential impact of both new guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of dementia as well as decreasing medication costs. Trends in the use of other medicines that are also used to treat the symptoms of dementia, including antidepressants, hypnotics/anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants, will also be explored. This is a descriptive study only and no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. The findings will be used to inform the ongoing efforts through the National Dementia Strategy to reduce the level of inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotics to treat dementia.","Number and proportion of patients with a diagnosis of dementia

Cataracts occur most commonly due to aging, but may also be due to trauma or a complication of eye surgery for other problems (e.g., glaucoma). Risk factors include diabetes (a disease of high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period), smoking tobacco, prolonged exposure to sunlight, and alcohol consumption. We are especially interested in cataract development in diabetic patients (type I and type II) and in those patients who already developed a complication of their diabetes such as diabetic retinopathy (malfunctioning of a light-sensitive layer in the eye) or macular oedema (i.e., fluid accumulation close to that light-sensitive layer called retina). Scientific reports on cataract rates in these populations are scarce. 
Additionally, we will characterise diabetic cataract patients with respect to potential risk factors for their cataract and compare occurrence of those risk factors in diabetics who have not yet developed a cataract.","The study aims to describe the incidence of cataract in patients with diabetes mellitus in the UK and compare it (stratified by age, sex and year of diagnosis) to a random sample of the general (non-diabetic) population.

We will use COX proportional hazards modelling (adjusted for age, gender and index year of diabetes diagnosis) to assess time to cataract in newly diagnosed diabetic patients. 
Additionally, we will carry out a nested case-control analysis in diabetic patients with or without cataract to identify risk factors for cataract development.

Dexamfetamine is a stimulant which is indicated for ADHD treatment in children and adolescents aged between 6 and 17 years. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) requested this study as part of the risk management plan (RMP), due to concerns that patients exposed to dexamfetamine might have a higher risk for drug abuse and dependence compared with other treatments for ADHD.

Childhood burns can cause scars mental health problems, disability and death. Many of these children need painful treatments throughout their lives and may miss a large amount of school. In the United Kingdom the medical treatment of children with burns occurs in many health settings. This depends on the severity of the injury.  Children are treated in General Practices, Emergency Departments and in specialised Burns Units and Centres in hospitals.
At the moment there are no studies to describe the total number of children who suffer from burns or where they are treated.  This knowledge is important to identify 
 - The size of the problem,
 - Which age groups of children should be prioritised for prevention
 - Whether prevention programmes work
 - How much childhood burns cost the NHS

Once one of these complications has occurred, people are at increased risk of a second complication, so to prevent this, medications that are used as 'blood thinners' (aspirin, clopidogrel) are commonly prescribed. Those medications tend to be less effective at preventing these secondary events in people with diabetes than in the general population. Some newer medications have been introduced which may be more effective in the general population and in people with diabetes (ticagrelor, prasugrel). This study will search for the effects of each of these medications used as blood thinners on diabetes-related complications and death. The costs of treating complications will also be calculated by using information about treatments patients receive from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and hospital-based medical records. Based on the findings about how each medication affects patient outcomes and NHS costs, we will make projections about how the choice of medication affects NHS costs and patient outcomes in the long term. We will estimate what would have happened to NHS costs and patient outcomes if people with type 2 diabetes received the newer blood thinners compared with the older medications.","Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) represent a subgroup of ischaemic heart diseases ranging from unstable angina to transmural myocardial infarction. Type 2 diabetes populations (T2DM) are of particular interest as a subgroup of ACS sufferers, because ACS can occur if T2DM is not managed correctly, and ACS is one of the most costly complications of T2DM. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for the secondary prevention of ACS, with aspirin and clopidogrel being the most commonly prescribed agents. In this study, we aim to identify and investigate the economic impact of different antiplatelet regimens in patients with T2DM post-ACS. Starting from descriptive analyses of the patient population, the variation of outcomes and resource use will be explored and long term costs and health effects of different antiplatelet treatments will be investigated. This will be achieved with the use of time-to-event analysis, cost analysis based on information from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), and the use of a decision analytic model which will estimate the mean per patient cost per quality-adjusted-life year gained from the NHS perspective over lifetime.","Adherence to antiplatelet medicines: Prescription information as recorded from CPRD will be used to estimate patients' adherence to antiplatelet regimens. All-cause mortality: Information about all-cause mortality will be extracted from the CPRD database, ONS and inpatient HES linked datasets.

Gastroenteritis is caused by bacteria or virus that spread through the consumption of contaminated food or water, and from person to person because of improper handwashing. Gastroenteritis severity depends on the immune system's ability to resist the infection, and persons with chronic diseases can be at increased risk of complications. In the majority of diarrhoeal outbreaks and in individual people presenting the infection the specific infectious agent is not known . This study aims to estimate the frequency of infectious gastroenteritis requiring visits to the general practice or hospitalization in the UK, in the general population and among people with diabetes. Because the agent causing the infectious gastroenteritis is often not recorded, we propose a method to estimate the frequency of gastroenteritis episodes caused by the viral agent,  norovirus. This statistical method will attribute a causing agent to those gastroenteritis for which a virus, bacteria or parasite was not recorded, based on the patterns of variation of these infectious agents over the seasons. This study will provide evidence about the frequency of infectious gastroenteritis, those caused by norovirus, and the risks for people with diabetes. Such information will help the design of potential preventive hygienic measures as well as the development of new vaccines.","Infectious gastroenteritis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality with multiple aetiological causes including bacteria and virus. Often the causal agent is not known or  recorded in routine medical practice hindering the estimation of cause-specific burden of disease from electronic medical records. No estimates are available for norovirus-associated hospitalizations in the paediatric population in the UK or for norovirus-associated deaths in children and adults aged under 65 years old. Moreover, the impact of gastroenteritis on chronic conditions, such as diabetes, is not well understood. This study aims to estimate the burden of medically attended gastroenteritis, in primary and secondary care settings, overall and in the diabetic population. To account for limited recording of infectious agent, a statistical model will be developed to estimate the frequency of gastroenteritis episodes attributable to norovirus, based on the temporal patterns of occurrence of gastroenteritis, overall and cause-specific, and accounting for population age groups. The project constitutes a case-study in developing methods to better estimate cause-specific burden of infectious diseases based on electronic medical records, with incomplete data. Evidence of cause-specific burden of disease can greatly improve the design of preventive measures, e.g. vaccination programs, as well as monitoring their public health impact.","The outcome of interest is the occurrence of medically attended acute gastroenteritis (MAAGE) and medically attended norovirus gastroenteritis  (MANGE) episodes with index date within the subject study follow-up (person-time at risk). MAAGE and MANGE episode A MAAGE episode is defined as a series of at least one MAAGE event  with the lag time between successive events not exceeding 14 days. Hence, a recurrence with a lag time of more than 14 days will be considered as a new MAAGE episode. The episode index date is the date of the first MAAGE event of the MAAGE episode. MAAGE episodes will be classified as primary care-only or requiring hospitalization based on the level of care required over the course of the episode. Any episode containing at least one MAAGE event from HES Inpatient will be classified as requiring hospitalization. MAAGE episodes will be further classified according to aetiological cause, e.g. episodes related with Norovirus (MANGE), Rotavirus, Salmonella, Campylobacter, other Bacterial, Clostridium difficile, Parasitic. An algorithm will be developed with MAAGE experts to select a main cause for episodes with multiple cause-specific aetiologies recorded. MAAGE or MANGE associated death will be considered as deaths recorded in the ONS mortality linked data, for which MAAGE or MANGE were recorded as primary or contributory causes of death.","Dr Germano Ferreira - Chief Investigator - Not from an Organisation

More than 10% of adults in the UK have CRS and this can greatly affect their quality of life. Patients may receive a variety of different treatments from their General Practitioner (GP) such as saline nasal drops and drugs including antibiotics and some will also be referred to an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist, when they may be offered further medical treatment or sinus surgery. However, the success of both medical treatment and surgery in treating CRS is unclear and so there may be national variation in how doctors treat people with the condition. Using electronic data collected in daily practice by GPs and hospitals, our research will investigate in detail how patients with CRS are currently treated and managed within the National Health Service (NHS). We will then estimate the benefits of each different treatment strategy on patients'  health and calculate the cost of those treatment strategies, informing policymakers and future practice of GPs and hospital doctors within the NHS.","Aims: Establish what treatments they currently receive from GPs and in NHS hospitals, estimating how effective these are in terms of further healthcare visits and treatments and how much they cost, to inform future trial design and improve patient pathways. 
1. Current management analysis: Linked national Electronic Health Records (EHR) data will be used to map current care pathways and estimate the effectiveness of medical and surgical interventions, determine referral patterns and quantify rates of primary care consultation, hospitalisation, prescriptions (particularly antibiotic and steroid use) and surgical intervention. The denominator for all rates calculated will be person-time at risk and Poisson regression will be used to calculate confidence intervals. 
2. Health economic analysis: Cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments/pathways identified above will be conducted to inform the trial design and identify deficiencies in anticipated data collection that could be focused upon to design a future trial that will be used to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatment of patients with CRS. The analysis will use decision analytic modelling using outputs from the current management analysis supplemented with data from published studies. 

This research will help us understand how CRS is recorded, understand the pathways of care as wells as the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these pathways.","Long-term measures of health status: GP consultation rate, surgery, prescriptions of antibiotics and steroids and 30-day mortality (all cause, respiratory and cardiac).","Claire Hopkins - Chief Investigator - Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust

A number of studies have been shown emollients, in particular colloidal emollients, to be safe and effective for the treatment of dry skin and inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema. It is suspected though that adherence with this recommendation for emollient therapy is generally poor. This can be for a number of reasons, including them not being offered or prescribed, failure to prescribe adequate quantities and patients not using them as frequently as necessary for optimal benefit. There is limited evidence on the impact of the use of emollients in terms of cost avoidance and reduction in the use of topical corticosteroids (TCS). Topical corticosteroids are most commonly prescribed for eczema topically. They have many functions but among other things they are very effective at temporarily controlling inflammation. Very strong or potent TCS should not be used for prolonged periods of time over large areas of eczematous skin, due to concerns about potential side effects. Whereas most TCS are not expensive, some TCS can be relatively costly. Our study is designed to understand prescribing patterns in the UK and outcomes based on those prescriptions. In addition, our study was designed to evaluate whether patients treated with emollients as first line therapy had similar or lower needs for TCS and/or antibiotics. The economic analysis will be done based on NHS's perspective, thus focusing on costs to the NHS (cost of visits and medication).","Study objectives: To evaluate overall prescribing patterns and the frequency of visits and prescriptions (frequency and type) for dry skin/eczema (DS-E) in patients treated with emollients as the first-line therapy at time of first diagnosis of DS-E, compared with patients not treated with emollients. Patients in this study will be followed over 36 continuous months in 5 calendar years, including 12 months prior to the first emollient prescription, and 24 months after for patients with a DS-E diagnosis. Methods: Cohort identification: Research-grade patients with a diagnosis of DS-E in 2008-2012 and at least 12 months of continuous eligibility prior to the first diagnosis are included in the study sample. Patients treated with at least 2 distinct prescriptions for emollients from the day of index up to 6 months of index skin condition diagnosis will be identified ('Emollient Cohort') and when available, the brand of the Emollient will be included as a variable. For patients in the Emollient cohort, the first emollient prescription fill date will be their index date, they will be required to have 12 months continuous eligibility prior to and 24 months following the index date, such that for the 12 months before and 24 months after the index date, there will be complete primary care records and prescriptions. The control group will be patients with no emollient prescription but at least 2 healthcare exposures (visits or non-emollient prescriptions) within 6 months of first diagnosis. Patients will further be matched for age (0-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-18 year, 19-64, and 65+ years) , gender (male, female), prior prescription patterns (prior use of systemic and TCS) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (a general index of health) and history of atopic conditions (asthma, food allergies and allergic rhinitis). A one-to-one match will be conducted using propensity score matching. For patients in the non-emollient cohort, their first prescription fill date, or first diagnosis date if no prescription used, will be the index date. Data analytics: CPRD database is the primary data source for this study. Prescription patterns and cost of care associated with DS-E condition (GP visit cost + cost of prescription medication + cost of referrals (consultant costs)) will be estimated for all patients using published BNF and PSSRU data.","Outcomes will be established within 24 months of index. GP visits: All visits will be characterized as related to skin disease, or not.  Relevant visits will be analysed in terms of frequency, for all patients. Prescription Use: All prescriptions associated with skin condition visits will be identified and grouped based on BNF chapter . All emollients will be identified by brand whenever possible. The frequency of prescriptions and prescription types/names will be analysed separately for both cohorts.","Dr Chantal E. Holy - Chief Investigator - Johnson & Johnson (JnJ - USA)

Warfarin also increases the risk of bleeding, which is why physicians change the dose regularly according to the results of a specific blood test. However, there are reports that warfarin may also increase the risk of fractures, and that this risk cannot be predicted by the results of a routine blood test. Fractures in people taking blood thinners are important because their higher risk of bleeding makes it more complicate to operate. Also, fractures may cause subsequent disability, and stopping the blood thinner may bring back the risk of stroke. Also, three new blood thinners were approved in 2011 for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and the risk of fractures with these medications is unknown. We will therefore conduct a study of patients with newly-diagnosed atrial fibrillation and compare the risk of fractures with warfarin and the new oral anticoagulants with that of aspirin or similar drugs.","The objective of this study is to examine fracture risk with the use of oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. We will assemble a cohort of patients newly-diagnosed with atrial fibrillation between 1998 and 2015 using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with linkage to the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Cohort entry will be defined by the date of atrial fibrillation diagnosis, as determined by Read codes in CPRD. Primary exposure will be defined in a time-dependent fashion as current use of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), separately, and the reference group will be the use of antiplatelet drugs. The primary outcome will be the first hospitalization with a diagnosis of rib, spine, hip or wrist fracture, identified in HES by international classification of diseases-10 codes. Time-dependent Cox models will be used to assess the hazard ratio for hospitalized osteoporotic fractures associated with current use of VKA or DOACs, compared with antiplatelet use. Secondary analyses will include duration-response analyses of fracture risk with VKA and DOAC use, stratification of patients by age and history of osteoporosis, and stratification of the outcome by fracture type.","The composite of rib, wrist, hip, and spine fractures identified in HES.","Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

It works by increasing the blood flow through the blood vessels of the heart. It improves the blood and oxygen supply of the heart muscle and reduces its workload. Nicorandil is used to prevent or attenuate painful, straining symptoms (angina pectoris) of heart disease. Nicorandil may cause injuries to the gastrointestinal tract such as ulcers. This can develop problems such as bleeding, fistula, holes, abscess, especially in patients with diverticular disease (a digestive condition affecting the large intestine). Regulatory authorities recommended to conduct a safety study to quantify the risk of ulceration (including all sites of occurrence), and related events (including perforations, fistula, abscess and bleeding) and identify any person with an increased risk of developing those events. 
We will use routinely collected health information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The findings of our study are expected to help ascertain the rates of of ulceration in patients treated with nicorandil, as well as subsequent erosion, perforation, haemorrhages, abscesses formation, fistulae and delayed wound healing and, to identify other potential risk factors, thereby aiding the development of preventive measures.","The purpose of this study is to quantify the time-related risk and patterns of erosions, ulcerations, perforations, haemorrhages, abscesses, fistulae, delayed wound healing in patients treated with nicorandil (including gastrointestinal, skin, ocular, mucosal, anal; alone or in multiple locations), and death; together with the exploration of high risk subgroups, other risk factors, and a dose and time effect assessment. 

This is a retrospective cohort study using the UK CPRD database. The inclusion criteria will be: patients aged 18 and older, with a diagnosis of angina pectoris between 01/01/1995 and 31/12/2014, and an initial prescription for Nicorandil. They will be longitudinally followed-up until end of observation period or death. Exposure will be determined individually for each patient. Outcomes of interest will include Perforation, Ulcer, Fistula, Abscess, Erosion, Diverticulosis, Diverticulitis, Death, Delayed wound healing, haemorrhages (PUFAEDH). Standard descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier time to event assessment and Cox proportional hazards modelling will be used. The main outcomes will be the incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals for the outcomes of interest, as stratified by variables.

First introduced in the UK in 2007, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are second- to third-line therapies used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. While these therapies have been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes and inducing weight loss, there are emerging concerns that these drugs may increase the risk of breast cancer. To date, no study conducted in the real-world setting has been conducted to assess this association

Such studies are urgently needed to assess if this risk is substantiated. This study will investigate whether the use of GLP-1 agonists is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This study will provide much needed information of this potential association, which will be of value to regulatory agencies, physicians, and patients.","Recent evidence from preclinical studies and randomised controlled trials suggest that GLP-1 agonists may increase the risk of breast cancer.

The treatment of PD varies across regions due to recommended guidelines and regulations. Therefore results from studies cannot be generalized to different regions. There is limited information available on the treatment patterns of PD patients in the UK. The purpose of this study therefore is to describe characteristics and treatment patterns of newly diagnosed PD patients in the UK. We will use data from the Clinical Practice Research Database linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics database from 1 January 2004 to 30 September 2015 to conduct the study. We will obtain information using coded data that will be extracted from the database to identify patients with a new diagnosis of PD, and to describe their treatment history. We will describe the types of PD medications prescribed, the duration of the prescribed medication and the outcome of each prescribed treatment. Results from this study will provide rich information on the treatment pathways that PD patients in the UK experience from the time of diagnosis. The study will also assess whether or not treatment is in line with the recommended treatment guidelines for PD in the UK.","There is limited published data available on treatment patterns of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

Due to stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria in clinical trials, there may remain overt differences in some important characteristics between the trial participants and the real-world population for whom the treatment would be indicated (i.e., the target population). These characteristics may affect treatment effects, leading to problems in generalizing trial results to the target population. Several methods of generalizing trial results have been proposed to overcome this limitation; however, these methods require all data of every individual in both the trial and the target population (i.e., individual-level data). Obtaining individual-level data for the trial and the target population may be a resource-intensive undertaking, whereas aggregate-level data (i.e., data at the level of subgroup, such as the total numbers of male and female patients, respectively) can often be easily retrieved from the literature. Little is known about these generalizing methods using aggregate-level data, thus this study aims to evaluate different approaches to generalize trial results to target populations using aggregate-level data, using the JUPITER trial and CPRD data. This study provides new information on use of individual-level versus aggregate-level data in these approaches of generalizing trial results.","The objective of this study is to explore different approaches to generalize clinical trial results to the target population when only aggregate data or subgroup-specific results are available in either clinical trial or real-world data. We use data from the JUPITER trial and the CPRD, and examine the following three methods of generalizing the trial results. The first method is weighting methods based on predicted probabilities from multivariable models. For a given data source with aggregate data, we simulate a hypothetical cohort which is consisted of fake individual data, and apply these methods to standardize the JUPITER trial results to the CPRD population. We compare the estimates of generalized trial results based on individual data to the estimates based on aggregate data. The second is to estimate the absolute risk reduction for anticipated treatment effect in the target population. We calculate the cardiovascular risk in the CPRD patients without receiving statins, and multiply it by the relative risk reduction observed in the JUPITER trial. The third is to estimate the statin effect by computing a weighted average of the subgroup-specific treatment effect estimates in the JUPITER trial with weights from the population distributions of effect modifiers in the CPRD.","The primary end point is the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event, defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, an arterial revascularization procedure, or confirmed death from cardiovascular causes.","Til Sturmer - Chief Investigator - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

We are particularly interested in establishing what proportion of stroke events are recorded in primary care databases (completeness) and how specific the coded events are in terms of the main types of stroke (diagnostic accuracy). We will do this by identifying the same stroke event in multiple data sources (CPRD, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and mortality data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS)) and comparing the way in which they are recorded and coded. 

Our proposed study will help to establish the best strategy for identifying individuals who have experienced a stroke in electronic healthcare records, including CPRD.  This would inform the definitions and patient selection for future observational studies that rely on CPRD and other sources of healthcare data, including our own.","The overall aim of this study is to assess the completeness and diagnostic validity of the recording of stroke, by subtype, in primary care using HES as a reference. To this end we will construct - using HES in-patient data - a retrospective cohort of patients who have been hospitalised and diagnosed as having had a stroke. For those patients with linked CPRD-HES records, we will compare various aspects of the recording of individual stroke events across the two data sources. We will conduct a similar exercise using ONS data. 

We will assess the completeness of the recording of stroke events in CPRD in a Venn diagram. We will also investigate the level of event date agreement across data sources. If we find a significant proportion of unrecorded stroke events in CPRD, we will perform logistic regression analyses to establish whether factors such as age, sex, year of stroke and mortality are contributing to the suboptimal recording of stroke in primary care. In addition, we will assess the diagnostic accuracy of CPRD stroke recording by subtype (ischaemic, subarachnoid hemorrhagic, intracerebral haemorrhagic, TIAs) and determine the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of different stroke code sets (all stroke and for stroke subtypes).",Subarachnoid haemorrhage; intracerebral haemorrhage; cerebral infarction; stroke not specified as haemorrhage or infarction; transient cerebral ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and related syndromes.,"Professor Jennifer Quint - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

Steroid inhalers are commonly prescribed, but there is uncertainty over how beneficial they are to all patients living with COPD, and steroid inhalers are expensive and have been associated with a range of adverse effects including an increased risk of pneumonia. Some patients with COPD have higher levels of a type of cell called eosinophils in their blood and lungs suggesting greater inflammation in their lungs and thus greater chance of benefit from steroid inhalers. However, this hasn't been investigated yet in general practice using results of blood levels of eosinophils that have been routinely tested for other reasons. In this study, we will use general practice records to evaluate whether patients who have higher levels of blood eosinophils on routinely taken blood tests before starting treatment with inhaled steroids are more likely to have fewer exacerbations and less deterioration on treatment compared to patients with lower levels of blood eosinophils.","This study will use a new user cohort design to assess outcomes for a group of COPD patients who have not previously been prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS-naive) and who then commence treatment with a new inhaled maintenance treatment (the index date).

The hypothesis-testing component will test whether baseline blood eosinophil values predict disease outcomes, and outcomes under treatment (ICS responsiveness). The primary outcome will be acute exacerbations of COPD. Patients will be divided into two groups based on whether the new inhaled maintenance medication is an ICS or long-acting bronchodilator. Disease outcomes over time will be compared between those patients starting treatment with ICS and those starting treatment with a long-acting bronchodilator, with adjustment for baseline characteristics, and this will be stratified by baseline blood eosinophil values to determine whether this modifies effectiveness of treatment.","Primary outcome: exacerbations of COPD (time-to-first exacerbation, as well as sensitivity analyses on number/year, and 2 exacerbations/year)

The cost of OA treatment such as pain relief or joint replacement is substantial and increases with the increasing average age of our society. 
Statins are drugs, which lower lipid levels in the blood and which are prescribed to prevent heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 11% of the population in the United Kingdom (UK) are prescribed statins. Experiments in cells and animals have demonstrated that statins reduce inflammation and alter the immune response in OA-affected areas of the body. Results from studies in humans are contradictory. Finger joints are non weight bearing; therefore, they present an ideal joint in which to study the effect of statins on development of OA since pressure on joints by body weight only, as occurs in the hip or knee, does not apply.

Recently, a safety concern arose with the use of valproate medicines in pregnant women specifically, a potential risk of malformations and developmental problems was identified in children exposed to valproate in the womb. A decision was made by the European Medicines Agency to recommend restricting the use of valproate to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder in girls and in women who are pregnant or who can become pregnant unless other treatments are not effective or not tolerated. In addition to these recommendations, targeted educational material surrounding these risks is being sent to prescribers and to women prescribed valproate in the UK. 

This study is being conducted to assess if there are demonstrable differences in prescribing practices in the UK since the introduction of these measures, by looking at practices before and after their introduction, in women overall and in subpopulations of interest (pregnant women and women of child bearing potential). This will then be used to inform the EMA as to the effectiveness of such measures or whether further measures may be required to ensure safe prescribing of this medicine.","An assessment of the impact of dissemination of risk minimisation measures (i.e. educational materials and Dear Healthcare Professional Communication) and an assessment of these measures is planned. To meet the primary study objective, a main analysis will be performed on two 3-year periods before and after the implementation of risk minimisation measures, by subgroup of population (girls and women of childbearing potential). The main analysis will be descriptive and will provide information on demographics; medical history; valproate indication, dosage and duration; usage of medications related to any of the valproate indications; concomitant medications prescribed; hormonal contraceptives and IUD; co-morbidities; pregnancies. 

Interim reports will be conducted every 6 months until the final report. An interrupted time series report will be considered for the final report if conditions are met in which data are evaluated at multiple time points before and after an intervention in order to detect whether or not an intervention had a significantly greater effect than any underlying trend.

Within the CPRD, all patients (at least 18 years of age) who have their first ever prescription record for a non-insulin antidiabetic drug (NIAD) recorded will be selected as cases.. To each T2DM patient, one control patient (no T2DM) without a NIAD or insulin prescription during the entire study period will be selected using incidence density sampling, and will be matched by year of birth, sex, and GP practice. Use of parenteral CS will be determined by reviewing dispensing information before index date. Conditional logistic regression analysis will be used to estimate the risk of T2DM therapy associated with use of parenteral CS and the various confounding variables.",Cases will be defined as patients with a new onset of T2DM.

1616632567-1951,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=38,Age- and lifestyle-related chronic disease and causes of mortality among adults with cerebral palsy in the United Kingdom.,"Approximately 1 in every 400 adults in the UK has cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is a condition that results from an injury to the developing brain that primarily affects a person's ability to move. Adults with cerebral palsy experience a number of secondary conditions with age such as chronic fatigue and pain. These symptoms feed into a negative cycle of decline in mobility, physical inactivity, and physical condition, which may lead adults with CP to develop chronic diseases such as heart disease. A recent study reported that adults with cerebral palsy in the US have significantly higher estimates of stroke, hypertension, other heart conditions and arthritis, compared with adults without cerebral palsy. To date, the prevalence of chronic diseases hasn't been investigated in adults with cerebral palsy in the UK. We propose to examine the prevalence of chronic diseases, medical resource utilisation and associated costs, and causes of mortality among adults with cerebral palsy in the UK. This will provide important information for planning future healthcare provision for adults with cerebral palsy in the UK.","The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence of chronic diseases, medical resource utilisation and associated costs, and causes of mortality among adults with cerebral palsy (CP) in the UK. We will compare adults with CP and matched controls without CP. Chronic diseases of interest are type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, hypertensive diseases, ischaemic heart diseases, other heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic pain, arthritis, depression and anxiety, dementia, osteoporosis, incontinence, cancers (i.e. oesophageal, colon, lung, breast, prostate), falls, diseases of the digestive system, hearing impairment, visual impairment. Medical resource utilisation will be identified as the number of primary care and outpatient consultations, the rate and length of hospitalisation, and number of prescriptions issued and investigations ordered. For each outcome, a regression model will be fitted, adjusting for covariates (body mass index, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, marital status, education, income, level of disability, and level of physical activity). Overall mortality rates and mortality rates stratified by the most frequent ICD-10 chapter headings will be calculated. Standardised mortality rates will be calculated as a ratio of the observed number of deaths among adults with CP to the expected number of deaths in the general population.","A first event of the following chronic diseases will be ascertained using a record of a Read code from the clinical file: type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, bronchitis, emphysema and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, hypertensive diseases, ischaemic heart diseases, other heart diseases (including pulmonary embolism, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and flutter), falls, diseases of the digestive system, hearing impairment, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, depression and anxiety, dementia, osteoporosis, incontinence, cancers (i.e. oesophageal, colon, lung, breast, prostate), hearing impairment, and visual impairment. 

Medical resource utilisation will be determined using the following variables: 
- The overall primary care consultation rate will be calculated as the sum of all recorded consultations in primary care. Each consultation will be classified by consultation type and staff type using information from the Consultation file. 
- The overall rate of outpatient consultations will be calculated as the sum of all recorded outpatient appointments in the outpatient HES data. 
- The overall hospitalisation rate will be calculated as the sum of all recorded hospital admissions in the subpopulation of people with linked HES data. 
- The length of hospitalisation will be calculated by subtracting the admission date from the discharge date in the inpatient HES data. 
- The number of prescriptions issued will be obtained from the Therapy file. 
- The number of investigations ordered including pathology and diagnostic services will be obtained from the Test file. These will be grouped by investigation type. 

The cost associated with medical resource utilisation will be defined as follows: 
- Each primary care consultation will be assigned an average cost as listed in the Unit Cost of Health and Social Care 2010 from the Personal Social Services Research Unit. 
- Each outpatient visit will be allocated an outpatient tariff. 
- The cost of inpatient admissions will be calculated using NHS Reference Costs. 
- Each prescription will attributed a net ingredient cost from the corresponding year of the Prescription Cost Analysis. 
- Each investigation will be allocated a cost using NHS Reference Costs. 

Causes of death will be determined and grouped using ICD-10 chapter headings recorded in the ONS death register.","Jennifer Ryan - Chief Investigator - Brunel University

Connectivity mapping was conducted using publically available gene expression datasets.  This connectivity map process has been implemented and has identified prescription medications (used for non-cancer purposes) that potentially alter risk of breast cancer progression. 

The aim of this study is to determine the association between use of the identified medications (from connectivity mapping) after breast cancer diagnosis and risk of breast cancer-specific mortality.    

The study could identify (previously unrecognized) medications which increase the risk of breast cancer progression; current licensing and use of such medications may need to be reconsidered. This study also has the potential to identify licensed medications that reduce risk of breast cancer progression and warrant further study in clinical trials.","Background: Connectivity mapping is a novel bioinformatics technique linking gene expression data with expression events induced by medications. It therefore allows medications to be screened to assess carcinogenicity and anti-cancer properties.

Aims: To determine the association between use of the identified medications (from connectivity mapping) and breast-cancer specific mortality.  

Methods:  A cohort study will be conducted.  Breast cancer patients will be identified from cancer registries. Candidate medication use will be determined from prescription records and cancer-specific mortality from ONS mortality records.  Cox regression models (with medication use as a time-varying covariate) will be used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs), for the association between candidate medication use after diagnosis and cancer-specific mortality after adjustment for potential confounders.

1616632565-1950,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=38,A data-driven approach for  identifying falls subgroups through semantic similarity analysis,"Falls in the elderly are a serious health issue worldwide. 32% of adults aged above 65 years fall at least once a year. These falls are often serious and can lead to serious health problems, including disability and mortality. If we want to reduce the health impact of falls on people and the costs they impose on the health budget, then we need to understand what it is that make people more likely to have a fall. The data contained within the clinical practice research datalink (CPRD) could help find these factors. The most common way to use CPRD has been to answer very specific questions. For example, does having a particular disease cause some patients to experience falls? But are there other equally important questions that could be asked of the data that people haven't yet thought to ask? In this project we are using a new method to explore the CPRD data to find features or patterns in this data that can predict which people are most likely to have a dangerous fall. Some of these patterns we find will already be known, however this new strategy has the potential to find new and important associations.","The objective of this study is to determine how to find good hypotheses from large health datasets. Our primary question is, how should we let the data guide us to find good questions? How do we use the data to learn what good questions to ask the data? Traditionally, population-based studies are used to ask whether there is a support for particular hypotheses. Instead, can we use CPRD data to identify what the good questions are? We are exploring a new strategy for diagnostic hypotheses formulation to analyse medical data. We plan to map CPRD data into a low dimensional space using semantic similarity analysis to provide a good representation of the data, in which visualisation and clustering are much easier. Then classic data mining techniques can be used in order to generate hypotheses that can be used to understand what the factors are that lead to falls and what those that are the conditions caused by falls? Falls provide a particularly rich data set for this study. It is a diagnosis that is relatively common in a population that has significant contact with general practitioners (older people), making it a suitable case study to test the methodology.",GP records of fall as recorded via Read codes.,"Professor Andy Brass - Chief Investigator - University of Manchester

1616632560-1948,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=38,"Discovering prognostic subtypes of cardiovascular diseases, using linked electronic healthcare records from 2 million people","It is becoming increasingly clear that many cardiovascular diseases (e.g. heart disease) are not as homogenous as previously thought. This can be seen in the multifactorial causes of many of these diseases (where no single risk factor is necessary nor sufficient), and also in the increasing use of risk prediction models to rank patients based on their future risk of unfavourable outcomes. At present we cannot classify these risk factors into discrete categorical subtypes and typologies. Secondly, various risk prediction models are used at different times along the course of disease progression, but these have not been united into a unified model of how individuals progress from full health to death along various clinical encounters. 
We plan to analyse data from a dataset called CALIBER, which links records for millions of patients from General Practitioners, hospitals and national statistics, using various visualization and statistical techniques. We aim to generate new hypotheses about possible underlying subtypes of cardiovascular disease progression, which we will then test with genetic data, if possible. Our findings may lead to a more personalized approach to the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases, efficient use of healthcare resources, and the application of our research methods to the study of other chronic diseases in the future.","Objectives: 1) To visualize the pathways through which individuals transition from full health to death, along intermediating cardiovascular diagnoses. 2) To use the visualization to identify potential prognostic subtypes. 3) To describe the predictors of these subtypes, especially the role of biomarkers and comorbidities/multimorbidity. 4) To evaluate the causality of any biomarkers identified.
Participants: Baseline participants (ca 2 million patients from CPRD, who at entry between 1997-2010 are aged 30+) are followed up for morbidity and mortality with CPRD, HES, ONS and MINAP databases, to identify 22 cardiovascular outcomes (including coronary, stroke, and arrythmic events) and one non-cardiovascular outcome (major haemorrhage).
Methods: 1-2) Alluvial diagrams will be used to describe the progression of participants from health to death. 3) Classical Cox survival models will be adapted to identify which predictors describe each subtype. 4) Mendelian Randomization will be applied to data (probably the UK Biobank) for causal inference.
We are not aware of previous work that used electronic healthcare record data, to identify subtypes of disease progression. Thus if our results are validated by future studies, it could hold methodological value in demonstrating the utility of these methods for analyzing large-scale EHR datasets to identify phenotypic subtypes of disease.","Fatal outcomes: coronary heart disease death; cardiac arrest; other cardiovascular disease death; non-cardiovascular disease death
Non-fatal outcomes: Cardiovascular disease states: stable angina; unstable angina; STEMI; NSTEMI; other coronary heart disease; transient ischaemic attack; ischaemic stroke; subarachnoid haemorrhage; intracerebral haemorrhage; other stroke; mitral valve disease; aortic valve disease; other valve disease; atrial fibrillation ; other conduction disorder; peripheral vascular disease; abdominal aortic aneurysm; heart failure ; miscellaneous cardiovascular diseases; Net use of healthcare services","Professor Harry Hemingway - Chief Investigator - University College London ( UCL )

Eczema is a challenging disease causing significant problems for sufferers and their families. The severity of eczema can vary substantially between individuals and within individuals over time. Even in mild eczema, the itch and soreness can affect all aspects of quality of life, including quality and quantity of sleep, poor school attendance, time off work in adulthood and poor self esteem, resulting from visible skin disease. Despite the importance of eczema, basic questions remain unanswered, including who will develop medical problems related to their eczema?
There are many reasons why eczema might be associated with worse medical problems. Eczema is associated with changes in the immune system, including inflammation and reduced ability to fight infections. Eczema may also be associated with lifestyle factors, relating to the effect of eczema on quality of life. There is increasing evidence that eczema may be associated with a range of important medical outcomes. This study will take advantage of a large data set that follows many individuals over time to determine if there is an association between eczema and selected adverse outcomes.","The objectives of this study are to use data from Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD) and Hospital Episodes Statistics to examine associations between eczema and a range of serious medical outcomes which may be associated with inflammation.

However, this result may be due to the second antibiotic in the combination drug (sulfamethoxazole) rather than the trimethoprim, or may be because the combination antibiotic was used for patients with more severe infections than the antibiotics it was compared with. We will investigate this by looking at the association between treatment with trimethoprim and sudden death. To check whether any difference we see in the amount of sudden death in those on trimethoprim compared to other antibiotics is due to infection severity, we will investigate the association between trimethoprim and sudden death in patients treated for the same type of infection (urinary tract infection). It has been suggested that if trimethoprim does cause sudden death, this is because it also causes high potassium levels or sudden decrease in kidney function. Therefore we will also investigate the association between the type of antibiotic treatment and these other outcomes. The results will help in forming guidelines for treatment of infections in people who are at high risk of these outcomes.","We aim to investigate the association between trimethoprim and sudden death. We will identify a cohort of all patients over 65 during the period April 1997 to September 2015. 
To test whether trimethoprim is associated with sudden death, we will use logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders, to estimate the odds ratio of sudden death following antibiotic prescription for trimethoprim compared to amoxicillin, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, or cefalexin. To limit confounding by antibiotic indication we will restrict the analysis to patients with antibiotic prescription for urinary tract infection. We will also examine whether diabetes mellitus, and ACEI/ARB or potassium-sparing diuretic therapy, modify the effect of trimethoprim on sudden death.
We will investigate acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia (proposed as causal mechanisms for sudden death in this context) as secondary outcomes. We will examine the robustness of our results through sensitivity analyses.

Individuals assessed as being at an elevated risk are offered a personalised risk management intervention. As part of ongoing evaluation of the programme's outcomes, we aim to use CPRD data to evaluate the long-term impact of the NHSHC programme, since its introduction in 2009. In this study, we aim to evaluate changes in risk factors, risk factor management, occurrence of strokes and heart attacks and mortality outcomes. This will be done by comparing these outcomes between a those who participated in the health check programme and those who did not initially receive a health check. The results will provide an assessment of the programme's effectiveness.","A new programme of NHS Health Checks (NHSHC) was introduced in the UK in 2009. This aims to provide cardiovascular risk assessment every five years for adults aged 40-74 who are not already diagnosed with CVD or diabetes. The NHSHC offers a promising strategy for preventing CVD, yet several concerns have been raised in relation to its uptake, cost-effectiveness, success in reducing diseases and effectiveness of risk management. In this context, evaluation of the programme's longer-term outcomes is crucial. This study aims at evaluating changes in risk and cardiovascular clinical events and mortality outcomes following uptake of a health check. We will use a matched cohort design in the CPRD by comparing participants with a record of a complete NHSHC between 1st of April 2010 and 31st of March 2013 with follow-up data available for a minimum of three years after their health check up to 31st March 2016, together with matched control participants who did not receive a health check. We will adopt a time-to-event framework with date of check as the start date to evaluate the onset of new prescriptions. Hazard ratios will be estimated using the cox proportional hazards model and incident rate ratios using Poisson regression to examine the association between the programme and changes in clinical events and mortality.","Primary outcomes: Data will be analysed for changes in all-cause mortality and CHD and stroke clinical events, diabetes diagnosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis. Where feasible stroke will be classified as haemorrhagic or ischaemic. CHD events will be classified as angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention and other. To ascertain cases of diabetes, diabetes drug prescriptions will be analysed by mapping drug codes to chapter subheadings in the British National Formulary.

It affects an estimated 415 million people in 2015. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, as the most common form of diabetes, accounts for 85% to 95% of all cases. Metformin is an oral antidiabetic drug and currently is the first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin use, for example, adherence, discontinuation, in recent years is particularly important given the approval of several new drugs for type 2 diabetes treatment.  The purpose of this study is to describe latest metformin use pattern in T2D patients including the percentage of patients who discontinued metformin (discontinuation), the percentage of patients who did not take metformin as asked by the physicians (adherence), and the percentage of patient who did not received the maximum dose of metformin (optimal dose). We will further examine what type of patients discontinued metformin, were not adherent to metformin, or never got the maximum dose of metformin. Findings from this study will help to understand the metformin use in the UK and identify potential population who did not receive appropriate treatment for their type 2 diabetes. This study will ultimately to help better manage type 2 diabetes in the UK.","The primary aims to describe metformin use pattern in T2DM patients and the secondary objective is to evaluate factors associated with metformin non-adherence, discontinuation and sub-optimal dose.

One logistic model is to evaluate patient demographic and clinical factors associated with metformin non-adherence (proportion of days covered-PDC <80%) and another is to evaluate factors associated with sub-optimal metformin dose during the follow-up period.   For metformin discontinuation, Cox proportional hazards regression model will be conducted to assess factors associated with discontinuation.","Total number of metformin prescriptions

Meningioma is a common type of brain cancer deriving from the cerebral meninges, which are the membranes enveloping the brain. 
We propose to conduct a study using the U.K.-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to analyse the associations between diabetes and use of metformin in relation to the risk of meningioma.","Using data from the CPRD, we intend to perform a matched case-control analysis to explore the association between diabetes, use of metformin, and risk of meningioma.

Ten control patients will be matched to each case on age, sex, calendar time, general practice, and number of years of active history in the CPRD prior to the index date. 
Relative risks will be estimated by conducting conditional logistic regression analyses to determine odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Most GI infections are self-limiting without the need for medical intervention. However some people develop severe illness/complications requiring medical attention. The burden of complications following infection across the population and resulting economic impact on primary and secondary healthcare settings has not been described. Known risk factors for GI infection may have a role in the development of complications but current evidence is weak. For example, drugs affecting the acidity of the stomach and antibiotics are thought to increase the risk of GI infection, and perhaps the severity of illness. Linking patients' records across primary and secondary care using two large databases (Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) will allow us to find out how often complications from GI infection occur in both settings. Information about patient characteristics and treatments will allow us to determine possible risk factors. We will also use death registration data to find out how often deaths occur after GI infection, and deprivation data to see if there are any differences between socioeconomic groups. The results will give us information about how often complications occur after GI infection, how much they cost to the health care system, and guide possible ways to prevent them.","The purpose of this research is to determine the incidence of sequelae following common GI infections, associated risk factors and the economic impact across primary and secondary healthcare settings. Sequelae of interest include reactive arthritis (ReA) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), both commonly diagnosed in primary care; rare complications such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), sepsis and Crohn's disease, commonly diagnosed in secondary care; and extraintestinal manifestations such as rheumatoid arthritis. To address this, we will conduct a retrospective cohort study of linked primary care, secondary care, death and deprivation data from 2000-2015 to describe the incidence of sequelae following infection with non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and Campylobacter in England. We will test the hypothesis that use of certain classes of antibiotics (quinolones, macrolides and cephalosporins) and acid-reducing drugs are associated with the development of complications. Additionally, we will quantify resource use and associated costs across healthcare settings. The results from this study will provide more robust estimates of the incidence of sequelae following GI infections, the effect of associated risk factors and the economic burden, thereby informing current strategies to reduce exposure to infection and allocate resources efficiently.","Reactive Arthritis, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, GP consultations, Laboratory tests, Referrals,  Prescriptions, Gastrointestinal hospital admission, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Sepsis, Rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, Ulcerative colitis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Death","Dr Rafael Perera - Chief Investigator - University of Oxford

To date, only one observational study has examined the association between this therapy and Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study is to assess whether patients diagnosed with prostate cancer who are treated with androgen deprivation therapy are at an increased risk of dementia (including Alzheimer's disease), in comparison to patients who are not treated with this therapy.","The association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a mainstay treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and dementia is controversial.

The use of ADT will be treated as a time-varying variable, with exposure lagged by one year for latency considerations and to minimize reverse causality. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model will be used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% CI) of incident dementia associated with use of ADT when compared with non-use of ADT.

Common health problems associated with obesity include heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems and mobility difficulties, all of which can significantly impact on the quality of life of those affected. Surgical treatments for obesity are now being used more frequently, but some of the long-term (i.e. over several years) effects of treatment are not known. We have previously done a study in the CPRD to compare several long-term outcomes in people having surgery for weight loss with similar people who have not had weight loss surgery but are also over weight. Now we plan to use the same study population to see whether people who have weight loss surgery are less likely to have future kidney problems. We will compare the occurrence of these outcomes in obese people who undergo weight loss surgery with obese people who do not undergo surgery. The results of this study will improve the evidence base available to doctors and patients trying to decide the best treatment options for people with obesity.","We will investigate the association between bariatric surgery and renal outcomes in obese people in the United Kingdom, focusing on: i) reaching a threshold level of renal function; ii) incidence of chronic kidney disease; and iii) incidence of acute kidney injury. To achieve this we will look at people who receive bariatric surgery, based on their CPRD record, and compare them with people who are also obese but did not receive bariatric surgery. Outcomes will be defined using estimated glomerular filtration rate (calculated using CPRD serum creatinine results) and evidence of hospitalisation due to acute kidney injury using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Propensity score matching will be used to achieve comparability between the surgery and non-surgery group to help us deal with potential confounding. Cox regression will then be used to compare how often the outcomes occur in each group, resulting in a hazard ratio for each outcome.","Baseline Renal Function - will be defined as: i) best of two: the highest eGFR from the most recent two serum creatinine results recorded in the 12 months prior to index and separated by a minimum of three months (three month timeframe chosen to correspond to the requirement for eGFR to remain at a consistent level of impairment for at least three months in order for a patient to be diagnosed at a specific CKD stage); or ii) if only one suitable creatinine result is available, the single most recent serum creatinine recorded prior to baseline. 

eGFR threshold - Renal function will be defined using serum creatinine test results to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the CKD-EPI equation. 

CKD - As for eGFR threshold, but also requiring a second measure of eGFR <60 at least three months later. 

Acute kidney injury - will be defined as the first episode of AKI identified within 28 days of the start of a hospital admission identified using ICD-10 morbidity coding in HES, to capture cases of AKI that were present at hospital admission but may have not been immediately diagnosed, without excluding cases that resulted in a prolonged admission.

DAPT is given to people who have had a heart attack and had a coronary stent put in (a wire-mesh tube placed in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart, to keep them open) or heart bypass surgery (a type of surgery that improves blood flow to the heart).  Some people are prescribed an anticoagulant, another type of drug that also prevents blood clots, at the same time. 

DAPT and anticoagulants increase the risk of bleeding.  Some people experience major bleeding that needs hospitalisation.  Many more people experience minor bleeding, such as bleeding in the stomach or bowel, nosebleeds, bleeding from gums, and excessive bruising.  This can cause discomfort and anxiety, take up consultations with GPs and may cause patients to stop taking their medications as prescribed.  

We propose to use CPRD GOLD, a large GP database of routinely collected data, and Hospital Episode Statistics, a database describing patients' attendances and admissions to hospital, to determine how many people experience bleeding after being prescribed DAPT.  We will compare patients who take different combinations of DAPT (with or without an anticoagulant).","Objective: To quantify the incidence of all bleeding events in patients exposed to different regimens of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) or triple therapy (DAPT and an anticoagulant) and to estimate hazard ratios for bleeding for different antiplatelet regimens. 
Methods: Retrospective population-based cohort study. We will identify three patient cohorts, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treated by medication only, in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).  We will follow all patient cohorts through CPRD GOLD.  For the PCI cohort we will compare aspirin and clopidogrel (AC, reference) vs. aspirin and prasugrel (AP) or aspirin and ticagrelor (AT).  For the CABG and ACS cohorts we will compare aspirin (reference) vs. AC.  (For all three cohorts we will also compare AC, AP or AT (reference) vs. triple therapy, TT).  The primary outcome will be any bleeding event.  Secondary outcomes will be all-cause mortality; cardiovascular mortality; mortality from bleeding; hospital admission.
Data analysis: We will calculate crude and adjusted rates of bleeding (events/person time) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each exposure group and use Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for time to first bleeding event.","Primary: any bleeding event (classified as minor or major using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) bleeding scale). For each patient we will define all bleeding events in HES and CPRD (and cross-validate hospital admissions in HES) during follow-up.

Although rare, SJS and TEN have a significant clinical impact as they often result in either death (10-20% of cases) or a serious non-fatal complication. Furthermore, the fact they are primarily caused by several commonly prescribed medications has an impact on the behaviour of clinicians who have reason to prescribe these (e.g. allopurinol for gout, a common rheumatology condition). A limited number of studies have been conducted to date. This project will use data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to provide data on a representative sample of SJS/TEN patients across the United Kingdom to serve two important purposes. First, establish what percentage of SJS/TEN cases result following prescriptions of drugs previously known to be associated with the condition. Second, to investigate which patients are most likely to develop SJS/TEN following a prescription for a relevant drug. The results of this study will be helpful for the future management of patients requiring the aforementioned medications and who may be susceptible to developing SJS/TEN.","We will use data from the CPRD to answer the following questions: a. What is the risk of SJS/TEN for allopurinol, anti-epileptic, NSAID and anti-bacterial drug exposure compared with the general population and to explore the length of time between the drug exposure and diagnosis of SJS/TEN? (Case-control analysis) b. Among SJS/TEN cases, is the short-term mortality influenced by the drug (allopurinol, anti-epileptic, NSAID and anti-bacterial) which induced the reaction after adjusting for covariates? (Survival analysis) c. Develop and internally validate a prognostic model to establish factors which predict SJS/TEN following drug administration. (Risk prediction model) Cases will comprise people with a diagnosis of either SJS or TEN in their primary/secondary care record and each will be matched to 6 controls based on age, sex and practice.

It is caused by loss of brain cells which produce a neurotransmitter called dopamine. The reason these cells are damaged is not fully understood. One factor that may be involved is an overactive immune response. We aim to investigate whether drugs which suppress the immune system reduce risk of developing PD. To do this, we will look at historical information stored in CPRD about individuals who have ever taken strong immunosuppressant drugs for other conditions (e.g. Rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease) and determine how many of these individuals go on to develop PD. These individuals are likely to differ from the general population in terms of characteristics such as age and general health, which may complicate any apparent relationship between immunosuppressant drug use and PD risk. We will therefore describe these characteristics in detail, and use this information to design a second phase of the study to compare PD risk in those exposed to immunosuppressant drugs versus those who have never taken these drugs but are otherwise well-matched.  This work is important because it may pave the way for immunosuppressant therapies to slow the development of PD.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which affects movement and walking as well as cognition, leading to considerable disability. The underlying pathology involves deposition of alpha-synuclein aggregates within the brain and neuronal loss, particularly within dopaminergic networks. However, immune activation is also well described in PD, both in the brain and the periphery, and may contribute to disease initiation and progression. Hence we will investigate whether immunomodulatory drugs alter PD risk, a question which has important implications for the use of such drugs as novel disease-modifying agents to slow disease progression. However there are challenges in addressing this question using epidemiological data, as both exposure to these drugs and the outcome of PD are relatively rare, and those on immunosuppressive therapy will have significant comorbidity which may be a confounding factor. The first phase of this work will therefore involve a descriptive study of the demographic and clinical characteristics of all cases within the CPRD database exposed to immunosuppressive drugs, as well as PD incidence in this cohort. We will use the data to determine the feasibility of a comparative cohort study and subsequently identify an appropriate control cohort and relevant confounding factors for this comparative study.",Incident diagnosis of Parkinson's disease occurring at least 6 months (180 days) after the first prescription of immunosuppressive therapy.,"Dr Caroline Williams-Gray - Chief Investigator - University of Cambridge

Pylori infection. Gastric ulceration, H. Pylori infection and gastro-oesophageal reflux are risk factors for the development of upper gastric bleeding and malignancy. Although these drugs are so commonly used, and often for many years, there have been no long-term clinical trials investigating the relative efficacy of these drugs. In the UK the primary choice of PPI by GP prescribers has changed at various times and has been dictated by local guidelines related to cost rather than characteristics of the patients which may act as confounders between exposure and outcome. Therefore this relative lack of confounding by patient characteristics provides an excellent opportunity to compare the outcomes of people using these medications in real clinical practice.","The overall objective of this study is to compare the rates of upper gastrointestinal bleed and malignancy among users of lansoprazole and omeprazole. New users of each drug will be selected from CPRD and in the primary analysis, outcomes recorded in the CPRD using Read codes will be identified.

1) Duplication of effort. We will create freely available computer software to automate a number of key commonly used and time-consuming data processes, thereby speeding up processing time and reducing project time-scales and costs. 
2) Validity and replicability. In research using Primary Care Databases (PCDs) many key factors, such as the disease conditions a patient has and the treatments they are receiving, are defined using lists of relevant clinical codes, but very little detail about these lists is published and each research group develops their own lists. We aim to increase consistency in how clinical code lists are developed and used across the research community. 
3) Data quality. PCD-based research is relatively new and there are a number of issues around incorrect and missing data that still need to be addressed. Methods will be developed to deal with this issue.","Routinely collected electronic medical record (EMR) databases are rich sources of data for health research. Although lacking the rigour of Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) and potentially affected by bias from uncontrolled factors, these databases allow the investigation of research questions which may not be feasible to address by other means. The UK leads the world in Primary Care Databases (PCDs), which collate data from the electronic records of patients registered with large numbers of general practices, benefitting from the almost complete computerisation of UK primary care. Publications using PCDs and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in particular attract global research interest and applications are becoming more sophisticated, and the demands made on the data greater, as the field develops. This work focuses on three problematic or under-developed aspects of PCD-based research studies: a) reducing duplication of effort; b) increasing validity and reproducibility; c) improving analysis methodologies. To address these issues we will develop and maintain an online repository and also develop methods and software to perform power calculations, extract data and impute missing data.

Then, we will look at what type of patient is put on insulin glargine. Insulin glargine is a long-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin glargine works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar. The purpose of this study is to understand the number and type of patient treated with insulin. It is important to understand this so we can better understand and meet the medical needs of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients on insulin.","The objective of the study is to describe prescription patterns of insulin, the characteristics of patients initiating insulin glargine in real-world clinical practices and potential factors associated with the initiation of insulin glargine.

Bilirubin is created when the body breaks down old red blood cells. There are two types of CNS. CNS type 1 (CNS1) is the more severe condition, resulting in extremely high levels of bilirubin in the blood, which if left untreated may result in deafness, brain damage and death. CNS1 can be controlled by regular treatment with intense beams of light (phototherapy) to break down the bilirubin, but the patient will eventually require a liver transplant. CNS type 2 (CNS2) is associated with lower levels of bilirubin and is therefore less severe; it can be treated with phenobarbital. In this study, we wish to use data from general practice and hospital sources within CPRD to study patients with CNS and to describe them in terms of their age at diagnosis, gender, the effects of their disease, how it is monitored and treated, and rates of liver transplant and death.","We aim to define a cohort of patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome (CNS) and create patient profiles of relevant characteristics to determine, firstly, CNS type (CNS1 or CNS2) and, secondly, to follow the natural history of the condition.

Effective asthma management requires a proactive, preventative approach. Routine follow-up visits for patients with active asthma are recommended, at a frequency of every one to six months, depending upon the severity of asthma. There exist a number of combination products containing a long-acting reliever to relieve ongoing symptoms, such as breathlessness and a tight chest, and a corticosteroid preventer which helps prevent inflammation in the airways over the long term. These treatments have been shown in previous studies to be similarly effective in treating asthma symptoms and preventing inflammation. This study aims to determine whether the number of asthma-related GP visits, number of hospitalisations and the amount of usage of other respiratory medications differs between these treatments. The findings will help to determine which of these treatments has the lower impact on the healthcare system.","The objective of this study is to compare healthcare utilisation between patients with asthma who switched from Seretide Evohaler to flutiform versus those who switched from Seretide Evohaler to Fostair in both the primary healthcare setting, and the secondary care setting.

The CPRD will be used for comparisons in primary care, looking at the number of asthma-related GP visits pre- and post-switch for both treatment arms, as well as the number of prescriptions for short-acting beta agonists (SABA), oral steroids and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data will be used for comparisons in secondary care, looking at the number of asthma-related hospitalisations pre- and post-switch for both treatment arms. In addition, the factors described above will be stratified by the dose from which patients switched, and the dose to which they switched (where sufficient patients exist).","Outcomes of interest captured in the primary care setting will include: Number/average number of prescriptions of SABA usage, Number/average number of prescriptions of oral steroid usage, Number/average number of prescriptions of ICS usage, Number/average number of asthma-related GP visits.

There is, however, the potential for shorter prescriptions to increase costs through increased GP workload and dispensing fees. Currently, the consequences of longer and shorter prescriptions for patients with chronic diseases are unknown and need to be assessed. The purpose of this study is to determine if there are differences in the costs related to drug wastage, dispensing fees and prescriber time as a result of early refills and treatment switches for prescriptions issued as either a 28-day or 3-month supply in five selected case study scenarios representing common chronic conditions. This study will provide important information to the Department of Health in understanding the impact that encouraging GPs to issue shorter supplies of drugs has had on drug expenditure and drug wastage and additionally, help inform future prescribing policies.","The aim of this study is to estimate the differences in the costs of drug wastage, dispensing fees and prescriber time as a result of early refills and treatment switches in patients receiving medications as either 28-day or 3-month supplies for a number of common chronic diseases. A retrospective cohort analysis will be conducted using data from a random sample of 50,000 patients for five case study conditions derived from all adult patients receiving at least one prescription relevant to the respective condition during the 10-year period between 2004 and 2014. The volume of wastage from early refills and treatment switches (defined as a repeat prescription or new prescription for a drug commonly prescribed for the same condition being issued prior to the expiry of the previously prescribed quantity) will be estimated. Unit costs from standard sources will be applied to estimate the cost of wastage and dispensing for a common price year. The cost of health professional time to issue the prescription will also be added. Changes in drug wastage and dispensing fees will then be estimated had all prescriptions been for 28 days rather than the observed length.","The five case study conditions are:

Despite its importance the role of pancreatic therapy on longer-term health outcomes is has not been well studied.

This study will examine the characteristics of patients who receive pancreatin within 
disease subgroups compared to those who do not.  The main aim of the study is to determine whether pancreatin therapy has any influence on overall survival among patients within relevant disease subgroups.  The findings of the study will help health professionals prioritise pancreatin therapy in patients who may require it.","The proposed research will study the pharmacoepidemiology and long-term outcomes associated with Creon pancreatin use in subgroups of patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) due to aetiologies other than cystic fibrosis and diabetes.  Within these subgroups we aim to compare the outcomes of Creon pancreatin-treated cases with non-pancreatin-treated matched controls.

Previous evidence has shown that by subtyping type-2 Diabetes into groups of patients, the different groups may have different risk factors, complications and outcomes to treatments. By targeting treatments to a group of patients we can potentially offer more personalised care whereby different groups are treated differently to have better outcomes. 

In order to identify what makes up different groups of patients diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes we can use patient information collected from Electronic Health Records (EHR's) in the form of CALIBER. CALIBER is a programme which includes EHR's from GP surgeries (CPRD), Hospitals (HES), a database registry on heart attacks (MINAP) and the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The different sources of information are linked to produce CALIBER. 

By applying mathematical patterns to EHR's it is then possible to identify similar patients who have similar patterns of disease and group them together. The groups of patients are analysed for what makes them different including differences in long term health outcomes, complications and blood tests. Treatments can then be tailored to improve the long term health outcomes of groups and reduce their specific complications.","Precision medicine is a new branch of treatment that considers the variability in genetics and clinicopathological architecture of a disease when considering the clinical management of different patients. One recent study utilised a data driven approach using Electronic Health Records (EHR's) to understand Type-2 Diabetes by identifying distinct clusters of patients. Each cluster was characterised by different clinicopathological phenotypes as well as a distinct genetic architecture. 

This project proposes a similar analysis using unsupervised topological analysis on the CALIBER dataset (CArdiovascular research using Linked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records), a research platform of linked EHR's and administrative data providing rich data on comorbidities and treatments, a large number of clinical variables for cluster analysis and a large sample size of patients. 
 
The identified clusters can then be compared for their clinical and demographic characteristics and visualised using topology. Multinomial logistic regression is used to identify which clinical variables are most important in determining clusters and cox regression to identify possible differences between clusters for prognosis and long term outcomes such as cardiovascular disease.  This would demonstrate a clearer understanding and better management of different groups of patients diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes in the UK.","The outcome for objective one will be the identified clusters and their group membership.
Subsequent outcomes to be compared include mortality and complications associated with Type-2 Diabetes (including kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy microvascular complications and macrovascular complications).

To prevent recurrence of these blood clots in patients who survive, a medication called warfarin has been used for more than 50 years. The use of warfarin is complicated by the need for frequent blood tests to make sure that the concentration of warfarin in the blood is sufficient to prevent clots but not too high which may result in serious bleeding.  This limitation has led to the development of another class of drugs, the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which do not require monitoring by blood tests.  
Despite the potential benefits of DOAC therapy in the treatment of VTE, our knowledge regarding its safety is limited compared to warfarin. The purpose of this study is to determine whether DOACs are associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, such as stroke from bleeding in the brain or bleeding from the stomach or bowel, as compared to warfarin.","The objective of this study is to assess the safety of DOACs for the treatment of VTE using real-world, population-based data sources to inform policy development and clinical practice. We will conduct a matched cohort study to assess the safety of DOACs compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) such as warfarin among patients with incident VTE. The investigators will carry out separate population based cohort studies using administrative health databases in Canada, the United States (US), and the United Kingdom (UK). VKA-users will be matched to DOAC-users based on age, sex, date of cohort entry and propensity score. To determine the adjusted hazard of study outcomes with DOACs use (compared with VKA), we will perform multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

They are used to treat inflammation and ulcers in the stomach and parts of the gut and to reduce acid reflux which may cause heartburn or inflammation of the gullet. For most of these conditions treatment with PPIs is recommended for 2-8 weeks; however, in clinical practice they are often prescribed for a longer period of time. This may, however, pose a problem as long-term PPI use has been associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, the development of infections of the lung, and - most recently - with the development of dementia. While a number of studies have already investigated the risk of the first two conditions, evidence linking long-term PPI use with dementia is weak. We therefore plan to examine the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (the most common type of dementia) or vascular dementia (the second most common type of dementia) in association with PPI use. This is important, as, due to lack of effective treatment options for dementia, the focus lies on the prevention of this disease, and thus on avoidable risk factors.","The aim of this study is to explore the association between proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia (VaD). We propose a case-control analysis using CPRD data between January 1998 and December 2015.

We will quantify relative risk estimates (calculated as odds ratios) of developing AD or VaD in relation to duration and timing of previous PPI use (as the main exposure of interest). We will also analyse previous use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), another group of acid-reducing drugs, as an indirect comparator. We will apply multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.","Duration of PPI/H2RA use

Symptoms usually start in the teens/twenties. A form of arthritis, this disease causes inflammation in the spinal joints (or vertebrae), and may also affect other joints. In the more advanced cases, the inflammation may cause new bone formation where sections/joints of the spine fuse together. The symptoms of AS vary, but most people experience back pain and stiffness in the early stages of the disease. 

The estimated delay between symptom onset and diagnosis of AS is approximately 7-12 years. The existence of common symptoms (such as back pain) and the absence of remarkable physical findings contribute to its under and delayed diagnosis(Fallahi & Jamshidi, 2016). This in turn leads to a social, economic, physical and psychological burden on patients and the healthcare system. Because electronic health records (EHRs) include a sequence of measurements (clinical visits) over a period of time, they contain important information about the progression of disease, which can be particularly useful for uncovering patterns in challenging and poorly diagnosed disorders such as AS.

The aim of this project is to aid in an early diagnosis of AS by analysing real world evidence data to identify early indicators of the disease. Determining patterns across medical features (signs, symptoms, outpatient and emergency visits, procedures, referrals, tests) and utilizing those patterns to enable decision making (i.e. a more rapid specialist referral by the GP) at an early stage of the disease, may prove highly beneficial for AS management in the future.","Objectives:
Although ~200,000 people in the UK have Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a spinal inflammatory disease, it is an underdiagnosed condition(Dean et al., 2014). Symptoms usually start in the teens/twenties but it can take ~10 years for patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. This is due to a number of factors such as the existence of symptoms, which have a broad prevalence in the general population (like back pain), a gradual onset of the disease and the lack of unique biomarkers and clear guidelines for rheumatology referrals. Delayed diagnosis is a major impediment to treatment, disease characterization, policy-making, and resource allocation. This may be overcome by the analysis of electronic health records via predictive modelling. 

Building predictive models may be particularly useful to assimilate vast information and detect patterns across patient health records in order to provide valuable insight into disease management. We will use the CPRD, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) data to identify predictors among the AS patient population that differentiate them from a non-AS control population. HES and ONS data will be used in conjunction with CPRD to gather insights into the diagnostic journey of AS patients by analysing patterns in hospitalisations, outpatient consultations, referrals, clinical procedures performed, accident and emergency visits, cause of death and treatment specialty. 

Methods:
Machine learning will be used to capture features and patterns in patient characteristics that differentiate AS patients from controls across the database, and then predict an AS diagnosis, based on these features. Accuracy, precision, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves will be computed for the trained and tested models. 

Data analysis:
Patients recorded with a diagnosis of AS from 01/01/2005 to 31/12/2018 will be the cohort analysed in this study.","The outcome of interest in this analysis is a likelihood/probability estimation of an AS diagnosis in a patient based on patterns determined via predictive modelling.

Using such data, we aim to answer the following three research questions: 
1) What are the features and characteristics of the symptoms and complications of seasonal flu and Covid19 infections, with a particular focus on pneumoniae? 
2) What are the predictors of adverse outcomes amongst patients with flu- or Covid19-related hospitalization? And can we, by combining them, generate algorithms that can help us identify subjects most at risk of complications and/or morbi-mortality?

Improving end-of-life care for these individuals, and supporting people to remain in community settings, are national priorities. Emergency hospital admissions by people with dementia in their last months of life is an indicator of potentially overaggressive care. We know that certain characteristics predict emergency admissions among people with dementia close to death. For example, having multiple chronic illnesses or being male were associated with more Emergency Department attendance in the last months of life, while living in a care home is associated with lower use of acute hospital services. However, less is known about how primary care services influence emergency admissions near the end-of-life in England.
This project aims to understand how primary care services (such as the number of contacts with General Practitioners and nurses at the GP practice, and continuity of care) influence emergency admissions for people with dementia in the last 90 days of life. Understanding which individuals and healthcare services are associated with hospital admissions near the end of life could help to develop and improve primary care services and reduce reliance on emergency hospital care for individuals with dementia.","Background: The number of people dying with dementia in England is projected to increase x3 by 2040. Hospital admissions at the end-of-life can be deleterious and are potentially avoidable. Continuity of care with a GP and number of GP visits have been associated with lower hospital admissions in individuals with cancer. However the impact of primary care services on end-of-life hospitalizations for individuals with dementia is unknown.
Aim: To understand primary care service use among individuals with dementia in the last year of life, and its association with multiple emergency hospital admissions in last 90 days of life.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study using CPRD dataset linked to HES and ONS data. Individuals with dementia who died between 2009-2019 will be included. The primary outcome is multiple emergency admissions to hospital in the last 90 days of life, an established Quality Indicator for dementia care. The number of face-to-face, telephone and home visit contacts with GP and nurses at the practice, as well as the Continuity of Care index, will be extracted from CPRD. Demographics variables (age, gender, marital status and socioeconomic position), illness-related variables (comorbidities, frailty index) and environmental variables (rate of nursing and care homes beds in CCG) will be included as covariables. A multilevel logistic regression will be used to explore association between primary care contacts and multiple hospital admissions in the last 90 days of life.","The primary outcome will be multiple emergency admissions to hospital in the last 90 days of life, defined as either more than two emergency hospitalizations for any reason or more than one hospitalization for pneumonia, urinary tract infection, dehydration or sepsis in the last 90 days of life.

Whooping cough is believed to be a childhood disease; however, adults can also be affected, although their symptoms are thought to be less severe. Among older adults (those >/=50 years), particularly those with chronic conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, there is little information on the number of people pertussis affects, or its impact on their health. Potential severe complications among these populations could lead to hospitalisation, with significant health impact on patients and economic impacts to healthcare systems. In the UK, whooping cough in older adults may not be well measured and is thought to be often underestimated.

The aims of this study are therefore to assess: (1) the characteristics of older adults in the UK who are more likely to be diagnosed with whooping cough, (2) the number of older adults in the UK affected by the disease during the decade 2009-2018, and (3) the impact of the disease for the UK healthcare system in terms of increased resource use and costs.","Pertussis (whooping cough), a highly contagious disease caused by Bordetella pertussis, affects the respiratory system (McGuinness et al., 2013). Among older adults (those >/=50 years) and particularly those with comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, there is scarce information on the incidence of pertussis, or its associated clinical and economic burden. Prior evidence suggests that potential complications among these populations could lead to hospitalisation (Buck et al., 2017; Capili et al., 2012; Pesek & Lockey, 2011). Overall, the clinical and economic burden of pertussis in older adults in the UK is considerably underestimated and not well-characterised (Caro et al.,2005; Masseria & Krishnarajah, 2015). 

This primarily descriptive study plans to identify risk factors for pertussis among older adults (>/=50 years), and to estimate the incidence of pertussis overall in the general UK population of older adults, as well as among additional cohorts identified as being at high risk of pertussis (those with comorbid COPD, asthma, or heart failure), over a 10-year period from 2009 to 2018. Incidence rates will be stratified by age groups and by calendar year. A matched case-control study design will be used to assess risk factors for pertussis and the associated economic burden. Resource use in the primary and secondary care setting, estimated as the rate of events per patient per year accounting for differential follow-up, and associated costs per patient per year will be estimated for older adults with pertussis versus controls without pertussis. The analyses will be conducted among the overall cohort of older adults and the known high-risk cohorts (COPD, asthma, and heart failure), as well as any other newly identified high-risk cohorts.","1.

Because it is a new disease, we do not know how underlying health conditions affect the risk of catching COVID-19. 

Public Health England has collected information about the first few hundred COVID-19 cases in England using questionnaires, including pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes. This study will compare the presence of these health conditions among patients with COVID-19 to the general population, adjusting for differences in age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and region. This will help us to understand better which health conditions may increase the risk of infection among the general population. Patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to intensive care with pneumonia will also be compared to people admitted to intensive case with pneumonia at the same time last year. This will help understand whether the risk factors for severe COVID-19 pneumonia are different from those for severe pneumonia from other causes. Finally, we will describe how common each risk factor is in the general population, according to age, sex and region, so that our results can be used to predict health service use.

This work is part of the Health Protection Research Unit in Immunisation, a partnership between the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Public Health England. The findings will inform Public Health England's policy advice to the government, advice for people with underlying health conditions, and planning for the demand on health services during the COVID-19 pandemic.","This study will describe associations between underlying health conditions and early COVID-19 infections in England, compare the profile of underlying health conditions among COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ITU admission to those for severe pneumonia of other causes, and describe the prevalence of these conditions among the general population in England.

For the first two aims, a case-control study design will be used, with two control groups. Cases will comprise the 'first few hundred' COVID-19 cases in England, January-March 2020, using a depersonalised dataset from Public Health England. 

For the main analysis, controls will be the general population active in CPRD, January-March 2019. Potential risk factors will be chronic heart, respiratory, kidney, neurological and liver diseases, immunosuppression, asthma requiring medication, malignancy, organ transplant recipients, pregnancy and smoking status. A secondary analysis we will compare COVID-19 cases admitted to ITU with pneumonia to controls admitted to ITU with pneumonia in January - March 2019. Both analyses will use multivariable logistic regression to calculate odds ratios adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, region and deprivation.

Among individuals eligible to be selected as general population controls, summary data of the prevalence of the underlying health conditions stratified by age, sex and region will be described to enable findings to be used in modelling to inform policy responses to COVID-19. 

The results will inform planning for the demand on health services during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Public Health England's advice to the public and government about the risk of COVID-19 for people with underlying health conditions.","Primary: Laboratory-confirmed infection with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - indicated by inclusion in Public Health England COVID-19 'first few hundred' case dataset.

The blood clot then clogs a blood vessel and thereby causes a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or the blood clot travels to the lung and causes a pulmonary embolism (PE). The term VTE therefore includes both DVT and PE. VTE is a dangerous, potentially fatal condition. Its prevention and management is of high priority for the National Health Service (NHS). 
Diabetes mellitus (DM), a disease characterised by high levels of blood sugar over a prolonged period, affects over 450 million patients worldwide (8.8%). Both variants of the disease, DM type 1 and 2, are suspected to be a risk factor for VTE, as it has been observed that VTE occurs more often in individuals with DM. However, to date, few studies have assessed the impact of blood sugar control on the risk of VTE in patients with DM. Additionally, available studies on the topic yielded conflicting results. While some studies found an association between the level of blood sugar control and the risk of VTE, others did not.
Our objective is therefore to explore the association between the level of blood sugar control and the risk of VTE in patients with DM type 1 and 2.","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a medical condition in which a blood clot (a thrombus) forms in a vein of the leg or pelvis, and either causes a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or the thrombus travels to the pulmonary arteries and causes a pulmonary embolism (PE). The term VTE therefore includes DVT and PE. VTE is a dangerous condition and an important cause of death. Its prevention and management is a priority for the National Health Service (NHS). 
Since diabetes type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) affect over 450 million patients worldwide (8.8%), diabetes and its related complications are of great importance for society and the health system. 
DM is suspected to be a risk factor for VTE as VTE occurs more often in individuals with DM. However, to date, few studies have assessed the impact of blood sugar control (measured as HbA1c levels) on the risk of VTE in patients with DM types 1 and 2. Additionally, available studies on the topic yielded conflicting results. While some studies found an association between the HbA1c level and the risk of VTE, others did not.

Cardiovascular disease (problems with the heart and circulatory system) is a common problem experienced by people with type 2 diabetes. There are many different types of medications used in type 2 diabetes to help reduce blood sugar. Research suggests that some of these medications may reduce cardiovascular problems and death from cardiovascular causes. However, the extent to which these medications are being actively used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK, whether this is consistent throughout the UK, and which patients are more likely to receive these medications versus alternatives, is unclear. Our study aims to gain insight into current prescribing patterns for type 2 diabetes in the UK, with a focus on how this may differ by whether or not patients have a history of cardiovascular disease. We will use primary care data to summarise the types of type 2 diabetes medications being currently and newly prescribed, looking separately by history of cardiovascular disease and by UK geographical region. Further, to investigate whether other factors might be associated with the decision to prescribe a particular drug type, we will compare other patient characteristics (such as age, ethnicity, and lifestyle factors) between patients starting different types of diabetes medications at different treatment stages. The results of this study will provide important information that may aid decision making and improve care for people with type 2 diabetes.","Recent studies suggest that selected diabetes treatments (namely sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) and glucagon-like peptide 1-receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs)) have significant cardio-protective benefits. A recent estimate of the UK prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) within type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is 35%; but the treatment patterns of these patients remains unclear. In particular, the extent to and stage at which SLGT2 inhibitors and GLP1-RAs are used across the UK, and how usage differs from those without CVD is unknown. With a shift to looking beyond glycaemic control to manage diabetes and its complications, it is important to understand the current treatment patterns of these patients; what clinical and demographic characteristics may be associated with class choice at point of intensification; and how this compares to recent ADA/EASD recommendations. This study therefore aims to: 

 - Describe prescribing variation by class in patients with T2DM by history of CVD; by UK geographical region; and by calendar year since 2017.
 - Describe and compare characteristics of those initiating different classes of medication within the past 3 years by CVD history and intensification stage. 

The study will use primary care data to establish a cohort of patients with T2DM, from which we will use cross sectional sub-populations to estimate prevalence of class use through time. From the same underlying cohort, a sub-cohort of initiators will be used for comparisons of patient characteristics. 

The main outcomes (prescription for/ initiation of a particular class of T2DM medication) will be ascertained using prescription data.  The main exposure (CVD history) will be ascertained using clinical diagnoses in the primary care record. Prevalence by time, CVD history and treatment stage will be presented descriptively, with exact 95% confidence intervals for proportions to quantify uncertainty.

This study will develop new mathematical predictive models for selection of people for LDCT screening based on primary care data and compare these with existing models and recommendations. If better models are developed, the identification of individuals who will benefit most from screening, and of those unlikely to benefit, will improve, increasing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the programs likely to be approved in the UK and Europe soon. This approach maximises benefit by using electronic primary care datasets available in the UK, but it is likely that the principles will be transferrable to other countries where electronic healthcare data are available. In particular, the value of adding information on symptoms will be clarified and could lead to improved selection models that can be used in other countries. The ultimate aim will be to develop a model that can be used to create a primary care-based tool embedded in primary care systems that accurately selects patients eligible for CT screening for lung cancer, and provides an opportunity for primary care based invitation.","Objectives:
The overall aim of this project is to determine if primary care data can be used to develop improved risk prediction models for selecting individuals for low dose CT screening for lung cancer? Specific research objectives are:
1.	To develop a series of mathematical models using data from patients one, two and three years prior to lung cancer diagnosis. 
2.	To examine for differences between models, including analysis of variation when stratifying lung cancer into early and late stage, pathological subtype and by route to diagnosis. 
3.	To compare the predictive performance in the external validation datasets and the eligibility rates between the new model(s), the PLCOM2012 and the LLPv2 models over a range of risk thresholds.
4.	To assess the cost effectiveness of the models at varying risk thresholds. 

Methods and data analysis:
a.	A longitudinal cohort will be determined using CPRD with patients identified between 01/01/2000 until 31/12/2015 who have been contributing to CRPD for at least 12 months after their first registration. All cases with at least one Read code for lung cancer in CPRD who have research quality data will be included and the whole of CPRD with no diagnosis of lung cancer aged 40 years or older will be the comparator group (Sections K and L). 
b.	Patient demographic features, all symptoms, diagnoses, investigations and drug prescriptions will be classified and used to produce a risk prediction model.
c.	This model will be externally validated and cost effectiveness analysis will be performed using microsimulation modelling. 
d.	The best performing pre-existing models will be externally validated in the CPRD cohort (namely the Liverpool Lung Project Version 2 - LLPv2 and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer model (PLCOm2012).","Discrimination of the models (AUC)

Patients with AF are at high risk of having strokes. Blood thinners such as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are effective for stroke prevention. However, their benefit comes with an increased risk of bleeding. The clinical trials that studied the effects of DOACs in patients with AF excluded patients with liver disease. However, liver disease can increase the risk of stroke as well as the risk of bleeding. In addition, liver disease can affect the pharmacology of DOACs. Thus, the aim of our study is to describe how these drugs are used, their effectiveness for stroke prevention, and their safety with respect to bleeding in patients with both AF and liver disease. To this end, we will first describe the patterns of prescription of DOACs in these patients from 2011 to 2019. Then, we will compare the occurrence of stroke, bleeding, and death between DOACs and VKAs during the same time period. Finally, we will compare the rates of stroke, bleeding, and death between apixaban and rivaroxaban, which are two commonly used DOACs.","Patients with liver disease were systematically excluded from the randomized trials assessing the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). However, liver disease can modify the pharmacology of DOACs, and it can also increase both the thrombotic and the bleeding risk of NVAF patients, which complicates anticoagulant treatment in this vulnerable population. To date, observational studies assessing the effectiveness and safety of DOACs in NVAF patients with concomitant liver disease have been scarce. Moreover, they had methodological limitations rendering the interpretation of their results difficult. Of note, no studies have compared head-to-head apixaban versus rivaroxaban, the two DOACs most commonly used for stroke prevention in NVAF. Thus, the objective of this study will be to assess the utilisation, effectiveness, and safety of DOACs in NVAF patients with liver disease, while also comparing apixaban versus rivaroxaban in the same population. To this end, we will first describe the utilisation of DOACs in NVAF patients with liver disease between 2011 (the year DOACs were approved for stroke prevention in NVAF in the United Kingdom) and 2019 by characterising the groups of patients who initiate DOACs versus the therapeutic alternative vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), characterising the groups of patients who switch from VKAs to DOACs versus remaining on VKAs, and assessing long-term treatment persistence of DOACs versus VKAs. Then, we will use time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model to estimate confounder-adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the association between the risk of ischaemic stroke, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality and current use of DOACs compared with current use of VKAs (or current use of apixaban compared with current use of rivaroxaban) in NVAF patients with liver disease.

Asthma is one of the most common childhood diseases worldwide, with approximately 5.4 million patients receiving treatment for asthma in the UK alone. Recently there has been growing interest surrounding the factors that might predispose a patient to developing asthma. Disruption of the normal gut bacteria through the use of antibiotics has been suggested as a factor that might have a role.

This study will investigate whether there is an association between the use of amoxicillin during a child's first year of life and development of asthma in later childhood. It will examine differences in the risk of asthma depending on frequency of exposure to amoxicillin during infancy, and it will also determine the average time between the initial exposure to amoxicillin and diagnosis of asthma.

Results of this study will add to scientific understanding of the role of the normal bacteria in diseases such as asthma.","This retrospective cohort study will examine the risk of asthma amongst children exposed to amoxicillin between the ages 0 and 11 months (""infancy""), inclusive.

Many women experience hot flushes, night sweats and related symptoms, collectively known as vasomotor symptoms (VMS), which have been reported to persist for a number of years after a woman's final menstrual period.

Symptom relief is at the centre of menopause management with the most common VMS treatment in the United Kingdom considered to be hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

Whilst HRT is effective in managing symptoms for many women, for some it has been reported to increase the chances of stroke, breast cancer and coronary heart disease (nonfatal myocardial infarction). Therefore, HRT may not always be the appropriate choice for managing VMS. 

Where HRT is not an option for women with VMS, for example if they are already at high risk of cardiovascular disease, or if they are taking other medication that may prohibit HRT use, alternative options may be presented, such as anti-depressive medication, over the counter therapies, herbal remedies, diet and lifestyle changes. There has been little reported success in overall symptom alleviation with alternative therapies.

The aim of this study is to understand the real world treatment landscape of women with VMS. We will describe the proportion of women of menopausal age (40-65 years) who have been diagnosed with VMS in the last ten years, and report treatments prescribed for VMS patients (in their first year after being diagnosed, and also over their course of their patient history in the study). We will also look to understand how often women use resources in primary care and secondary care for VMS related events.","Women of menopausal age, typically 40-65 years, can experience hot flushes, night sweats and related symptoms, collectively known as vasomotor symptoms (VMS). These symptoms have been reported to persist for a median of 4.5years after a woman's final menstrual period [Avis et al, 2015]. Whilst hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are commonly prescribed for symptomatic relief, HRT may not always be the appropriate choice, due to contraindications or high-risk of treatment related adverse events such as stroke, breast cancer and coronary heart disease (nonfatal myocardial infarction)].  

There has been limited reporting of the real world treatment landscape for women with VMS, which is needed for foundational insight on the management of VMS. 

This study aims to describe the incidence, prevalence, treatment patterns and health care resource use of women with VMS. This is a descriptive study using the most recent 10 years of linked electronic medical records from the UK (Gold). 

VMS cases will be captured using Read code diagnosis, and will be described in terms of their patient characteristics and a-priori selected comorbidities. The annual incidence rate of VMS among the general population of woman of menopausal age will be estimated, along with annual point prevalence of VMS. For incident cases, the first line treatment received (hormonal, non-hormonal, no treatment) post VMS diagnosis will be reported, as well as subsequent treatment pattern in their patient history. The duration of first line treatment (persistence) will be described, along with a proxy measure for treatment adherence (medication possession ratio).

It is caused by an increased amount of uric acid in the body. It affects around 1 in 40 people in the UK.  The build-up of uric acid can form needle-like crystals in a joint and cause sudden pain, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling, often in the big toe. It is also associated with a greater risk of heart and kidney disease, diabetes, cancer and sleep apnoea. Some patients are prescribed drugs to lower uric acid levels, called urate lowering therapy (ULT), along with certain diary restrictions. Verinurad is a novel drug that, in combination with other existing therapies can significantly reduce uric acid levels. High uric acid may also be associated with development of heart failure. It remains unclear whether lowering serum uric acid can lead to improved outcomes in patients with gout who have a history of heart failure. We plan to examine the health benefits of ULT in patients with gout and a history of heart failure.","Verinurad is a urate transporter 1 (URAT-1) inhibitor that, in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI), can lower serum uric acid (sUA) by 70-80%. The initial development program focused on gout, however, it is being repurposed for development in other indications. There is a strong association between elevated sUA and incidence of heart failure (HF), in particularly those with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).  It remains unclear whether lowering sUA can improve outcomes in heart failure patients. Around 35% of patients with gout are prescribed urate lowering therapy (ULT). Therefore, the aim of this investigation is to conduct comparative effectiveness analyses examining health outcomes among patients with gout and a history of heart failure who initiate therapy with ULT versus those who do not. 

Methods and analysis

We will include all patients >/=18 years old with a recorded diagnosis of gout and/or elevated serum urate level (serum urate level >6 mg/dl) during April 1, 1997 to June 31, 2019 who also have a history of heart failure. To better ascertain comorbidities and hospitalisation episodes, only those with linked secondary care data will be included.

In chronic conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) this is typically done using health economic models which combine data from various sources including routinely collected healthcare records. In COPD, information is required on disease severity and progression, risk of COPD exacerbations, death, health-related quality of life, and the use of healthcare services.

In this exploratory study we will explore the variation in disease severity (or lung function) in patients with COPD, the risk of COPD exacerbations (i.e. acute worsening of symptoms) by disease severity, and healthcare visits (e.g. to the GP) and medication use by both disease severity and exacerbations.","Health technology assessment (HTA) bodies (e.g. the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England) make recommendations about the use of healthcare technologies in the health care system based on their clinical and cost-effectiveness. This is often done using health economic decision models, which are populated with data from various sources including observational databases. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) information is required on disease severity and progression, risks of COPD exacerbations, death, health-related quality of life, and healthcare resource utilisation. 

We aim to use CPRD data to estimate some of these key parameters, namely the distribution of COPD patients by disease severity, rates of COPD exacerbations by disease severity, and healthcare utilisation and costs by both disease severity and history of exacerbations. 

We will estimate these parameters using CPRD (GOLD) data that will be mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. The common data model ensures that otherwise disparate datasets have the same structure and clinical coding languages (e.g. SNOMED for clinical terms and RxNorm for drugs). This increases the interoperability of data such that code developed on any one data set can be applied to others in the same format. This is important for HTA, because it allows parameters (e.g. healthcare costs) to be easily translated to different populations and settings.","- Lung function

These conditions include heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), painful periods (dysmenorrhea) and endometriosis, and are estimated to affect 25%, 20% and 10% of women of reproductive age, respectively.

Previous studies have highlighted concerns about how effectively menstrual disorders are managed and treated in primary care, but the number of patients seeking help from GPs for heavy and/or painful periods is not well understood and neither are their healthcare needs. 

In this project we will develop code lists to determine patients who go to their GP about heavy and/or painful periods. We will then calculate the incidence and prevalence of these conditions and describe how this varies by age, ethnicity and deprivation status. Finally, we will describe how often patients with menstrual disorders use the health service, which treatments they are getting and how many of them are referred to secondary care services.

It is important to know how many women are affected by menstrual disorders and understand the way in which they are using the NHS so that we can identify opportunities to improve access to existing treatments and highlight any disparities that exist in the care that they are given.","Objectives

This study aims to support GPs, gynaecologists and commissioners to understand the health service needs of patients with menstrual disorders and how these vary by clinical and socio-demographic factors.

This study will estimate the incidence and prevalence of common menstrual disorders among women of reproductive age and describe the use of primary and secondary health care by women with these conditions by age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation and time. 

Methods and data analysis

First, codelists (overall and by sub-condition) will be developed following best practice guidance,drawing on clinical expertise and previously published studies. This methodological work is not only an essential preparation for data analysis, but it will also guide recommendations on how diagnoses and procedures related to menstrual disorders can be better recorded into electronic databases in the future.

The finalised codelists will be applied to a random sample of 500,000 female patients (aged 8 to 60 years in 2013) with linked CPRD-HES records. This dataset will be used to:

 - Estimate the incidence and prevalence of menstrual disorders in CPRD in 2013, overall and by sub-condition
 - Describe the characteristics of patients who attend their GP with a menstrual disorder, by age; ethnic and deprivation profiles; type of menstrual disorder.
 - Describe the treatments these patients receive in primary care over a 5-year follow-up period (2014 to 2019) and how patterns of referral to secondary care services vary according to age, ethnicity, level of deprivation and type of menstrual disorder.
 - Describe and compare and levels of primary and secondary care utilisation (as captured in HES) over a 5-year follow-up period (2014 to 2019) between patients with and without a menstrual disorder.","Number of patients with a 'likely', 'probable' or 'possible' menstrual disorder

A large proportion of these childhood deaths in the UK are in children with known chronic conditions, with chronic neurological conditions, including epilepsy, being the most common.  A recent UK study of adults with epilepsy showed a higher rate of unnatural deaths such as suicide and poisoning compared to the general population. However, the mortality rate and causes of death in children (aged less than 19 years) with epilepsy is uncertain. Such information is needed to help guide policy and resource allocation for children with epilepsy to reduce the risk of premature death.  We propose to fill that knowledge gap with a data linkage study using data from general practice (GP) medical records, in-patient hospital admissions and mortality records (electronic health records, EHR) from England and Wales. All children born between 1998 and 2018 and registered with a GP in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) will be followed up through EHR to find out, if they have had a diagnosis of epilepsy; if they have died during follow-up to a maximum age of 20 years; and if so, what was the underlying cause for their death. The death rate in children with epilepsy and those without epilepsy will be determined and compared; we will take other characteristics that may affect the risk of death, such as socioeconomic status, into account when analysing study results.","Mortality rate and causes of death in children (aged less than 19 years) with epilepsy (CWE) in the UK is uncertain. Such information can help guide policy and resource allocation for CWE to reduce their risk of premature death.  

We propose to carry out a prospective, cohort study using the latest electronic primary care data set linked to hospitalization, mortality, and deprivations records available through the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We will determine an epilepsy (exposed) and comparison group (unexposed) from a subset of general practitioner practices whose anonymized patient-level data are linked to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality records, Index of Multiple Deprivation 2010, and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). These sources will provide information on date and cause of death (ONS), quintiles of deprivation based on patient postcodes (Index of Multiple Deprivation 2010), and inpatient hospitalizations (HES).

All children born between January 1, 1998 and January 14, 2018 will be included to ensure a follow-up period of at least one year.  We will follow-up children up to a maximum of age 20 years.  We will define epilepsy index date as the latest date at which someone received both an epilepsy diagnostic code and an associated AED prescription based on read diagnosis codes and prescription codes used in a previous validation study.  


Cause of death will be that provided from ONS data, and subclassified into epilepsy-related death, natural non-epilepsy related, unnatural death and unknown.  Risk of mortality (primary outcome) will be analysed using parametric and non-parametric survival analysis, adjusting for effects of sex, year of birth and deprivation. We will calculate mortality rate by dividing the number of events by the sum of person-years at risk.

Affected women are more likely to go on to get type 2 diabetes than women who have not have gestational diabetes. UK guidelines advise women to be tested for diabetes at six to 13 weeks after a gestational diabetes pregnancy, and once a year from then on. This helps doctors to diagnose and manage diabetes early so that mothers can stay healthier. However, lots of women do not get tested, and most do not go every year. Often they do not know that the tests are recommended, and are not invited or reminded to attend. 
In this study, we aim to understand patterns in diabetes screening after gestational diabetes. We will use clinical records, and we will not identify individual patients. We will describe how many women are screened, how long after pregnancy, which tests were used, and how many women are diagnosed with diabetes. We will also look at whether factors like the number of children someone has, which part of the UK they live in, and which general practice they attend affects likelihood screening.
This study will help us to understand current practices in medical care after gestational diabetes in the UK. This will help to inform changes to policy to improve treatment. We may find groups of women who do not go to screening or have a higher risk of diabetes, therefore need more support to attend testing.","Background
Gestational diabetes (GD) affects nearly a fifth of pregnancies in the UK, and puts mothers at an eight-fold higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than women with normal glucose tolerance in pregnancy. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that women are screened for diabetes at six to 13 weeks after pregnancy and then once a year thereafter to allow early diagnosis and management of incident diabetes. However, uptake is poor, particularly in the long term, and no large studies have reported screening rates after three years postpartum in the UK. 
Aims
We therefore aim to describe diabetes screening practices in UK primary care in the long term after GD. We will also determine whether attendance varies by maternal and practice characteristics, which types of screening tests are used, and report diagnoses of glucose intolerance disorders.
Method
We will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum dataset to discover patients with GD recorded in their medical record. CPRD Aurum contains deidentified patient data from GP practices in the UK that use the EMIS Web  software system.
Patient and practice characteristics and diabetes screening patterns will be summarised using descriptive statistics. We will describe coverage of diabetes testing by time since pregnancy according to variables including age, ethnicity, deprivation, and BMI at different time points. We will describe the types of test ordered and whether this was in line with the NICE guidelines at that time. Hazard ratios will be estimated with Cox regression models to examine the association between maternal characteristics and practice characteristics. In addition, survival analyses will be used to describe time since pregnancy to the last (most recent) test attended, and to diagnosis of diabetes or a glucose intolerance disorder. 
Data will be analysed using STATA version 15.1 and R (latest release).","Primary outcome: record of diabetes screening tests (using any test).

Health care accounts for a large and expanding share of public finances and has been growing ever since the NHS was first adopted. This trend is expected to continue over the coming decades in response to growing public expectations for more and better-quality healthcare, alongside a growing and ageing population. It is therefore crucial to understand how and why spending on health care has risen over time and how costs are likely to change in the future.

The aim of this study specifically is to produce statistics on the use of primary care. We will look at the number of primary care consultations per year from 2000 to 2018 broken down by age, gender, proximity to death, consultation type (e.g. face-to-face, home visit) and practice staff role.

In young children, over-prescription of antibiotics also poses additional risks during a critical time in the development of bacteria in the gut that can influence immune health, brain health, and ability to process nutrients. We will study how early exposure to antibiotics might help cause various chronic diseases to develop in children, including asthma, allergies, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, juvenile arthritis, celiac disease, attention disorders, depression, and autism. Children under age 12 who received antibiotics before age 2 will be compared with children who did not receive antibiotics before age 2. We will use specific codes to study children diagnosed with the diseases of interest. We will study whether risks of chronic diseases relate to what kinds of antibiotics and how many courses were prescribed. To account for information that is not present in the data but could affect our results, we will also study whether children who received antibiotics before age 2 are more likely to develop chronic diseases than siblings who did not receive antibiotics before age 2.","We will investigate the relationship between exposure to antibiotics before age 2 and incident chronic diseases linked to disruption of human microbiota, including conditions affecting the immune system, central nervous system (CNS), and metabolism. Antibiotic-exposed and -unexposed cohorts of children will be generated from CPRD data.  Children under age 12 will be considered in primary analysis, but additional groups under age 18 will be included in secondary analysis. The study population will include children in the linked mother-child CPRD dataset born after the up-to-standard date. Linkage of children to their mothers will allow us to adjust for prenatal antibiotic exposures, maternal medical conditions, and other confounding variables (e.g., mode of birth delivery). We will define antibiotic exposure as a prescription for antibiotics within the first 2 years of life, with further categorization by type, spectrum of activity, and number of courses prescribed. Outcomes of interest include allergic or atopic diseases (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy), autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroid disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, celiac disease), metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, obesity), and neuropsychiatric diseases (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, and learning disability). With the exception of obesity, we will define outcomes primarily by Read Codes and secondarily by Read Codes combined with disease-specific treatments. Obesity will be defined by a body mass index (BMI) Z-score >2 and secondarily by a BMI Z-score >3, based on UK growth standards. Wherever possible, we will use validated outcome definitions. Subjects with a diagnosis of interest prior to age 2 will be excluded from the study of that respective outcome. We will use multivariable Cox regression to study the association between antibiotic exposure and outcomes of interest, adjusting for maternal, child, and environmental confounders, including indication for antibiotic exposure.

Management is life-long, and can span decades, as onset typically occurs in adolescence or early adulthood. Lithium is an effective treatment, but is associated with kidney damage. There is a need for further studies to consider the natural course of bipolar disorder, lithium treatment, and kidney health; in particular, there is very little data examining the effect of stopping lithium on subsequent kidney function. We plan to quantitatively answer the following questions using routinely collected clinical data:

a) What is the natural course of chronic kidney disease for patients taking lithium? 

b) Does kidney function decline in relation to duration of lithium use, or its onset/offset?

c) Can lost kidney function be recovered after lithium withdrawal? 

Clinicians and patients require clear information to assess the risks and benefits of continued lithium treatment where kidney damage is present. Our data analyses will contribute to improving care and decision making for patients with bipolar disorder on lithium treatment.","Bipolar affective disorder (bipolar disorder, BD) is a severe psychiatric disorder affecting 1-3% of the general population. Management is life-long as onset typically occurs early in life. Lithium is an effective treatment, but is associated with kidney damage. Approximately 30% of patients taking lithium long-term will be diagnosed with early stage chronic kidney disease (CKD); 2-5% of patients will require dialysis, and 0.5% will experience end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Mcknight et al., 2012). Nephrologists currently advise patients to discontinue lithium when CKD stage 3 is reached (estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2). 

Lithium withdrawal studies are few and conflicting as to the extent and reversibility of glomerular kidney damage. Some data suggest that once CKD is established, eGFR further declines irrespective of lithium withdrawal (Bocchetta et al., 2015; Bendz et al., 2010). 

Case studies (Hajek, Alda, & Grof, 2011; Dehning et al., 2017) suggest withdrawal from lithium can result in unmanaged BD and loss of life from suicide. Switching to another mood stabiliser late in the disease course may not be an effective solution, since drug side effects and renal damage may persist or worsen (Werneke et al., 2012).

There is a need for further longitudinal studies to review renal function where patients have withdrawn from lithium treatment. Clinicians and patients require clear information to assess the risks and benefits of continued lithium treatment where renal impairment or failure is present.

Analytical plan. We will predict eGFR via classical and Bayesian statistical techniques, estimating the instantaneous effect of taking lithium on eGFR, the change in eGFR velocity attributable to being on lithium, and the effect on eGFR trajectory of lithium cessation (past but not current lithium use).

Impact. Our analyses will contribute to improving patient-centred care and decision making for patients with BD on life-long treatment.",Rate of change in eGFR over time for patients and control.,"Dr Rudolf Cardinal - Chief Investigator - University of Cambridge

All oral anticoagulants greatly reduce an individual's chances of experiencing a stroke, while increasing one's chances of having a serious bleeding complication.  Prior research suggests that difficulty weighing the risks and benefits of treatment may result in underutilization of oral anticoagulants: Less than one-half of patients at high risk of stroke receive oral anticoagulants.  Physicians identify patients who are most likely to benefit from using these medicines by using an individual's characteristics to estimate stroke risk without treatment and the risk of major bleeding with treatment.  However, the existing risk scoring systems have a number of limitations.  For example, they do not differentiate bleeding events that have different risks of death (i.e., bleeding in vs. outside the brain). The goal of this study is to develop new scoring systems that will enable physicians to estimate the probabilities of a patient first experiencing death, stroke, bleeding in the brain, and bleeding outside of the brain in the year after atrial fibrillation diagnosis.  The new scoring systems may be useful to physicians and patients when making treatment decisions.","Treatment decisions in atrial fibrillation (AF) are often guided by risk stratification schemes for stroke and warfarin-associated bleeding.  However, these schemes have limited utility in the era of target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOAC).  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate new prediction models for the one-year competing risks of a first event among death, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and extracranial hemorrhage while also accounting for treatment change as a competing event.  To address these objectives, we will estimate the associations between previously-identified predictors and the four clinical events in a cohort of patients with incident non-valvular AF for whom oral anticoagulants may be appropriate.   The index date will be 90 days after AF diagnosis, a landmark chosen based on previous work. The dependent variables include the times from index date to all-cause death, ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, extracranial hemorrhage, and change in treatment status.  Independent variables include treatment at index (none, warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban), predictors of stroke, predictors of major bleeding, and concurrent medications.  Fine-Gray regression models will be used with a variable selection procedure to estimate the associations. The validity (fit) of the models will be assessed using concordance statistics.

A population based cohort study utilising electronically linked health records.,"To plan health services it is crucial to understand the number of people affected by diseases and identify areas where improvements could be made to reduce ill health and death. Therefore we previously carried out a study funded by Coeliac UK and Core charity, to estimate the number of people affected by coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis (a skin condition associated with coeliac disease and gluten intolerance) in the UK. Our study showed a rise in the occurrence of coeliac disease over a 22-year period up to 2011, with wide variations by region. Whether the increase in incidence continued and whether the regional variation has reduced is important in understanding whether these disparities in diagnosis are improving.

In another of our previous studies also, we highlighted that people with coeliac disease were given a prior diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting delayed diagnosis as an area for improvement. We do not know whether misdiagnosis is still a continuing issue and how common it is currently occurring. 

The study we propose which is funded by Coeliac UK aims to provide updated information on the occurrence and misdiagnosis of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). We will estimate the number of people with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis in the UK for the period between 2011 and 2015, and re-examine how often misdiagnosis of coeliac disease occurs.","There is a consistent 1% serological prevalence of Coeliac disease across the UK that was not changing over time. However, our previous study up until 2011 found a rising incidence of the disease and a wide regional variation. We do not know whether the rise in incidence of clinical diagnosis has continued or whether the regional variation has improved.

Moving to areas of improvement, our previously conducted case control study of prior diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in coeliac cases compared to controls, found an almost four fold excess of IBS diagnoses prior to a coeliac diagnosis compared to controls, suggesting a delay to the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Equally we do not know if diagnostic delay is an ongoing issue and how actively clinicians seek to avoid misdiagnosis. 

Using the most up to date data available, this study will update our previous work on trends and variations in the occurrence of coeliac disease and DH and re-assess whether misdiagnosis of Coeliac disease in the UK is continuing. We will first estimate the prevalence and incidence of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis in the UK from 2011 to 2015 inclusive. Secondly, we will determine the number of people with coeliac disease previously diagnosed with either irritable bowel syndrome (adults) or functional abdominal pain (children).","Prevalence of incidence of coeliac disease

We aim to improve on this by using data in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to estimate these patterns. We will carry out a study of the alcohol drinking population and a sample of all patients, following them up in time. We will provide information on basic descriptions of this population such as counting how many alcohol misusers there are, how common they are within the GP data, how old they are, and their genders, among others. We will also present their chances of dying from any cause, from common causes of death, as well as from the causes of death that are related specifically to the drinking of alcohol. We will compare these patterns to those of other groups within the GP data, such as the whole GP population and low-risk drinkers.","The mortality patterns of the alcohol misusing population have been relatively under-explored. This hinders the planning of health services that are tailored to the health needs of this population. We aim to contribute to reducing this knowledge gap by conducting a cohort study of recognised alcohol misusing, non-drinking, low-risk drinking and the general populations in the CPRD dataset. We will provide descriptive epidemiological information on the numbers, prevalence and basic demographic characteristics of these groups.

1616632475-1915,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=40,Measuring the potential adverse impact of the adoption of prescribing guidelines in primary care,"The more widely that antibiotics are used, the more likely bacteria are to become resistant to them. NHS general practices (GP) are responsible for the majority of the antibiotics prescribed in the community. There is evidence that prescribing antibiotics is not always necessary, for some conditions a patient's recovery time with or without antibiotics is similar and therefore antibiotic prescribing is often inappropriate. To counteract the increase in resistance to antibiotics seen, new antibiotic prescribing targets have been published to encourage general practices to reduce antibiotic prescribing. Where a treatment is required for a bacterial infection and the treatment time is delayed, or where treatment is not provided, a more severe infection may develop as a consequence. A more serious infection, including infections of the blood, would increase a patient's risk of severe illness and death. The purpose of this study is to use routinely collected data from a sample of GPs and hospitals across England, to investigate the effect of a national intervention (introduced to reduce antibiotic prescribing) on levels of primary care prescribing and the associated unintended health outcomes that may occur consequently. Findings from this study would contribute to wider evaluation of the quality premium/policy change.","Antibiotics differ to other medical drugs, as their overuse and misuse selects resistance and weakens their effectiveness. The threat of antimicrobial resistance has been of growing public health concern, with the apprehension that many common and serious infections will become increasingly difficult to treat, if not entirely untreatable with pan-resistant infections. In response to the increase of antimicrobial resistance, quality premiums were introduced to improve antibiotic prescribing. This change should impact and reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure, with the intention of easing or slowing the rate of resistance. A reduction in overall antimicrobial prescribing however, may be accompanied with a reduction in appropriate therapy. A delay in treatment where antibiotics are required permits bacteria to propagate and may cause more severe infections or other clinical complications, e.g. bacteraemia, death. This study will analyse linked Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD), Hospital Episode Statistic (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) data to examine a patient's pathway through the healthcare system and distinguish any adverse outcomes related to the introduction of the quality premiums. Time series analysis will be completed to examine changes in the time trends of prescribing antibiotics and adverse outcomes, prior to and following the intervention (i.e. the Quality premium).","Outcomes of interest: 
1) Antibiotic prescription rate: Have prescribing practices of antibiotics altered? Has there been a reduction in antibiotic prescribing since the introduction of the quality premiums; assessed by identifying variations in: 
- Proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics for diagnoses of interest 
- The number of antibiotic items per STAR-PU (specific therapeutic group age-sex weightings related prescribing units). 
- Stratifying measures above by total or broad-spectrum antibiotics (co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, quinolones). 
2) Incidence of adverse consequences. Primary and secondary care outcomes have been identified using CPRD and ICD-10 codes. 
a) Incidence in primary care as well as an increase in severity will be assessed; as indicated by hospital admission (for the same or clinically related condition during 60 days following diagnosis) and mortality (60 day-all cause mortality from initial consultation).

It is largely unknown what the reasons for the disease development are. Diabetes is a disease of high sugar levels in blood. Researchers found diabetes seems to be somewhat associated with Meniere's disease. We intend to assess how many patients with MD also have diabetes and/or use various antidiabetic drugs, and we intend to compare these figures to a group of control patients not suffering from MD. We would like to find out whether diabetes and/or using antidiabetic drugs are associated with an altered relative risk of developing MD. Since diabetes is a frequent disease on the rise, and since antidiabetic drugs are widely and increasingly used, a possible association between diabetes and MD is of substantial public health interest.","Meniere's disease (MD) is a disease of the inner ear. There is only limited data on the epidemiology of MD, and the underlying pathology is still poorly understood. There are several hypotheses about the pathophysiology, but only few associations have been explored in rather small study populations. There is only little evidence on the association between diabetes mellitus overall, diabetes severity, diabetes control, diabetes duration and use of antidiabetic treatment in relation to the risk of developing incident MD. Previous studies suggested that patients with MD have a carbohydrate metabolism disorder, and a correlation with advanced hyperinsulinemia has been proposed. Therefore, diabetes itself or its treatment could influence the risk of onset of MD.
We will apply multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to explore in a large observational case-control analysis the association between diabetes and use of antidiabetic drugs and their association with the occurrence of MD.",Incident diagnosis of Meniere's disease accompanied by use of betahistine,"Professor Christoph Meier - Chief Investigator - University of Basel

A non-interventional study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database","This study plans to investigate what therapies people are prescribed when they are first diagnosed with mild or moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. 

European treatment guidelines recommend that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), a medicine often known as steroids which reduces swelling and reduce the body's own defences, are reserved for COPD patients with severe or very severe disease, but there is evidence that ICS is frequently used in mild and moderate patients.

This study will investigate the factors which affect whether a GP decides to prescribe ICS treatment or a non-ICS treatment combination to a mild/moderate patient when they are first diagnosed with COPD.

We also plan to look at the prescribing trends in mild/moderate COPD patients over the last 10 years, to see whether the pattern of prescribing to these patients has changed over time.","This study is a non-interventional cohort study using existing data (CPRD), to evaluate the factors associated with therapy decisions in newly diagnosed COPD patients in GOLD  (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease1) groups A and B. The GOLD stages of airflow obstruction and dyspnea are widely used to quantify COPD severity into four categories, A (mild), B (moderate) C (severe) and D (very severe). Severity is determined by combining data from response to the MRC dyspnea questionnaire, the number of exacerbations in the past 12 months, and the FEV1 score (as a % of predicted).

The main objective is to assess which patient or practice characteristics influence the initial choice of ICS therapy combinations over non ICS therapy combinations at initial diagnosis of mild/moderate COPD.

The results from this study will be used to support the scientific understanding of how COPD patients in GOLD groups A and B are treated, and which patients are more likely to be inappropriately treated with ICS.

Comorbidities and demographic information will be described for the groups of patients initiated on different therapy combinations. Logistic regression will be used to investigate the factors which affect whether a GOLD A/B COPD patient is treated with an ICS containing therapy combination when diagnosed with COPD or a non-ICS therapy. 

We will also investigate the differences in patient and practice characteristics between GOLD A and B patients prescribed different therapy combinations at initial COPD diagnosis, and examine the trend in prescribing of COPD therapies to patients in GOLD groups A and B at initial COPD diagnosis over the last 10 years.","Changes in prescribing of five main classifications of medicines:

1616632451-1905,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=40,Use of routinely collected national data to determine the delays that lead to poor outcome for cancer patients in the UK,"Cancer is a major cause of mortality in the UK, accounting for nearly one in three deaths. Survival following diagnosis in the UK is lower compared to other Western and Northern European countries, with the largest difference in survival occurring in the first year after diagnosis. Also a higher percentage of patients present as an emergency in the UK. We believe delays along the patient's pathway accounts for these differences. CPRD linked data offers a unique opportunity to define all the clinical episodes along the pathway from first GP presentation to long term follow up including surgical and chemo- or radiotherapy treatment episodes. Our population will include all patients diagnosed with colorectal, breast, prostate, oesophageal, gastric or lung cancer. The findings of this study can help formulate a public health policy that concentrates resources along the parts of the pathway that are most likely to improve survival  in the UK.","Survival following cancer diagnosis in the UK is lower compared to other Western and Northern European countries. The symptomatic patient pathway begins with the first symptom, and involves clinical events such as the first GP consultation, hospital appointments, investigations, and treatment. Our hypothesis is that detrimental events during the patients diagnosis and treatment lead to delays, causing the poor 1-year survival seen in the UK. Our aim is to identify the causes of these delays by analysing CPRD linked data - GP consultations, HES admissions, NCIN cancer dataset and ONS mortality data. CPRD is the largest source of routinely collected information available in the UK. Studies have shown CPRD is a reliable source of consultation dates, co-morbidities, complications, medications and cancer diagnoses. Further information regarding chemo-/radiotherapy and complications following surgery can be identified in HES. However, CPRD linked data is limited as the length of symptoms before consultation and outpatient data is not routinely available. 

For the purpose of this study, the patient pathway will be split into before and after diagnosis. We will determine the effect of the type of symptom, co-morbidity, demographics and geographical location on a delay in diagnosis, and how this effects survival. Following diagnosis, the type of operation (if relevant), stage of tumour, co-morbidities and complications will be used in multilevel regression modelling to determine the effect on survival.  

The date of diagnosis will be determined on a hierarchal level of evidence as set out by the International Association of Cancer Registries, with first histological confirmation being the preferred date of diagnosis.


Our study population criterion is any patient over the age of 18 that has a diagnosis of colorectal, breast, prostate, oesophogastric or lung cancer in the NCIN cancer dataset, and has linked data in CPRD. 

Patients who survive beyond one year after diagnosis will act as controls, as previous studies have shown the largest difference in survival between the UK and northern Europe occurs in the first 12 months.  Secondary analysis will compare patients who have had a curative resection to those who have not, as the latter will be used as a surrogate for palliative treatment. A third analysis will compare patients diagnosed electively vs. emergency, as the latter group are known to have a worse survival. Previous studies that have attempted to test this hypothesis using local datasets or notes have not been able to include sufficient patient numbers and confounders. 

The accuracy of HES has been previously verified, by comparing to patient notes. Analysis of the CPRD data from within our department has demonstrated there is sufficient number of clinical episodes regarding cancer symptoms before diagnosis, and complications in the community following treatment. A similar process has also been carried out for CPRD and is described in a systematic review. This latter publication found a median of over 95% (range 74-100) concordance for cancer related diagnoses. A concordance of 83% has also been noted when CPRD has been compared to the cancer registry.

This happens after injuries and is common in younger patients. It is very painful and the shoulder often stays dislocated until it is 'put back' in hospital. The joint can remain 'unstable' with more dislocations. The two main ways of treating this problem are physiotherapy and surgery. We still don't know the best choice and so it is important to know if surgery or physiotherapy after one dislocation is worthwhile in preventing further problems. 
We should be able to answer this question using information that is already available within the NHS in two computerised systems called CPRD and HES.

The demographic shift to an older surviving population has been accompanied by a decline in illness and death owing to HIV infection and a concomitant rise in the proportion owing to non-HIV diseases, including age-related disease (co-morbidities).  There is evidence that HIV itself increases the risk of developing some types of age-related disease particularly heart disease. This study is designed to provide evidence to aid general practitioners and secondary care professionals understand the likely co-morbidities to be found in an aging HIV+ve population and thus facilitate future shared care between the two systems. Patients will be compared to patients without HIV of similar age, to assess rates of current co-morbidities, and to follow patients for up to ten years to assess the development of new diseases.

Little is known about how many and what types of medicines patients are prescribed towards the end of life, either for the treatment of long-term health conditions or for symptom control in the final period of life. Understanding these issues is important if we are to develop successful ways of improving the quality of patient care and medicines use in such patients. 

We will examine how the numbers and types of medicines prescribed by GPs change over the 12-month period prior to death, and examine what factors affect these patterns of medicines use, such as age, sex, social deprivation, different health problems and cause of death.

This work has the potential to benefit a large number of patients. It will help to identify patients who are at risk of experiencing inappropriate medicines towards the end of their life, and those who do or do not receive medication such as morphine for symptom control. It will help us design ways of improving the quality of prescribing and care for patients in the final months of life.","Polypharmacy, driven by an ageing, multimorbid population and a culture of single-condition guideline-driven prescribing, is becoming increasingly widespread in primary care. The evidence base for many medications is lacking in older, frail and multimorbid populations; benefits may be particularly questionable as the end of life approaches, especially where the intended gain from treatments may only be realised over several years. Little is known about patterns of polypharmacy and palliative medication towards the end of life in the general practice setting, and understanding these issues is central to developing and targeting medication optimisation strategies relevant to patients towards the end of life.

A retrospective cohort analysis will be conducted for all patients that died in 2009-2014. Prescribing data during the final 12 months of life will be studied. Descriptive analyses of temporal trends in polypharmacy and drug classes specific to symptom management (e.g. opioids) will be carried out, including modelling the association of prescribing change with cause of death.

This work will be a very important contribution to the literature on end-of-life care. It will generate an understanding of factors influencing prescribing towards the end of life, and improve the identification of individuals subject to suboptimal prescribing.","Changes in prescribing of five main classifications of medicines:

There are only a few treatments that temporarily help symptoms such as memory loss; however, these eventually become ineffective as the underlying disease progresses unabated. Part of the difficulty of treating Alzheimer's disease is that it involves the activation of many destructive processes in the brain, each of which needs treatment simultaneously if the progression of the disease is to be halted. We hope to investigate the possibility of using a more time- and cost-effective method to reposition new drugs for the prevention or treatment of the disease. Drug development can take over 20 years and cost up to £1billion per eventually licensed drug. We wish to investigate the potential of using a number of existing drugs, already prescribed for other conditions that may offer protection to the brain, as a cheaper and more rapid method of identifying new drugs. To explore this we will test whether these treatments protect against or increase the risk of other neurodegenerative diseases, and to what extent this effect is further enhanced when existing dementia therapies are co-administered. This could then help to prioritise groups of drugs that may be beneficial in the treatment of a number of neurological conditions and therefore accelerate the formal testing of recognised safe and cost-effective drugs as new potential approaches  for preventing or treating Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.","There is urgent need for new evidence about medications that could influence the incidence and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. One promising approach is to investigate drug repositioning, which offers a time- and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. A recent consensus study of dementia experts identified a short-list of individual and classes of prescribed drugs that may be repurposed as novel treatments for dementia. The short-list included compounds used to treat hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes, all of which could be classed as having 'cerebroprotective' properties and have variable levels of pre-clinical evidence that suggest they may have beneficial effects for various aspects of dementia pathology. However as yet there is limited pharmacoepidemiological data to support their effects in human populations. 

Our primary aim, therefore, is to investigate whether these existing medications, previously identified as potentially cerebroprotective, could be repurposed to prevent or treat Alzheime''s disease and other types of dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. We will conduct an observational cohort study to investigate the relationship of these medications with incidence and post-diagnosis survival of patients and at the same time identify to what extent any observed associations are altered when existing dementia therapies are co-administered. Collectively these findings will allow the prioritisation of drugs to be tested as repurposed treatments in clinical trials of these conditions in the future.","Diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease of interest

At present, we only know that antidepressant use can change weight in the short term, with most studies looking at the first three months, and little evidence beyond one year. This study will investigate changes in body weight in patients over longer time periods, and look for differences in those who are given antidepressants for a short time compared to those who use them over longer periods. We will also investigate whether patients' whose weight changes after using antidepressants goes back to normal when they stop using them. There has been a huge rise in the use of antidepressants in recent years, and doctors should be aware of the possible side-effects of these drugs on patients' weight. This is particularly important because people with depression are more likely to become obese, and obese people are more likely to become depressed. Both obesity and depression are common conditions that place a great burden on the health system. This research will give us a better understanding of how patients' weight can change when they become depressed and receive treatment for their depression.",Current research evidence on weight change alongside the use of antidepressants is limited by small sample sizes and short term reporting. Existing evidence suggests that antidepressant drugs can be associated with changes in body weight. The association between antidepressant use and weight change is complicated by the bidirectional relationship between depression and obesity. The present study will use the electronic health records of adults with at least three weight measurements to assess both short- and long-term body weight changes in patients who have been prescribed antidepressant drugs acutely and long-term. We will also investigate body weight changes after cessation of antidepressant use. Patients will be divided by their depression status using diagnostic medical codes and prescriptions of antidepressant drugs. In the face of a great need for care relating to both depression and obesity the results of this study will provide valuable information for health service planning and providers.,"Body weight

COPD can lead chronic breathing problems and even death. COPD is very common, and it is expected that by the year 2020 it will be the third highest cause of death in the world. One of the main causes of this devastating disease is smoking cigarettes, but the start of COPD can also be triggered by other environmental factors, such as allergens. COPD is a  complex disease. There is no cure for COPD, but symptoms (difficulty breathing) can be managed with treatment. Inhaled corticosteriods are commonly used, but not effective in all patients. One factor that may be useful in helping decide which patients may respond to inhaled corticosteroids are ""eosinophils"" - a type of white blood cell. An eosinophil count is a blood test that measures the quantity of eosinophils in a patient's body. Patients with larger numbers of these white blood cells (eosinophils) may respond better to inhaled corticosteroid treatments. This would avoid unnecessary use of corticosteroids in patients unlikely to see improvement in breathing difficulties. But it is first important to know how stable eosinophil counts are in patients with COPD. The study aims to see how stable eosinophil counts are in COPD patients and non-COPD patients. We will also look at stability by eosinophil counts at baseline gender, age, and smoking status.","Rationale: Chronic Obstructive disease is an inflammatory disease which is known to affect the airways of the lungs. Pathophysiology of the disease is mediated by release of macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils , cytokine, and CD8+ lymphocytes. Peripheral eosinophil counts are increasingly recognised as a biomarker for response to inhaled corticosteroids in COPD and may assist in better targeting treatments to patients who will benefit most. However, little is known about the long-term stability of blood eosinophils in COPD and the impact of age, gender and eosinophil counts. Greater understanding of this subject area can help gain better understanding needed to tailor COPD treatments to specific patient groups, potentially reducing the cost of managing the disease and increasing the chance of improved outcomes.  
Objective: The study therefore aims to determine the stability of blood eosinophil counts in COPD patients and non-COPD patients. 
Methods: The primary outcome will be the stability of blood eosinophil count, with stability defined as a count remaining persistently at <2% or >/= 2%. Patients will be followed until end of study period, or when defined as unstable (""failure""). Kaplan Meier curves will be plotted to show eosinophil stability, stratified by eosinophil counts at baseline age groups, gender, and smoking status.",Stability of blood eosinophil count,"Professor Frank de Vries - Chief Investigator - Utrecht University

First-line treatment is based on antipsychotics, but there are many individuals who do not respond favourably to these drugs. There have been very few new treatments for schizophrenia developed over recent years, however, in part because the biological mechanisms underlying the origin of the disease are poorly understood. Recently, several researchers have proposed that inflammation of certain parts of the brain could precipitate the condition, and that anti-inflammatory drugs could thus have a protective effect in psychotic illness. Minocycline, an antibiotic used for acne treatment, has been proposed to exert these beneficial effects. Although small-scale clinical studies have been conducted to investigate this effect in patients, large-scale studies are required to confirm these observations.
The aim of this study is to test if oral minocycline use by adolescents to treat acne has a beneficial effect resulting in decreased likelihood of developing a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia. Results of this study could further our understanding of the physiological basis of the disease, and perhaps allow development of early interventions which might improve prognosis, and facilitate development of related compounds useful in clinical practice.","OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence of a possible relationship between treatment with minocycline and a neuroprotective effect against the development of psychosis. 
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study is proposed, using anonymized CPRD data. The source population are patients with a diagnosis of acne recorded over the 10-year period between 1991 and 2000. The medical histories are determined for those patients prescribed for a minimum of two months between 1991 and 2000 either (a) oral minocycline (test group) or (b) alternative oral treatment plus/or topical erythromycin or clarithromycin but never minocycline for acne (control group). The incidence of patients diagnosed with psychosis (see codes in Appendix 1, taken to include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar affective disorder) between 1991 and 2015 are compared in the two cohorts. 
DATA ANALYSIS: The CPRD data will be used to determine the incidence rates for development of psychosis in the minocycline-treatment group and in the control group patients. The data will also be used to model the censored time-to-event data for the two patient groups, with consideration of treatment group, age, and gender, etc., as explanatory co-variates.

Reactivation of the virus occurs when the immunity towards VZV wanes below a certain critical level. An increased risk of herpes zoster is thus observed among patient with immunosuppression, including those with inherited immunodeficiency and immunosuppression induced by drugs (e.g. chemotherapy), radiotherapy, or other disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or cancer).
Psychological stress may result in suppression of the immune system and thus possibly an increased risk of herpes zoster. However, data from large epidemiological studies on psychological stressors as risk factors for herpes zoster are sparse and conflicting. 
Using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), we will investigate whether individuals diagnosed with herpes zoster have more frequent history of psychological stress than individuals without zoster, including partner bereavement, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and stress or adjustment disorder. We will explore the impact of recentness and severity of stress. Data will be published together with results from parallel analyses conducted on Danish data. The study is a health research study.","We will use CPRD and HES data to conduct a case-control study of the association between psychological stress and the risk of herpes zoster. 
We will identify all adults with a first-time diagnosis of herpes zoster between 2000 to 2014. We will use incidence density sampling to select four controls per case matched by age, sex and practice. The date of herpes zoster diagnosis will be considered the index date for cases and their matched controls. 
We will identify history of partner bereavement, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and stress or adjustment disorder prior to index date. We will categorise bereavement according to whether the partner death was foreseen, as measured by the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index and codes indicating terminal disease. For the psychiatric diagnoses, we will categorise severity as severe (requiring inpatient admission), moderate (requiring referral to other mental health service) or mild (remaining patients) based on healthcare records within 90 days before index date. 
Using conditional logistic regression, we will compute odds ratios with 99% confidence intervals for the association between each psychological stressor and herpes zoster adjusting for risk factors for herpes zoster.

If we can better identify which types of patients are hospitalised as an emergency, it will help with their clinical management by their GP and healthcare team. To do this, we plan to combine GP consultation records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with databases of hospital admissions and death certificates for participating practices who have given their consent for their data to be used in research. We will build statistical models to predict which patients are hospitalised or die within a year of being diagnosed with heart failure, taking into account factors such as their age, gender, medications and other medical problems; most research so far in this area has focused on hospital admission data, which lack some key information that CPRD captures.","Our objectives are to identify the main predictors of emergency (re)hospitalisation in patients with heart failure and their relative importance.

All patients in the database up to March 2014 will be considered, taking into account patient and practice data quality flags, database follow-up, eligibility and coverage periods. Predictors will include demographics, comorbidities, frailty, physiology and medications.

Although relatively rare, the incidence of liver cancer has been rising rapidly in the United Kingdom.  Notably, in almost all areas worldwide, the incidence rate of liver cancer is two- to three-fold higher in men than women, which may be partially explained by sex-specific prevalence of risk factors. Prolactin is a protein hormone that is expressed at higher levels in women than men. Prolactin is best known for its effects on the mammary gland, but it also has a variety of other biological functions, including its regulation of immune responses.  One study found that in mice, prolactin prevented hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by restricting innate immune activation of c-myc. The use of domperidone, an anti-dopamine drug that has a prolactin-releasing effect, was found to prevent HCC in tumor-prone male mice.  To our knowledge, the association of domperidone use with liver cancer risk has not been reported in population studies.  Thus, we propose to conduct a case-control study of primary liver cancer in relation to domperidone use.","We aim to conduct a case-control study to assess the association between use of domperidone and the subsequent development of liver cancer among individuals in the CPRD.

We will additionally classify use of domperidone according to duration and total number of prescriptions received.  We will use conditional logistic regression to assess crude and adjusted risk estimates (odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for use of domperidone and the risk of developing liver cancer.

Ropinirole is a dopamine agonist which works by mimicking the effects of dopamine and stimulates dopamine receptors. Ropinirole has been marketed for the treatment of PD for over fifteen years and shown to be well tolerated and effective. The proposed observational database study is required as part of a post marketing regulatory commitment to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to evaluate the long term safety of the prolonged release formulation of ropinirole (ropinirole-PR). It is proposed to estimate the rate of new cases of dyskinesias (involuntary movements), on-off phenomena (a switch between mobility and immobility) and impulse control disorders, in PD patients initiating ropinirole-PR monotherapy as compared to those initiating an immediate release dopamine agonist as monotherapy. The study will use data recorded in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) supplemented with data to be obtained by General Practitioner (GP) questionnaires.","This retrospective observational study will use a propensity score matched cohort design to estimate the incidence of dyskinesias, on-off phenomena and impulse control disorders amongst PD patients initiating ropinirole-PR monotherapy (ropinirole-PR cohort) compared to those initiating immediate release dopamine agonist monotherapy(IR-DA cohort). PD patients with at least one script of a dopamine agonist of interest (ropinirole-PR or an immediate release DA) prescribed between 2004-2012 and a minimum of 12 months registration prior to index date (date of treatment initiation) will be included.

We will use individual patient-level data to estimate the explore changes in time to diagnosis and diagnostic tests a) over time b) by comparing patients with NICE-qualifying symptoms to those without, and c) by comparing cancers with new NICE recommendations in 2015 to those with unchanged recommendations.  The latter groups capture the background influences affecting outcomes, and therefore act as a 'control' group, allowing us to measure the additional impact of the guidelines on patients with NICE-qualifying symptoms. Throughout this research process we will explore ways in which we might semi-automate the monitoring process for the future. 

Diagnostic activity (including investigations and referrals for suspected cancer) has increased progressively between the 2005 and 2015 NICE guidance, perhaps influenced by the research evidence on which the guidelines were based. This analysis is necessary to document the degree by which times to diagnosis have changed in the last few years, and to establish benchmarks for subsequent evaluation of any changes following the 2015 guidance.","The objectives of the study are to explore changes in diagnostic interval and diagnostic activity of cancers from 2000-2015, and to estimate the early impact of the NICE 2015 suspected cancers guidelines. 

We will examine 13 cancers diagnosed since 2000: lung, oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, colorectal, breast, ovary, uterus, prostate, bladder, kidney, melanoma and myeloma. These cancers, including all the common ones, are those for which the 2015 guidelines made a major alteration in recommendations from the previous 2005 guidance, so the impact of the 2015 guidelines, should arise primarily within these 13 cancers. For other cancers, little or no change was made, and so we check this by studying a further 10 cancers to see if any change has arisen over the same time period. 

We will use a difference in differences approach to estimate the impact of the new policy on outcomes for patients with NICE-qualifying symptoms relative to those without.   Linear and quantile regression models will be fitted to compare the mean and quantile diagnostic interval between the cohorts, using tests of interaction to compare changes in our primary outcome, diagnostic interval, between presentation of NICE-qualifying symptom alone or in combination and presentation of non-NICE-qualifying symptom.","Diagnostic interval, stage at diagnosis, treatment with curative intent, survival","Professor William Hamilton - Chief Investigator - University of Exeter

This is particularly likely when the person is elderly, has other medical problems or is taking certain medication.

Certain people are more likely to develop CVD than others (e.g. smokers, those who are overweight or have high blood pressure (BP)) and calculators exist to predict how likely it is that an individual will develop CVD in the future. For those at particularly high risk of CVD, doctors are encouraged to give these individuals advice about lifestyle changes and treatment that may prevent the disease.

Recent research has also shown that having highly variable (instead of stable) BP may also increase the chances of developing CVD. The aim of this study is to determine if information about BP variability should be included in a new calculator to predict the chance of developing CVD. Two calculators will therefore be developed; one with and one without information about BP variability in addition to other traditional patient characteristics. The accuracy of predictions from the calculators will then be compared.","Recent research has suggested that BP variability may be an important risk factor for CVD (over and above mean), in particular variability in visit-to-visit BP measurements. However, although the additional prognostic value of BP variability has been demonstrated through survival analysis of long-term cohort and trial data, the utility of this factor in a risk prediction model has not been assessed. This study aims to develop two risk scores to predict future risk of CVD in individuals, one including traditional risk factors alone and a second additionally including BP variability as a risk factor. Both risk scores will be developed using data from adults without prior history of CVD, with linkage to mortality and hospital episodes data (to more accurately ascertain events) and deprivation data.

The risk scores will be developed in a derivation subsample using parametric survival models and fractional polynomials to model the relationship between traditional CVD risk factors and CVD outcomes. The accuracy of the two risk scores will be compared to each other in terms of discrimination, calibration and net reclassification index in a validation subsample.","Cardiovascular events;

Accumulation of degradation products can occur in patients with renal (kidney) impairment, which is expected to give a higher risk of hypoglycaemia. However, there is sparse and conflicting data regarding the incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients with renal impairment. As diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease, it is important to have knowledge about hypoglycaemic effects of sulphonylureas in patients with renal impairment.

For some, this is associated with an increase in co-morbidity, functional dependence and poor quality of life, with consequent higher health and social care need. This population need is reflected in the hospital population as patients over the age of 65 constitute two thirds of admissions, 40% of all hospital bed days and 65% of NHS spend in acute care. Most clinicians would regard this group as representing a frailer population. 
Assessing frailty reliably in acute care is a research priority. Despite this, at present, there is no consensus on an operational definition of frailty. A sensitive, clinically relevant and acceptable model is needed. This study is based on a frailty model that tested whether ""frailty syndromes"" - such as falls, confusion and weight loss - are a valid measure of frailty in the acute hospital care population in England. We seek to validate and refine this model in a database of linked primary and secondary care data, as the first step of developing a sensitive clinically relevant assessment tool to be used at point of access of acute care.","This study aims are to develop and validate a risk prediction model based on frailty syndromes using primary care data, which will allow the burden of frailty at a population level to be defined and help predict and identify the severity of frailty. A previously published frailty model developed from NHS HES data; The Frailty Model in Acute Care (FMAC) will be used to assess its applicability in a national (England) primary care data set (CPRD data). The background to the model is that geriatric syndromes are recognized indicators of frailty. The Frailty model explored 3 key outcomes: In hospital mortality, 30 day readmission to hospital and functional dependence. 
The study will use an open cohort of randomly selected patients aged 55-99 years between 2008 and 2010 registered with a CPRD GP practice for at least one year. Within the cohort those individuals having 'frailty syndrome', will be defined by using the identified frailty deficits and Read Codes. Mixed-effect logistic regression will be used for binary outcomes, linear mixed model for linear outcomes and mixed-effect Poisson for count outcomes. Cox Proportional Hazard model will be used to perform survival analyses.
For cross-validation of the frailty index we will use both receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and, for survival analysis, Harrel's C statistics.","Healthcare utilisation:

Most people do not realise they have been infected and in the majority of people the virus causes a mild flu like illness which gets better by itself. After the illness the infection may persist for life.  It is thought that it is managed by a person's immune system and does not cause noticeable symptoms. However, there is some evidence that being infected with the virus may increase the risk of death. In particular there may be a link between CMV infection and death related to cardiovascular disease (heart attacks or strokes for example); however the evidence is not clear cut. This research aims to understand if CMV infection is associated with deaths related to cardiovascular disease.
We will use GP records to identify one group of patients who have had a positive test result for CMV infection and a second group of people who have negative test results or who have never been tested for CMV.

1616632411-1889,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=41,Predictors of complications of venous thromboembolism,"Background
Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of blood clot in deep veins, usually in a lower limb. Blood clots can break off and travel in the blood, may get trapped in the lung and result in a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Together deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Treatment guidelines recommend use of blood thinners (anticoagulants) like heparin and warfarin to treat VTE and to prevent recurrent VTEs.
The fear of severe bleeding from anticoagulants could result in physicians avoiding anticoagulants in patients who are likely to benefit from them. Bleeding in patients initially treated with anticoagulants could result in discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy and consequently in decreasing the benefit of anticoagulant therapy. 
Purpose of the study
The relationship between recurrent VTE, bleeding and discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment in VTE patients is not well described. This study will investigate the frequency and predictors of VTE complications.
Potential importance of the findings
This study may help guide clinicians to identify patients for whom the benefits of anticoagulants outweigh the risks.","Objectives
This study will investigate the predictors for recurrent VTE, bleeding and discontinuation of Vitamin K antagonists (VKA).
Methods
Observational cohort study of patients with a first VTE between January 2008 and March 2015 who are given VKA within 60 days of the initial VTE. The study cohort will be identified through the CPRD and HES. 
Data analysis
Multivariate hazard ratios will be derived from Cox regression models comparing patients with the presence of a covariate with those without the covariate. The models will include time-dependent predictors, such as new provoking events or new comorbid conditions.

Methods: We will use our knowledge from extensive simulations that were based on realistic settings to examine in a cohort of CPRD patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whether non-insulin regimens differentially affect the occurrence of the aforementioned adverse events in. Our method will adjust for demographic and clinical characteristics that affect the use of the different regimens.

Outcomes: We will provide researchers with guidelines for choosing the most appropriate statistical method when comparing more than three treatments.

Most patients with type 2 diabetes are treated with drugs to lower blood sugar (glucose) levels, with the aim of reducing or delaying the damaging effects of diabetes.
It is well known that high blood glucose has damaging effects on the body, but lower-than-normal blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) can also be harmful and this may explain the increased risk of death associated with strict glucose control.  Some diabetes drugs are associated with a higher risk of hypoglycaemia than others. The objective of this study is to compare the association between glucose levels and risk of death in patients with type 2 diabetes who are treated with the higher-risk drugs and in those treated with the low-risk drugs. 
People with type 2 diabetes will be identified from CPRD and classified into treatment groups according to whether they are being treated with higher-risk or low-risk therapies. The association between glucose levels and risk of death within each treatment group will be examined using statistical modelling to adjust for other potential causes of death in type 2 diabetes.","A U-shaped association between glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and all-cause mortality has been demonstrated previously.

Published case reports suggested that DM patients might be at high risk of various benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) tumors. We conducted the first study evaluating cancer risk in DM patients using healthcare data from Sweden and Denmark. Our study found that DM patients had a two-fold increased risk of all cancers combined and excess risk for several site-specific cancers including those of the endometrium (the lining of the uterus), ovary, brain, large bowl, and possibly thyroid gland, pancreas, and skin cancer. In our previous work, we lacked specific data related to DM disease subtype (i.e., type 1 or 2). We also could not assess the risk of DM on benign tumors, since they are not recorded in the Scandinavian cancer registries, and had no data regarding possible factors contributing to this observation. We plan to use anonymised electronic medical records from the CPRD Gold database to quantify tumor burden in DM patients (both benign and malignant), and to identify possible risk factors.

In this project, we propose to evaluate the risk of both benign and malignant tumors in patients with DM type 1 (DM1, also called Steinert's disease), identify potential clinical factors and risk modifiers for this observation. Accordingly, we plan to compare the risk of developing benign and malignant tumors in a cohort of DM patients identified from CPRD Gold and the integrated hospital episode statistics (HES) database with tumor risk in a matched control cohort of DM1-free individuals. Our analyses will quantify overall and site-specific tumor risks among DM1 patients and will identify risk factors contributing to such events.

1616632418-1892,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=41,Assessing drivers of effectiveness and safety using real life data: anticoagulants as a case study,"When a new drug is introduced to the market, there is still limited evidence on the benefit-risk balance compared to well establish agents. Although large trials are carried out before registration of a new drug, the patients included in such trials are carefully selected and not necessarily representative for the patients that doctors initially prescribe it to.   

With the current study we would like to research how patients that start with a new drug differ from patients that start the older drug and how this changes over time, once there is more experience with the newer drug. Furthermore, we would like to know how we could compare the old drug with the new drug in terms of effectiveness and safety when the two patient groups are not comparable with respect to characteristics and if the difference in benefit-risk balance will differ over time. 

As a case study we will use the new oral anticoagulants (NOACS) that were introduced in 2010 for the prevention of ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The comparator, warfarin, has been the cornerstone in treatment for many years, with which there is widespread experience.","Objective
With this study we aim to characterize new users of NOACs and new users of warfarin and to compare effect size of these drugs in relation to time since launch of the NAOCs in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Furthermore, we would like to assess different analytical approaches to estimate the comparative effectiveness/safety over time. Results will be compared to a similar study carried out in the US MarketScan data.   

Methods
A retrospective cohort study will be conducted within the UK CPRD from 2010-2013. Patients with a diagnosis of AF and with at least one first prescription of either warfarin or one of the NOACs will be extracted. They will be followed from the date of first prescription until the occurrence of stroke, a major bleeding, systemic embolism or all-cause mortality event.  

Data analysis 
Covariate plots and propensity plots will be used to show how patient characteristics change over time. Comparative effectiveness/safety of warfarin and NOACs will be evaluated at different time points using a propensity score matched model. Additional we will estimate effect sizes again with conventional logistic regression and disease risk score methods.","Primary outcome: major bleeding and all strokes

One type of drug used as treatment is called a corticosteroid. Due to their anti-inflammatory effects, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) provide extensive benefit to patients with respiratory diseases associated with an allergic reaction, such as asthma. Medical guidelines for the treatment of COPD suggest that ICS should only be used in patients with moderate to severe disease because studies have revealed these patients receive the most benefit from the drug. Unfortunately, there are numerous adverse effects associated with taking the drug, including oral thrush (a fungal infection), skin bruising and pneumonia. Studies have also found that long term use of ICS in high quantities is associated with increased diagnoses of persistent conditions including Type 2 Diabetes and osteoporosis. Despite the worrying adverse effects associated with ICS treatment, doctors in GP practices in the UK give them to their patients more than guidelines suggest. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of ICS use on Type 2 Diabetes, osteoporosis and pneumonia in a group of patients with COPD in the UK.","The objective is to analyze the relationship between ICS use and Type 2 Diabetes onset, Type 2 Diabetes worsening disease control and disease progression, osteoporosis onset, and incidence of pneumonia. A further objective is to measure overuse of ICS according to guidelines. Firstly, these endpoints will be compared between an ICS therapy cohort and non-ICS therapy cohort. Subsequently, they will be analyzed within the ICS-therapy cohort only and compared by average daily dose, cumulative dose, drug type and inhaler device type. A 1-year baseline period prior to the date of first prescription of ICS therapy or first/additional prescription of non-ICS therapy (i.e. the index date) will be followed by a minimum 1-year outcome period. All of the patient's available data post index date will be utilized. Summary statistics will be produced for unmatched and matched data for all baseline variables by group. Time to event outcomes will be analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, reporting hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Continuous progression outcomes will be analyzed using paired t-tests and generalized estimating equations reporting mean changes with 95% confidence intervals. Count outcomes will be analyzed using conditional Poisson regression, reporting incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals.","Type 2 Diabetes onset - is defined in this study as a diagnostic Read code for Type 2 Diabetes, and/or antidiabetic drug prescriptions and/or two or more HbA1c readings > 6.5%. Given the use of Metformin for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), patients with a diagnosis of PCOS and a Metformin prescription will be excluded from the Type 2 Diabetes analysis. Type 2 Diabetes worsening disease control and disease progression - will be analyzed in the group of patients who have a diagnostic Read code for Type 2 Diabetes, and/or antidiabetic drug prescriptions and/or two or more HbA1c readings > 6.5% ever prior to index date. To ensure Metformin prescriptions for treatment of PCOS are not incorrectly counted as incidence of Type 2 Diabetes, patients with PCOS and a Metformin prescription ever prior to index date will be excluded. Worsening disease control will be measured by change in blood glucose level defined as increased glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) readings. Disease progression will be measured by treatment change. Osteoporosis onset - is defined in this study as a diagnostic Read code for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis drug prescriptions without an accompanying diagnosis code will not be considered indicative of osteoporosis presence given commonly prescribed osteoporosis drugs are prescribed for other conditions and are used for osteopenia. Incidence of pneumonia - is defined as a Read code for pneumonia, with a chest X-ray or hospitalization code within 30 days of pneumonia diagnostic code. In primary care records, chest x-rays and hospitalisations will be identified by Read codes. In secondary care records, ICD-10 codes will be used. A pneumonia code within 4 weeks of the last will be counted as the same case of pneumonia. Overuse of ICS - is defined as ICS drugs prescribed to patients in GOLD groups A and B. Number of patients who are classified as GOLD category A or B with ICS prescriptions will be presented as a proportion of the total number of patients who are classified as GOLD categories A or B.","Professor David Price - Chief Investigator - OPRI - Observational and Pragmatic Research Institute Pte Ltd

Acute flare-ups of COPD, called exacerbations, are one of the main drivers of illness and death related to COPD, and are often due to infection. During an exacerbation a patient may have trouble breathing and may have a cough that is worse than usual. Thus far two studies have found that higher levels of eosinophils, which are a marker of inflammation that can be detected through a blood test, are associated with a higher frequency of COPD exacerbations. 
This study seeks to expand the limited knowledge on whether patients with higher eosinophil levels are more likely to experience COPD exacerbations. The study will examine blood eosinophil levels of COPD patients and the frequency of COPD exacerbations in the time period following the measurement. Analysis will examine whether patients with higher eosinophil levels experience more frequent COPD exacerbations. Results will help show whether eosinophil levels could potentially be used to help identify patients at risk of COPD exacerbations. If so, it is possible that specific treatments could be offered to patients who might be more likely to experience exacerbations, potentially improving the health of these patients.","The objective is to examine the association between blood eosinophils and subsequent risk for exacerbations in patients with COPD being treated with long-acting and/or short-acting bronchodilators, with or without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).
The design is a retrospective cohort study of patients with COPD as evidenced by a medical code in the CPRD between January 2004 and February 2013. The index date is the date of the first blood eosinophil measurement (study exposure) between January 2010 and February 2013 that follows the COPD medical code and meets the stable state and other inclusion requirements. The 12-month period before the index date will be used to assess demographics, exacerbation and treatment history. The follow up period from index date until censoring date, the earliest of the following events: 1. death, 2. leaving the practice, or 3.end of follow-up on February 28, 2014, will be examined for the occurrence of COPD exacerbations (study outcome).
Descriptive analysis will be conducted. A negative binomial model will be used to examine the association between blood eosinophils and exacerbation rate.

Around 24,000 deaths are attributed to cold weather each year in England and Wales. It was recently recommended that GPs flag patients living in hard to heat homes, but GPs are already over-stretched and do not have the tools to determine which patients are at highest risk. Using three datasets, including CPRD, we will develop a tool to help primary care teams flag people at risk of death or emergency admission to hospital during or just after cold spells. The CPRD dataset comprises over 2 million patients from general practices across Great Britain. We will link the data with information on weather conditions during the period of study to ascertain cold weather spells. We will then use information in CPRD to find out which aspects of people's backgrounds and their medical history predict their risk of dying or going to hospital during or just after a cold weather spell. We will also find out whether people have much contact with primary care before a cold spell, so we can know whether primary care teams have any opportunity to intervene.","Cold weather poses primary care challenges both for prevention and treatment of resulting morbidity. Approximately 24,000 extra deaths occur every winter in England & Wales, chiefly in older people: figures which will rise as the population ages. In March 2015, NICE recommended GPs should flag patients living in cold or hard to heat homes, but GPs currently have neither capacity to visit everyone nor tools to determine those at highest risk. This proposal will address this second issue, to help primary care teams focus resources towards those most likely to benefit. We will use CPRD, linked with Hospital Episode Statistics, to investigate predictors of emergency hospital admission and mortality following cold spells, and examine primary care contacts around such events. We will also link local weather data over the period of follow up to identify cold weather spells. This will allow precise estimation of risks associated with cold weather. We will investigate the degree and nature of contact with primary care during cold spells, both for patients who die or are admitted to hospital within 14 days, and other patients. Prediction equations will be built using a training set (randomly chosen half of the data) and tested in the remainder.","1 - Death (with cause).

Acute worsening events of the disease called acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are often triggered by infection and are associated with airway inflammation. They are one of the main drivers of COPD illness and death. Mepolizumab is a medication which has been shown to help reduce episodes of worsening of asthma, and due to similarities between asthma and COPD it is believed that mepolizumab may also help reduce the frequency of COPD exacerbations. The purpose of this study is to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of COPD patient population types who may have high risk of worsening of COPD and also have high levels of a marker of inflammation, called eosinophils, in their blood, which may indicate they could potentially benefit from  mepolizumab treatment.

COPD patients are at risk of severe episodes of deterioration - 'exacerbations'. Exacerbations are the second commonest cause of adult emergency medical hospital admission in the UK and are associated with shortened lives and decreased quality of life. Changes in temperature, humidity and air pollution are related to exacerbations, but these are not well characterised due, in part, to insufficiently detailed environmental exposure estimates in studies. This study will investigate the role of environmental factors such as pollution and temperature on exacerbations in COPD. This information will be of benefit to both patients and health care providers by helping to improve the organisation of health care resources, particularly in the winter and highlight times when patients should be aware of increased risk of exacerbations.","1. Objectives
	To find evidence supporting the hypothesis that increased levels of common atmospheric pollutants or falls/rises in temperature cause an increased risk and hence incidence of execerbations of COPD.
 
2. Methods
	We will link patient data via General Practices contributing to CPRD to relevant atmospheric data held by DEFRA and BADC. As the best available proxy for environmental data in the locality of a given practice we will use data from the nearest monitoring station, found by translating post codes into British National Grid coordinates.

While healthcare delivery and research has traditionally focused on treatment of individual diseases, the presence of two or more chronic diseases, known as multimorbidity, has become an increasingly common medical issue. Individuals with multimorbidity tend to have more complicated healthcare needs, often leading to increased doctors visits and hospitalisations. The primary aim of this study is to use routinely collected medical record data to describe the prevalence of multimorbidity in English adults. We will examine the percentage of people in a sample of English patients that have multimorbidity, and the association of individual characteristics including age, sex, and ethnicity with multimorbidity. Additionally, we will assess the association of multimorbidity with usage of health services based on a patient's number of GP visits, number of prescriptions, and how often they are admitted to hospital. This work has the potential to benefit patients and health service providers. Through understanding how sociodemographic characteristics impact multimorbidity, we may be able to more appropriately target interventions for multimorbid patients. Additionally, it will allow for better planning and distribution of resources to better care for patients suffering from multimorbidity.","Multimorbidity is becoming increasingly prevalent in England, and the effective management of multimorbid patients should be a priority of primary care medicine. In order to effectively plan health services to treat multimorbid patients, we must understand the epidemiology of this condition, and the current relationship between multimorbidity and health service usage. This research is primarily a descriptive epidemiological study looking at the burden of multimorbidity in primary care in England. It will consist of both a cross-sectional, descriptive study of the prevalence of multimorbidity, and a follow-on retrospective cohort analysis investigating the relationship between multimorbidity and health service utilisation. Using a random of sample of 425,400 patient records, we will describe the prevalence of multimorbidity, and will investigate differences in multimorbidity among various sociodemographic covariate groups. Additionally, we will investigate any linkages between mental and physical comorbidities, and patterns of the most common comorbidities. In the four-year retrospective cohort aspect of our study, we will use regression models to examine how health service utilisation may differ according to the presence of multimorbidity. Our primary outcomes will be the number of GP consultations, the number of prescriptions dispensed, and the number of hospitalisations.","The outcome of our descriptive analysis is the prevalence of multimorbidity, and we will define multimorbidity using a list of 36 comorbidities. In addition to describing the prevalence of multimorbidity, as part of our descriptive analysis we are interested in the pairing and clustering of different comorbidities. To assess the frequency of the most commonly paired comorbidities, our outcome will be pairs of any two separate morbidities from the code list of 36 comorbidities. Additionally, to evaluate our final descriptive outcome relating to the prevalence of physical-mental health comorbidities, mental health comorbidities will be defined as Depression and Anxiety, Alcohol Problems, Dementia, Learning Disability, and Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder.

There is evidence that the number of children with eczema has increased in the last decades. However there is a lack of contemporary estimates of the risk of new cases of eczema in children in the UK. We therefore propose to examine the eczema risk by using routinely collected health information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We will identify children with the onset of eczema under the age of 18 years from the general child population and assess the risk of onset over time and also by child's age, gender and other sociodemographic characters. Children with eczema are often prescribed multiple drugs to manage their condition and they can also develop other allergic conditions such as asthma and food allergy over time. Because of the high disease burden, the high drug prescription rate and the potential link with other allergic conditions, knowing the risk of new cases of eczema in children and how this has changed over time could yield substantial benefits for future health services planning and resource allocation.","In the UK, contemporary estimates of eczema incidence in children are lacking and previous studies have shown inconsistent results due to different ways of measuring eczema. The aim of the project is therefore to assess the incidence of eczema in children in the UK. We will use the HES-linked CPRD records to establish an open cohort of children under the age of 18 years who have a first clinical diagnosis of eczema between April 1997 and March 2015. The study cases will be identified using various combinations of validated clinical diagnosis and treatments (including eczema-related drugs and phototherapy). Dr Abuabara is currently conducting a validation study of eczema diagnostic Read codes using data from The Health Improvement Network (SRC Reference Number: 14-083, Approved 15 January 2015, Study title: Eczema epidemiology and comorbidities). We will calculate crude incidence by dividing the number of cases by the total number of person-years from the HES-linked CPRD population at risk during the study period. We will calculate incidence stratified by age, sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and calendar year. We will also examine how the risk of eczema in children varies by calendar time, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status and ethnicity.",Incidence of eczema in children aged 0-17 years old,"Dr Sonia Gran - Chief Investigator - University of Nottingham

1616632338-1859,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=42,The effect of metformin on patient outcome after acute myocardial infarction,"Coronary heart disease, including heart attacks, remains the biggest cause of death worldwide. It is recognised that promptly opening the blocked coronary artery that causes a heart attack is the best available treatment. However, this therapeutic restoration of blood-flow, in combination with the preceding ischaemia, may contribute to the final heart attack size. As such, this provides an important target for protection against so-called 'ischaemia-reperfusion injury' (IRI).

Several drugs have been targeted at IRI. Recently, several animal studies have suggested that metformin, a medication commonly prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus, may be valuable in this regard. However, randomised clinical trials of metformin administered in advance of a heart attack are not possible given the unpredictable nature of the disease. Furthermore, any beneficial effect remains to be tested in large observational studies.

Examining data from adult patients within the CPRD who have suffered a heart attack, some of who will have been taking metformin at the time, will provide a unique insight into the potential favourable effects of metformin in the context of IRI. If the laboratory data is supported by observational data from the CPRD, it presents a new and exciting opportunity for reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease.","The objective of the proposed research is to investigate the effect of preadmission and subsequent metformin on outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in type 2 diabetics using CPRD data linked with the national audit of myocardial infarction (MINAP), Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data and hospital episode statistics (HES) data through the CALIBER dataset.

This is a prospective cohort study of patients with type 2 diabetes experiencing their first AMI, comparing patients with a prescription of metformin (or metformin and other oral anti-diabetic agents) versus alternative oral anti-diabetic medication without metformin prior to, and after, index AMI. Patients will be compared with respect to primary outcomes of major adverse cardiac events (a composite of cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalisation, and stroke), heart failure and all-cause mortality.

The absolute incidence of AMI, demographic and baseline characteristics of the study population with or without metformin will be compared using the Pearson Chi Square test for categorical variables and Student t test for continuous variables.

We will calculate Kaplan-Meier product limits for cumulative probability of reaching an end point and use the log rank test for evidence of a significant difference between groups. Cox regression analysis will be used to estimate hazard ratios for the effect of metformin in fully adjusted models.","Major adverse cardiac events

This study will investigate the difference between soft mist inhalers and dry powder inhalers as single medications used to treat COPD. How many resources (i.e. visits to the General Practitioner (GP)) these patients use, treatment outcomes (time on therapy, time to change in therapy), and how many health issues (sudden worsening of symptoms, change in lung function) they encounter over the course of their treatment period will be assessed.","This study is a non-interventional cohort study using existing data (CPRD), to gain detailed insights on the characteristics of COPD patients treated with a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or Respimat.

Broken bones as a result of osteoporosis can dramatically affect patients quality of life and also cause a considerable financial cost to the country. However, it is possible to screen and treat people at highest risk of osteoporosis to prevent fractures. We know that inflammation is associated with increased risk of fracture in some conditions because inflammation reduces bone strength. For example, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylosis, inflammatory bowel disease and systemic lupus erythematous have previously been linked with a higher risk of osteoporosis and fracture. However, with improvements in medical treatment in these conditions, the risk of fracture may have reduced. We also do not know if some other common inflammatory conditions, e.g. gout, polymyalgia rheumatica, giant cell arteritis and psoriasis, are linked with a higher risk of fracture. This study will use health records from a large database of UK primary care records to compare the risk of fracture in different inflammatory conditions. This will help clinicians identify and treat patients at highest risk to prevent fractures.","Background: Inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) are known to be associated with increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture. However, previous estimates of fracture risk may be outdated, especially given recent improvements in the management of these conditions. Furthermore, for common inflammatory conditions (polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), giant cell arteritis (GCA), psoriasis and gout) limited epidemiological evidence about fracture risk exists. Primary aim: To estimate the relative effect of selected inflammatory conditions (RA, AS, SLE, IBD, gout, PMR, GCA, psoriasis) on the risk of osteoporosis and fragility fracture. Methods: A retrospective matched cohort study utilizing data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Exposed individuals will be those with diagnoses of RA, AS, SLE, IBD, gout, PMR and psoriasis from 1990-2004. Incidence rates of fragility fracture and osteoporosis over 10 years of follow up will be calculated and compared in each disease group. Expected outputs and future developments: The results will impact on clinical practice by enabling screening to be targeted at those conditions with highest risk and enable accurate fracture risk estimation. The results will be presented at national and international conferences, published in high-impact medical journals, and inform (inter)national clinical guidelines.","Primary outcomes of interest are time from the index date to first diagnosis of fragility fracture up to 10 years post inclusion.

Less than 10% of the patients facing this disease are alive five years after the diagnosis. Limited therapeutic options and particularly tumour detection at an advanced stage due to the lack of early and specific clinical symptoms lead to this dismal prognosis. Therefore, to substantially improve life expectancy, early detection based on lab values in screenings would be helpful. Diabetes mellitus, an early manifestation of pancreatic cancer, represents a decisive clue for selecting patients at significant risk. However, given the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus type II these days, the success of defining a population eligible for screening distinctly depends on the identification of criteria suggesting pancreatic cancer associated diabetes. Hence, our aim is to characterise pancreatic cancer patients with regard to previously recorded hyperglycaemia indicative of diabetes. We will assess in particular temporal changes in blood glucose and in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels as well as in body weight prior to the cancer diagnosis as potentially important factors for differentiation.","While new-onset diabetes mellitus can be a symptom of pancreatic cancer, only 1% of diabetic patients will develop the disease within 3 years after diabetes detection. Using a case-control design, we intend to characterise 30-89 years old patients with a first-time pancreatic cancer diagnosis and a matched comparison group without pancreatic cancer focusing particularly on their hyperglycaemia history. We will assess the timing of hyperglycaemia onset (</= or > 2 years prior to the cancer diagnosis) and the temporal pattern of blood glucose and HbA1c values up to 5 years prior to the cancer diagnosis or the corresponding date in the controls. We will classify blood glucose and HbA1c values into quartiles or into a priori defined categories of low, normal or high levels, and we will evaluate whether different categories are differentially associated with pancreatic cancer performing conditional logistic regression analysis. We will further compare body weight and BMI in hyperglycaemic pancreatic cancer and in control patients.

It is characterised by unexplained, persistent, and sometimes debilitating fatigue. There is an extensive literature on diagnostic criteria and the symptoms of CFS, and fatigue syndromes in general, but far fewer studies have investigated the risk of death from specific causes. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether patients with CFS are at increased risk of dying prematurely compared to the UK general population. Our principal aim is to test the hypothesis that suicide risk is elevated in patients diagnosed with CFS. We are also interested in whether the same findings apply to patients diagnosed with other fatigue syndromes. Previous studies on this topic have produced contradictory findings, and did not involve a sufficient number of patients to adequately answer these questions. As such, this study has the potential to generate the most compelling evidence to date that patients diagnosed with CFS should be screened for major depression and, in serious persistent cases, a psychiatric assessment of suicidality undertaken by a mental health professional.","Our principal aim is to investigate whether patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) / myalgic encephalopathy (ME) are at an increased risk of all-cause mortality, unnatural death (including suicide), and non-fatal self-harm.

Adult patients with a Read coded diagnosis of CFS between 01/01/2000 and 31/12/2014 and enrolled in a CPRD-contributing practice with relevant linkage, will be matched (on age, gender, and practice) with 20 unaffected comparison patients. Selection will be restricted to patients registered with a contributing practice for at least one year and follow-up will end when the patient either dies, transfers out of the practice, last data collection, or the study period ends on 31/12/2014. Causes of death will be defined according to ICD-10 classifications. Cox regressions will be used to investigate whether patients with CFS have elevated all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks. Hazard ratios (HRs) will be generated with and without adjustments for potential confounders. Adjustments will be made for area-level deprivation, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status. We will then apply the same process and investigate whether our findings also apply to patients diagnosed with other forms of fatigue syndrome including post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) or an asthenia.","All-cause mortality

It is presumed that especially long-term use and high daily doses of corticosteroids tablets are the driving force behind the development of such undesired effects. Corticosteroids tablets are a mainstay treatment for severe asthma (an illness that makes breathing difficult), but the risk of developing such undesired effects has not been quantified in asthma patients specifically, where patients may take corticosteroids tablets on a short term basis for acute asthma attacks continuously in severe asthma which cannot be controlled by other drugs.

Given that diabetes and obesity are preventable, and that a substantial part of obesity is now established at younger ages, our study will aim to uncover trends of diabetes and obesity and diabetes-related health outcomes among children and young adults. Such findings  provide important evidence for understanding risk starting early in life, identifying potential ages for targeted interventions, and whether or not there are any differences in disease development between boys and girls.

A secondary aim is to extend the analysis to up to five years before the transplanted kidney stops working. 
It is expected that the total annual healthcare costs will be higher in the final year before the transplant stops working compared with previous years. This is in agreement with other studies where the costs in the last year before important medical events have occurred have risen substantially. 
The study will provide a detailed understanding of the long-term use of healthcare resources and their costs of kidney transplant patients. It can also be used to show how costs of liver transplant patients change during the years before the kidney transplant stops working and whether these costs increase the nearer to the time the kidney stops working. 
These costs can be input into economic studies where different treatments, used to maintain transplanted kidneys functioning, are compared. Traditionally, little attention has been paid to the assumption that annual costs may change the nearer to the time when the kidney transplant stops working.","The primary objective of this study is the total cost of healthcare resource use observed in the year prior to the date of kidney transplant failure.

It usually presents in mid-life (mean age of onset in the UK is 52 years).  Death usually occurs between 10 and 20 years after the onset of symptoms.

The underlying biochemical basis of HD suggests that the genetic abnormality may provide protection against cancer.  Indeed, several previous studies have suggested that patients with HD are substantially less likely to be diagnosed with malignant disease than those without HD.  The difficulty in interpreting these studies is that the HD populations all had symptomatic (diagnosed) disease.  It is possible that symptomatic patients with HD either fail to present with symptoms suggestive of malignancy; or, if they do, their healthcare professionals fail to investigate them because of their poor health and/or prognosis.

In the proposed study we plan to investigate the frequency of diagnoses of cancer in patients who have already been diagnosed with symptomatic HD as well as in those who have yet to have their HD diagnosed both compared to appropriately matched controls","HD is an autosomal dominant condition usually presenting in mid-life.   It is due to an expanded CAG repeat on the short arm of chromosome 4.  As a consequence the gene product, an abnormal form of the protein huntingtin, has an expanded polyglutamine tract that accumulates in neuronal cells and causes cell death.  

It has been postulated that the mutant HD gene product protects against malignant disease and previous studies (Sorensen and Fenger 1992, 1999; Ji et al 2012) have claimed to show this. These studies, however, were conducted in people with symptomatic HD and it is possible that such patients either failed to present with relevant symptoms; or that their healthcare professionals failed to investigate them because of their poor state of health and/or their poor prognosis. 

We plan to undertake a two phase study of the frequency of cancer diagnoses among both symptomatic, and presymptomatic, patients with HD compared with the frequency of cancer diagnoses in matched controls.  By examining the frequency of cancer in symptomatic HD patients it should be possible to confirm or refute the previous evidence suggesting a reduced frequency of malignant disease in patients with diagnosed HD.   By examining the frequency of malignancy in presymptomatic HD patients, compared to controls, we hope to avoid the potential diagnostic bias that may have affected previous studies among those with manifest HD.","An incident cancer diagnosis

In considering reasons for this, it is natural to consider the potential influence of factors related to general practices where these people are registered. Sometimes the way practices are organised lead to their patients needing unplanned care from hospitals when they fall ill. In particular, we wish to determine whether having continuity of care (usually seeing the same doctor) can reduce the risk of having an unplanned hospital admission. We will use data from the CPRD, linked to ""Hospital Episode Statistics"" (HES), which tell us about patients' stays in hospital.

This current pilot project will investigate whether the linked CPRD/HES data contains the right sort of information to answer our question. We will investigate data suitable for assessing continuity of care received by individual patients, and also the data which relate to emergency admissions and A&E attendance. In the present project, we will only assess data on 10,000 patients aged over 65. If the data do seem suitable, we will seek funding to carry out an analysis on the full CPRD dataset.","Evidence suggests that many NHS patients presenting for unscheduled secondary care could be managed in primary care, thus aspects of general practice might be associated with unscheduled care. Current work by the investigators, including a published systematic review, suggest continuity of care as a potential influence.

We will obtain data from CPRD, linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data concerning emergency hospital admissions in 2012-14. Our ultimate purpose is to examine whether better continuity of care (as defined by a ready-made index) is associated with fewer emergency admissions, after adjustment for relevant confounding factors. The purpose of the current proposal will be to investigate the suitability of the data to address this hypothesis. We will request data on 10,000 patients aged over 65: while this will not have sufficient power to address the ultimate hypothesis, it will allow us to estimate the emergency admission rate, and assess its concordance with official national averages. We will assess agreement between both emergency admissions and ED attendances apparent in GP records, and those recorded in HES and will investigate disagreement, especially concerning mode of referral and discharge. Emergency admissions will be our primary outcome, however we will investigate ED attendances recorded by GPs.",Emergency admission to hospital,"Professor Richard Morris - Chief Investigator - University of Bristol

CVD prevention programmes have been implemented in England and Scotland with the aim of reducing the burden of CVD and other diseases such as diabetes, and reducing related health inequalities, but there is a lack of strong evidence that such programmes are effective. The two programmes have a number of similarities and differences in their aims, organisation, duration, the age range they target, and what they include. This research study aims to use CPRD data, which covers both countries, to demonstrate the similarities and the differences between the NHS Health Check CVD prevention programme in England and the Keep Well programme in Scotland. We will compare the programmes in terms of their attendance rate and the proportion of the population covered. We will also report the differences and changes in the population level of risk of developing CVD in future, and also the levels of individual risk factors for CVD (high blood pressure, high body weight, high cholesterol and smoking), and prescribing of statin drugs to people found to be at high risk.","The main objective is to compare the English NHS Health Check programme and the Scottish Keep Well programme in terms of their coverage in the eligible population, global CVD risk and risk factor prevalence, and statin prescribing. We will quantify the population eligible for a health check from individuals aged 40-74 between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2013 for the English programme, and from individuals aged 45-64 years between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2013 for the Scottish population. 

We will calculate and assess equities in coverage using a multilevel logistic regression model and compare them between the two countries using chi-square tests, or by including an interaction term into the regression model (aim 1).

A secondary aim is to extend the analysis to up to five years before the transplanted liver stops working. 
It is expected that the total annual healthcare costs will be higher in the final year before the transplant stops working compared with previous years. This is in agreement with other studies where the costs in the last year before important medical events have occurred have risen substantially. 
The study will provide a detailed understanding of the long-term use of healthcare resources and their costs of liver transplant patients. It can also be used to show how costs of liver transplant patients change during the years before the liver transplant stops working and whether these costs increase the nearer to the time the liver stops working. 
These costs can be input into economic studies where different treatments, used to maintain transplanted livers functioning, are compared. Traditionally, little attention has been paid to the assumption that annual costs may change the nearer to the time when the liver transplant stops working.","The primary objective of this study is the total cost of healthcare resource use observed in the year prior to the date of liver transplant failure.  A secondary aim is to extend the analysis to between more than one and five years before graft failure.
This project will constitute a non-interventional, retrospective longitudinal study to analyse anonymous patient data from NHS databases. Patients will be selected from the CPRD/HES on the basis of evidence for liver transplantation between 2004 and 2013 and graft failure between 2005 and 2014.
Costs will be evaluated through models which are based on NHS national costs (2015) for health care consumption and BNF costs for drug utilisation.
The total cost of healthcare resource in the year prior to the graft failure will be analysed descriptively, in terms of distribution of costs, components of total cost and the relationship between individual resource items and total cost.
Continuous and nominal variables will be described using standard statistical measures such as number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value, median, 1st and 3rd quartiles, and frequencies.

When immune cells destroy the myelin layer covering the connecting links between the nerve cells (i.e. axons), the nerves can no longer transmit signals efficiently, leading to the inability of the muscles to respond to the brain's commands. In rare cases this can become life threatening by interference with breathing, blood pressure or heart rate.
GBS is rare, afflicting roughly one person in 100,000, affecting men slightly more frequently than women, and becoming more frequent with increasing age. Usually GBS occurs after the patient suffered from a viral or bacterial infection, although in rare occasions vaccination may precede GBS. 
The objective of this study is to estimate incidence rates of GBS in the UK population based on anonymised data in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, between April 1st, 2005 and March 31st, 2015, by six-month months periods from April to September, and October to March. This study will thus provide a baseline frequency of GBS in the population to shed light on seasonal winter to summer variations in GBS occurrence, and help evaluate potential safety signals of health interventions, including medicines or vaccines.","Knowledge of background incidence rates in the general population is key to assess adverse events suspected to be associated with health interventions. As the seasonality of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is not well understood, large epidemiological databases are a potential resource to better understand rates and seasonal variations of GBS.

The objective of this study is to determine the incidence rates and seasonality of GBS in the UK general population.
This is a cohort database study based on the number of cases of GBS and total person-time at risk from April 2005 to March 2015 in the UK CPRD and inpatient HES.
Person-time at risk will be calculated for all subjects with censoring applied at the time of death, date of diagnosis, disenrollment from the medical practice or last collection date.
Cases of GBS are defined as those subjects for whom an incident event of GBS was recorded using READ or ICD-10 diagnostic codes.

1616632317-1851,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=43,Evidence for and implications of channeling in the use of nonprescription acetaminophen and ibuprofen in an electronic medical records database,"Previous studies have found evidence suggesting paracetamol, as compared to ibuprofen, increases the risk of several health conditions, namely stomach ulcers, heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and death.  Given an apparent relationship between paracetamol and subsequent adverse health events, one question is whether paracetamol causes these conditions or whether it reflects the characteristics of patients before getting the drug. An important possible reason for the latter pattern occurs when patients are either much more or much less likely to be prescribed certain medications because of a pre-existing health condition.  An existing health condition may cause physicians not to prescribe a medication because of side effects that have been associated with the condition.  For example, people with a stomach ulcer might not be prescribed ibuprofen because it can cause stomach bleeding and they are already at risk.  Instead, they would get acetaminophen if needed for mild pain and would likely continue to be treated for their ulcer.  Then the use of acetaminophen would appear to be related to subsequent stomach ulcer, too. The objective of this study is to determine whether there is evidence of physician prescribing for paracetamol versus ibuprofen in a medical records database based on pre-existing conditions.","Previous studies have found an association between paracetamol and several adverse events, including upper gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke, acute renal failure and death. Some of these studies used ibuprofen as a comparator1,2 and when discussing the results it was common to raise the question of channeling but rare to offer evidence.  Given an association is identified and is reproducible; the question is whether it is causal or reflects bias.   One important candidate for a possible source of bias is channeling.  

The primary objective is to determine whether there is channeling bias in the first prescription of paracetamol vs. ibuprofen in an electronic medical records database.  A second objective is to repeat the analysis using negative control conditions as a way of calibrating the amount of residual variation inherent in the data source or study design.  A third objective is to assess the prospects to reliably control for bias through adjustment methods.   The findings would have bearing on any studies that compare adverse event rates among subjects exposed to paracetamol and subjects exposed to ibuprofen.    

We will use the CPRD to form a cohort of patients given a first prescription of single-ingredient paracetamol or ibuprofen.  Frequencies of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke, ant acute renal failure, each in turn, will be calculated to determine whether channeling was present.  In validation, we will examine frequencies of prior diagnoses of approximately 36 negative control conditions which are known not to be associated with use of paracetamol versus ibuprofen.  Additionally, a propensity score analysis will be performed to determine the proportion of overlap of factors that predict first prescription of paracetamol or ibuprofen.",First prescription of either paracetamol or ibuprofen,"Dr Rachel Weinstein - Chief Investigator - Johnson & Johnson ( JnJ - USA )

It is a rare type of one-sided headache, where pain is focussed around the eye; headaches occur in episodic attacks or clusters which last between 15 minutes and 3 hours. Attacks occur daily and bouts may last weeks or months, they most frequently occur in spring and autumn. Some patients experience chronic cluster headache, with very short (less than one month) breaks from attacks, whereas other patients may have months or years between attacks. Cluster headache occurs more commonly in men than women, and it also tends to first occur in adulthood. There are few effective treatments available for cluster headache.

These complex features of cluster headache and its rarity mean that descriptive epidemiological information from large populations is not readily available. This study will count the number of adults and children with cluster headache and examine the treatment they are prescribed to prevent cluster headache attacks. This information will be used by Lilly to support the development of a new medicine for prevention of cluster headache. Thus it is important to public health as there are few available effective treatments to prevent cluster headache attacks.","Cluster headache (CH) is a rare and disabling primary headache disorder characterized by episodic attacks of intense unilateral headache and autonomic symptoms. Cluster periods are separated by attack-free remissions of variable duration, lasting from weeks to years. The average age of onset is 20-40 years and there is a strong male predominance.  The rarity of CH, the severity of the illness and the varying patterns of bouts mean that reported estimates of disease prevalence lack precision. The primary objective of this study is to determine a prevalence estimate of cluster headache in adults and children, and to describe the characteristics of CH patients.

Lilly is developing a Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide neutralising Antibody (CGRP Ab) for the preventive treatment of CH. Preventive treatment is initiated at the onset of a cluster period but aimed at reducing the overall number of cluster attacks during the cluster period.  This analysis will also examine the prevalence of use of CH treatments, with a focus on preventive treatments. This data will be used to provide epidemiological data for submission to regulatory authorities.","First record of cluster headache

Glucose-lowering treatments which were not licensed at the time of the guideline publication included three dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and three sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. These drugs have been widely prescribed despite not yet being included in the treatment pathway in the guideline. The primary objective is to understand how DPP-4 and SGLT2 inhibitors have been prescribed to patients with T2DM in the absence of an up-to-date clinical guideline. Kidney impairment is one of the most common complications amongst patients with T2DM. Treating these patients can be challenging as many glucose-lowering therapies are not recommended for them. DPP-4 inhibitors are licensed to treat patients with kidney impairment however each DPP-4 inhibitor comes with its specific criterion for dose reduction. The complexity of the dosage could potentially increase the risk of patients being treated with an inappropriate dose. The second objective is to describe the drugs and doses of DPP-4 inhibitors prescribed to T2DM patients with kidney impairment.,"The primary objective of this study is to understand the usage of newer agents for the treatment of T2DM, namely DPP-4 and SGLT2 inhibitors by describing demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who have been prescribed the medications. Subsequently, medications and doses of DPP-4 inhibitors prescribed to patients with kidney impairment will be analysed. The method of research will be a descriptive cohort. Patients who have had a prescription for DPP-4 or SGLT2 and were  40 years  or older when T2DM was diagnosed will form two study cohorts (i.e., DPP-4 population and SGLT2 population). Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who have been treated with either class of glucose-lowering medications. As a subset of the DPP-4 cohort, patients with moderate to severe kidney impairment will form a second part of the study. The medications and doses/dosage of DPP-4 inhibitors prescribed to this patient population will be described.","The outcomes of the first objective are the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who had a prescription for a DPP-4 or SGLT2 inhibitor.

IA affects the immune system and causes pain, stiffness and joint damage. The most common forms of IA are rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PSA). Osteoporosis weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. Fragility fractures (fractures that occur from standing height or less) can cause substantial pain, severe disability, reduced quality of life and reduced life expectancy. Studies suggest that patients with RA or AS have an increased risk of osteoporosis and fragility fracture. There is a lack of evidence on PSA and fragility fractures and on the relationship between IA and risk of fracture by age, sex, ethnicity and glucocorticoid use. Glucocorticoid is an anti-inflammatory medicine (commonly called ""steroids"").

Prevention of fragility fracture is possible but needs to be targeted at those at highest risk.  Clearer guidance on who to assess and treat is needed. This study seeks evidence to enable prevention of fragility fractures to be targeted at, and provided with equity to, patients with IA who will benefit most. It examines who is at risk of fragility fractures and who receives pre and post fracture treatment for osteoporosis.","Objective

COPD patients are at risk of severe episodes of deterioration - 'exacerbations'. Exacerbations are the second commonest cause of adult emergency medical hospital admission in the UK and are associated with shortened lives and decreased quality of life. There are several interventions that can help to improve quality of life in people with COPD and may help to reduce exacerbations and health care utilisation and cost associated with exacerbations. One of these interventions is called pulmonary rehabilitation. Pulmonary rehabilitation requires people with COPD to attend an exercise and education class once or twice a week over a 4 to 6 week period. While many studies have investigated the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on individual patients, whole systems cost effectiveness studies are less common. This study will help us to understand potential cost savings in terms of COPD exacerbation reductions when pulmonary rehabilitation is maximally utilised for people with COPD.","As a national sample of current practice, we will use linked CPRD GOLD data with HES and ONS to undertake a cohort study followed by a regression analysis.

A single tablet containing amlodipine and telmisartan and another containing amlodipine and bisoprolol are proposed as substitute therapies for high blood pressure in patients already treated with either pair of medicines as individual tablets at the same dose. Combined tablets reduce the number of tablets taken daily and the effort involved for the patient in managing their tablets. The aim of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of telmisartan/amlodipine and bisoprolol/amlodipine when taken together. 
Patients with high blood pressure prescribed telmisartan, bisoprolol or amlodipine at a stable dose, who are then prescribed one of the other medicines (amlodipine followed by telmisartan or bisoprolol; telmisartan or bisoprolol followed by amlodipine) will be identified from CPRD. Change in blood pressure will be investigated at 30-150 days and 90-270 days after the addition of the second medicine.

Poor glucose control is in turn associated with development of cardiovascular complications, further increasing the burden of the disease. Therefore, it is important to effectively manage high glucose levels, and to do so in a timely manner. The treatment guidelines recommend intensifying treatment with other oral and/or injectable diabetes medications among patients with poor glucose control. However, a recent study found that half of the patients with elevated glucose levels did not receive treatment intensification for over a year, suggesting that patients may be subject to prolonged periods of poor diabetes control. This study expands upon the prior research by assessing time to treatment intensification among those who do not achieve adequate glucose control with one diabetes therapy and assessing characteristics of patients stratified by time to treatment intensification. In addition, the study will evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes associated with different times of intensifying treatment.","The proposed study will assess time to treatment intensification among T2DM patients not achieving adequate glycemic control with metformin or sulfonylurea alone (defined as first glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] measurement 7% or less after at least 3 months of metformin or sulfonylurea use) using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. In addition, the study aims to describe the characteristics of patients receiving early intensification, intermediate intensification, or late intensification after initial indication of monotherapy failure. The precise definitions for these stratifications will be determined based on the distribution of time to intensification observed within the study sample to reflect the treatment patterns in the UK population. Furthermore, time to attaining HbA1c levels <7% will be described for those with early versus intermediate and early versus late intensification using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Finally, for a subgroup of patients with linked hospital data available, the association between differential times to treatment intensification and incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications will be assessed using Cox proportional hazards models.","Time to treatment intensification

Alcohol misuse is increasing among young people and is a potentially important risk factor for injuries in young people. Existing studies investigating alcohol as a risk factor for injury are often small and rely on information reported by young people themselves. Additionally, little is known about the association between alcohol misuse and the types of injuries (e.g. falls, road traffic incidents) young people sustain, which is important when developing injury prevention programmes. By using the linked primary care and hospital admission records of young people aged 10-24 we aim to assess whether young people admitted to hospital as a result of alcohol misuse have an increased risk of injury compared to young people who haven't been admitted to hospital as a result of alcohol misuse. We will identify the most common injuries that young people sustain following a hospital admission for alcohol misuse with the aim of informing future injury prevention programmes.","Injuries are the leading cause of mortality among young people within the UK, leading to large numbers of hospital admissions every year. Existing studies assessing health outcomes of hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption are often limited by small sample sizes, being cross-sectional, and relying on self-reported alcohol intake and outcome information. There are few population-based studies of alcohol-related health outcomes among young people; none using linked primary and secondary care data in the UK. Using a cohort aged 10-24 with linked CPRD and inpatient HES data, for the period 1997-2014, we will assess whether young people with an alcohol-specific hospital admission have a higher risk of injury than controls. We will match up to 10 controls (without an alcohol-specific hospital admission between age 10-24) per case on age and general practice. We will estimate incidence rates, unadjusted and adjusted hazard rate ratios of injury and 95% confidence intervals using Cox regression to compare those with and without an alcohol-specific hospital admission. Age, sex, region, calendar year and socioeconomic status will be investigated as potential confounders. A greater understanding of injury consequences among young people who misuse alcohol will help develop more targeted and evidence based prevention and harm minimisation programmes.","Injuries overall, and specifically hospitalised injuries, classifying injuries according to the injury type (e.g. fracture, burn), mechanism (e.g. falls, road traffic incidents) and intent (e.g. unintentional, self-harm, assault) of injury","Elizabeth Orton - Chief Investigator - University Of Nottingham

They have been found to prevent the development of a certain type of brain tumour, the so-called glioma, in experiments performed on cells. Whether these drugs also may reduce the likelihood of glioma developing in humans is unknown. 
We propose to conduct a study using the U.K.-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to compare use of these pain reducing drugs among patients with a glioma diagnosis and among patients without a diagnosis of glioma. Patients with glioma will be individuals younger than 90 years of age with a first-time diagnosis of glioma between 1995 and 2015. We will identify ten patients without glioma from the same general practice and compare these patients to those with a diagnosis of glioma.  Patients without glioma will be of the same age, sex and have been registered for the same number of years at the practice.","We propose to conduct a 1:10 matched case-control analysis using the CPRD to test the hypothesis that use of COX-2 inhibitors is associated with decreased risk of glioma. We will conduct conditional logistic regression analyses to determine relative risks, estimated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of glioma in relation to use of COX-2 inhibitors. Analyses will be adjusted for various potential confounding variables and only variables altering the risk of glioma by >10% will be included in the final multivariate analysis. The effects of exposure to COX-2 inhibitors will be compared to the effects of other non-selective NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin) and non-NSAID analgesics (paracetamol, opioids).

The study will use information from the Clinical Research Practice Database (CPRD) to determine how CPD has been treated in the UK for at least the past 10 years. The researchers will review the records of children treated for CPD to determine which drugs they have been prescribed and the time over which they have been treated. Since CPD may not always be captured as a specific presciption reason, researchers will also review records for all children treated with GB via the oral route to determine when each prescription formulation should be used and at what dose. In addition, the records will be reviewed for GB use  via intramuscular and intravenous routes, since CPD is known to be an indication via these routes. The information will be used to address the specific licence application questions and a scientific publication will be written describing the treatment of CPD in UK. The information available in the CPRD will help to bring a much needed, licensed medical treatment to children affected by this condition.","The proposed research aims to analyse the use of glycopyrronium bromide (GB) in paediatric prescribing for sialorrhoea (CPD) in children below the age of 18 years in the UK.

The overlap of the dataset will allow the sponsor to determine the pattern of prescribing of GB for sialorrhoea in the community. This will in turn be used to estimate UK wide use of GB in the community setting as related to the information available in the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) database.

Whilst initially patients may control their blood sugar by lifestyle modification (diet and exercise), ultimately most will require therapeutic intervention with regimens that increase in complexity as T2DM progresses.  Exenatide is a relatively recent anti-diabetic drug which is known to lead to weight loss as well as improved blood glucose control. It has also been associated with reduced heart attacks and strokes. In this study we wish to use the CPRD database to compare outcomes for patients prescribed exenatide QW (Bydureon) compared with those prescribed basal insulin; a more established treatment for T2DM. In particular we wish to look at blood sugar control and weight change as the primary outcomes but also consider other outcomes: death, heart attacks and strokes. As the choice to treat with exenatide QW or insulin will be related to patient characteristics which may in themselves be associated with the outcomes of the study we aim to match study patients on some of these key variables and adjust for others in our analysis.","We wish to compare outcomes for T2DM patients treated with therapeutic regimens involving exenatide QW with those involving basal insulin-based therapies. T2DM patients will be selected from the CPRD GOLD, HES and ONS datasets. Those identified as being initiated on the target therapies between 2009 and 2014 will be extracted and their characteristics described. We will then match exenatide QW patients (cases) to basal insulin patients (controls) on key characteristics. For the primary objectives we wish to compare change in HbA1c and change in weight independently and as combined endpoints based on patients achieving a fall in HbA1c below 7.0%  accompanied with a) any weight loss and b) weight loss of >/= 5% of baseline.  Secondary objectives are to compare cost of primary and secondary care resource use,  time to all-cause mortality and time to cardiovascular events.

RAS blocking agents are used to treat high blood pressure and congestive heart failure and also reduce protein loss through the urine in certain kidney disorders. RAS blocking agents fall into three classes: angiotensin-II receptor antagonists (ARBs, sometimes known as sartans), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and direct renin inhibitors (aliskiren is the only direct renin inhibitor currently marketed in the UK).
In May 2014, an EU review concluded that combined use of medicines from two classes of RAS blocking agents is not recommended. Studies have shown that combination use is associated with an increased risk of elevated blood potassium levels, low blood pressure and impaired kidney function compared with using either class of RAS agent alone. No significant benefits of combination use were seen in patients who did not have heart failure.
In June 2014, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) published warnings of the risks associated with combined use of different classes of RAS blockers. The study aims to assess the impact that regulatory advice had on the prescribing of RAS blocking agents in UK primary care.","The objective of this study is to assess the outcome of regulatory advice issued by the MHRA in June 2014 in terms of the change in prescribing trends of RAS blocking agents in UK primary care. The drug utilisation study will utilise a retrospective cohort study design in a population of patients prescribed a RAS blocking agent between 01/01/2009 and 30/06/2015. The primary analysis will calculate the trends in prescribing before and after the publication of prescribing advice according to combination prescriptions of RAS blockers from different classes made on the same day. A sensitivity analysis will also look at combination prescriptions, which were made on different days within various time windows. The proportion of combination prescriptions which are prevalent (i.e. were already being prescribed prior to the publication of the new advice) and those which are incident (i.e. new combinations following the publication of the new advice) will also be calculated. Changes in the prescribing of RAS blockers in general will also be assessed as will the proportion of patients who have a prior record of heart failure or diabetic nephropathy in their medical history.","Prescribing of RAS blocking agents

Evidence accumulated on the safety profile of NSAIDs in the last decade has led to the development of guidelines and recommendations for use in recent years, which may have influenced changes in the characteristics of NSAID users and in the patterns of NSAID use.

Even though NSAIDs are widely used, there are gaps in the knowledge of utilization and treatment patterns of these medications. The influence of demographic characteristics like age and sex, comorbidities, and indications on the selection of and treatment with NSAIDs is unclear. Information on switching between doses and NSAIDs and the duration of treatment is limited.

The overall goal of this study is to describe the characteristics of users and the usage pattern of selected systemic NSAIDs including diclofenac using the most recent information available from select population-based health care automated databases in Europe and North America.

The study protocol has been registered with the European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP) and the number assigned to the study is ENCEPP/SDPP/10649.","The study aims to accomplish the following:
- Describe demographic characteristics, specific comorbidities, selected comedications, and selected potential indications for use among patients treated with selected systemic NSAIDs (including diclofenac)
- Describe treatment patterns, including dose, duration of treatment, and switching patterns, among patients treated with selected systemic NSAIDs (including diclofenac)

This will be a non-interventional, retrospective drug utilization study, using a cohort design, of users of selected systemic NSAIDs. Cohorts of prevalent users of selected systemic NSAIDs will be characterized at baseline according to age, sex, prior specific comorbidities, selected comedications, and health care resource use. 

A subset cohort of new users of each selected NSAID will be characterized (1) at baseline according to age, sex, prior specific comorbidities, selected comedications, health care resource use, and selected potential indication; and (2) during the 1-year follow-up period to assess the pattern of use of the NSAID including duration, dose, use of more than one NSAID, switching, and persistence and adherence to therapy.
All study measures will be analyzed descriptively through the tabular and graphical display of mean values, medians, ranges, and standard deviations for continuous variables of interest and proportions for categorical variables (with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, as appropriate).",Prevalent and new NSAID users,"Elena Rivero Ferrer - Chief Investigator - RTI Health Solutions

However, at the same time one has to be very careful with such medical treatments as many blood pressure medications may also be harmful for the unborn child. Unfortunately it is very hard to carry out standard clinical trials on pregnant women and therefore the relation between hypertension and hypertensive treatment options for childbearing women has not been studied as well as one would expect.   This study will give us the possibility to look back and study the medications that the women were taking while pregnant and hopefully find patterns indicating which drug or drug classes may be least harmful to the child.","Research is needed to assess the use of antihypertensive medication among adult females of child bearing age, under real world circumstances.  Earlier studies have been unable to stratify anti-hypertensive medications sufficiently to truly assess foetal outcomes and health risks per drug class, Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists/Blockers (ARBs) and Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) in particular. We will attempt to describe the prescription rate of ARBs and ACE inhibitors among women with very high blood pressure, plus other co-morbid conditions, in the United Kingdom (UK) and estimate the risk of serious foetal outcomes among live births.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate serious adverse fetal outcomes (diagnoses of congenital malformation in live births or post-partum infant death) in women treated with anti-hypertensive medication, more specifically, Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists/Blockers (ARBs) and Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors). Women who are hypertensive and pregnant will be included in the study the study period start will be from January 1, 1997 until December 31, 2014.  

Where possible, each mother will be linked to data records relating to their newborn to allow analysis of adverse fetal outcomes.  These outcomes will be obtained from the following sources, UK primary care data (CPRD GOLD), inpatient hospital episode statistics (HES) and Office of National Statistics (ONS) mortality data, to attempt to build a full picture of what may occur to a child when exposed to anti-hypertensive medication while in the womb. However, not all data sources will contain information on every baby identified in the cohort therefore we may have to tailor the analyses based on complete cohort size. 

Although the overarching goal is to look at the impact of anti-hypertensive medication during pregnancy, other factors relating to the mothers health and circumstances such as, pre-existing diabetes or heart failure, weight and age at pregnancy start, smoking, and socio-economic status, will also be analysed in order to better understand the mother's risk profile impacting adverse fetal outcomes.","Congenital malformation in live births

This can cause damage to healthy tissue, and can affect any of the body's systems such as inflammation of the skin in psoriasis or inflammation of the joints in rheumatoid arthritis.  It has been suggested that in patients who suffer conditions such as these, the effect of persistent inflammation can cause more widespread harm, and has been linked to cardiovascular disease, cancer and death from a number of causes.  
This study aims to investigate the associations between inflammatory conditions of different body systems and onset of, or death from serious diseases. Using the anonymised detailed medical records kept by GPs, we will compare the risks of developing or dying from serious diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, in people who have inflammatory diseases with people of the same age and gender but who don't have an inflammatory disease. This is important in order to improve the health of patients with inflammatory conditions, by identifying those most at risk, establishing how best to manage these risks, and targeting preventable outcomes.","Background: Systemic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psoriasis are known to be associated with increased risk of a variety of adverse health events, such as cardiovascular disease, strokes, cancer and death.  Observational studies examining outcomes in patients with inflammatory conditions are limited, and comparison of the risks between diseases has not been possible.  
Primary aim: To estimate the relative effect of systemic inflammatory conditions on the risk of serious adverse health outcomes such as myocardial infarction (MI), venous thromboembolism (VTE), cancer, infection or death.  

Methods: A retrospective matched cohort study utilizing data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Exposed individuals will be those with diagnoses of systemic inflammatory diseases (SID) from 1998-2003. Incidence rates of outcomes of interest will be calculated and compared in each disease group.","Incidence of;

It occurs when someone dies with epilepsy dies without an obvious explanation. SUDEP is estimated to occur in 1 out of every 1000 people with epilepsy. 

The mechanism of SUDEP has also yet to be understood. It is thought that some combination of sudden changes in the breathing pattern, heart rhythm, and 'shutdown' of normal brain rhythms all contribute to SUDEP. These abnormalities typically occur after a seizure.

Serotonin, an important chemical found in the brain, may be able to reverse these processes. It has been shown to increase wakefulness and breathing in animal models. Furthermore, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to reduce abnormal breathing following seizures in animals. 

Hence, there is a belief that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a type of medication that increases the amount of serotonin available to the brain, may improve mortality in people with epilepsy by improving breathing and vigilance following a seizure. We therefore propose to study this in a large pre-existing dataset to determine if concurrent use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in patients with epilepsy is associated with a lower risk of death.","The objective of this study determine whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) use is associated with decreased mortality in patients with epilepsy. 

Data will be extracted from the CALIBER database that links electronic medical records and administrative data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics, the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project, and the Office of National Statistics. We will extract an epilepsy cohort using a previously validated case definition. Data will then be provided to the analyst by the CALIBER data manager in a secure network in text files that can be directly uploaded to the statistical packages for further analysis.

We will approach the problem using two different analysis plans. First, we will use Cox proportional survival analysis to follow patients forward from the point of SSRI prescription to last follow-up or death. The hazard of death will be compared between those receiving SSRIs to those who are not.  Second, we will perform an analysis using by identifying all patients with epilepsy and comparing them to a control group without epilepsy. We will evaluate those who died of sudden death in each group and compare SSRI use in between populations over the final 6 months.","The primary outcome of interest is overall all-cause death. We will restrict the outcome to sudden death in a sensitivity analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, the group will be composed of an amalgam of primary and secondary codes for sudden death and for sudden cardiac death.

This was based on patients diagnosed with psoriasis between 1987 and 2002. We wish to repeat this study using more recent data and also to consider patients with two related conditions, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. There is evidence that these conditions may also have an association with depression. To carry out this study we will broadly follow the methods used in the original paper, selecting patients with any of the three conditions and matching each patient with five other patients of the same sex and similar age who do not have these conditions but attend the same practice.

In September 2013, Zostavax was launched in the UK to immunise people between 70 and 79 years old. The UK is the first European country to introduce the shingles vaccine as part of its national immunisation programme. 
The shingles vaccine has been routinely offered between September 2014 and September 2015 to people who are 70, 78 or 79 years old (as of 1st September 2014).

The purpose of this questionnaire based observational study is to find out how patients in the UK take their decision to have the shingles vaccination or not. This study will be conducted in the UK and will include roughly 500 patients who are 80 years old, from around 60 practices. Data will be collected using self-administered paper questionnaires completed by the patients and their General Practitioners (GP)  and made anonymous.
The information from this study will help to understand the perceived benefits/barriers of shingles vaccination from patients' point of view. Apart from vaccine efficacy/effectiveness and vaccine safety, the patient acceptability is key for the success of a new vaccination program. Health Authorities are monitoring both the effectiveness/impact and safety of the UK shingles program. With this study we aim to better understand how patients in the UK decide to receive or not the shingles vaccination.","The main objective of this non-interventional case-control study is to explore the determinants of the acceptance of the shingles vaccination in adults who were eligible for National Health Service (NHS) shingles vaccination programme in the United Kingdom, by comparing vaccinated patients with unvaccinated patients. We will leverage Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) general practitioners (GPs) network. This study also aims to describe the patients' population, to identify the sources of information that influenced the patient decision-making process and to assess the physician's opinion concerning the perceived barriers to Zoster vaccination.
Self-administered questionnaires will be distributed to patients aged 80 years and their GPs. 
The study is based on the concept of Health Belief Model (HBM) that explains health seeking-behaviour by assessing how people perceive their susceptibility to a disease, the severity of the disease, as well as benefits or usefulness of taking a new behaviour in preventing the disease, and barriers to follow a preventive action. The underlying concept is that health behaviours are determined by personal beliefs or perceptions about a disease and the strategies available to minimise its occurrence. The model has been used in several studies to understand the differences between vaccinated and non-vaccinated people.
The patient questionnaire will collect socio-demographics, health status, as well as constructs from the health belief model. 
The physician questionnaire will collect demographics, practice location, vaccine recommendations for elderly patients, communication campaign for Zoster vaccination and perceived barriers to Zoster vaccination. The patients' vaccination status, gender, year of birth, GPs' practice size and nation will be obtained from CPRD database.
The patients' and GPs' population will be described.

Results of clinical trials of the 1mg finasteride formulation for alopecia found an increased risk of sexual side effects (1-4), while studies conducted in a clinical setting have suggested that finasteride does not increase the risk of sexual side effects (5-7).  A recent review of sexual adverse events from the few published clinical trials reported that the available data is limited and of poor quality and therefore insufficient for establishing the safety profile of finasteride 1 mg for treatment of alopecia (8). Assessment of unintended effects of finasteride 1mg for alopecia is warranted, especially because these drugs are prescribed to healthy young men. To this end, we propose a drug safety study to examine the association between use of finasteride 1mg in men with alopecia and ED in comparison to men with alopecia who do not receive finasteride 1mg.","We will conduct a cohort study with a nested case-control analysis to examine the association between finasteride 1mg use in men with alopecia and erectile dysfunction (ED).  We will identify a cohort of men with alopecia, aged 18-59, with no history of sexual dysfunction prior to cohort entry. The incidence of ED among men with exposure to finasteride 1mg (the exposure of interest) will be compared to the incidence of ED among men with no such prescriptions. Crude and adjusted incidence rates (IRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) will be calculated for each exposure category (unexposed and finasteride 1mg exposed). IRs will be calculated as the number of incident events divided by exposed person-time.  We will also conduct a nested case-control analysis to control for calendar time, age, and general practice.

Erectile dysfunction (difficulty obtaining and maintaining an erection) is also a common problem, particularly in older men. Men with gout and erectile dysfunction very commonly have other medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart disease and being overweight, and both conditions are more common in people who drink alcohol excessively. It seems likely therefore that gout and erectile dysfunction should commonly occur together. In this study, we will examine whether men who have gout are more likely to develop erectile dysfunction than men who do not have gout.","The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a potentially causal association between the diagnosis of gout and the subsequent development of erectile dysfunction.  The study design is a matched cohort study. Men with a new diagnosis of gout will be matched (1:4) on year of birth and general practice to men without gout up to the date of their matched gout patient's diagnosis. Patients with and without gout will also be free of a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction and not prescribed medication for this condition prior to this date. The outcome of interest will be a diagnosis of incident erectile dysfunction. A feasibility count in CPRD suggests that there are 49,462 men with an incident diagnosis of gout and no pre-existing diagnosis of or treatment for erectile dysfunction from 01/01/1990 to 31/12/2010. Assuming that 8% of men without gout consult for erectile dysfunction over a 10-year period, this sample size provides 98% power detect a hazard ratio of 1.2.

A linked patient-level analysis of the full patient care pathway,"Serious mental illness (SMI) covers a range of conditions including schizophrenia, psychoses and bipolar affective disorder. Patients with these conditions are at higher risk of developing a range of physical conditions and tend to have poorer health outcomes than patients without SMI. Our key research question addresses whether better quality of primary care - as delivered by general practices - reduces the risk of attending accident and emergency (A&E) at hospital, and having poorer outcomes for patients with SMI. 

This research project will enable us to investigate the entire care pathway for SMI patients for the first time in an English study. We will examine the care that patients receive in primary care in addition to their care in hospital and the community. We will also investigate whether the introduction of national guidelines and quality improvement schemes was associated with improved patient outcomes. 

Finally, we will make recommendations to NHS organisations on improvements that can be made within primary care in order to deliver better outcomes for patients with SMI.","In England, general practitioners (GPs) play a central role in the care of most people with serious mental illness (SMI). The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) offers financial rewards to GP practices for good quality care, including payments for treating people with SMI. 

Our key research question is whether better management of SMI in general practice improves health outcomes and health care utilisation for people with SMI. We will measure the quality of care using two methods: 1) indicators from the QOF; and 2) non-QOF quality measures also derived from primary care patient records. Our two outcome measures will include: 1) Number of A&E attendances (found in Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) A&E data), and 2) Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS) scores (found in Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Data Set (MHLDDS) data). We will use quantitative approaches (e.g. regression models, survival analysis, time-to-event analysis) to model the impact of the two types of quality indicators on the two outcome measures, conditional on a number of covariates which may affect A&E attendances and outcome scores.

We already hold a dataset of SMI patients (CPRD data protocol 14_168RMn) and we seek to link this to two non-standard linkages (HES A&E and MHLDDS) to answer the two research questions.","Number of Accident and Emergency attendances

Most commonly, the glands do not produce enough of the stress hormone cortisol, which can cause the body to experience life-threatening shock in response to physical stress. Lack of cortisol also causes over-production of male sex hormones, leading to the development of male characteristics in girls and early puberty in boys and girls. In one form of CAH, the production of another hormone, aldosterone, responsible for maintaining salt levels in the blood, is also decreased. CAH is treated with steroid drugs to replace the cortisol and, where necessary, aldosterone, but there are concerns that these do not successfully mimic the normal daily patterns of cortisol activity in the body.
In this study we wish to use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to identify patients with CAH and describe its effects on patients' health over their lifetimes and at key life stages.

Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) is one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). DFU substantially affects the morbidity, mortality and Quality of Life (QOL) in diabetic patients. Few studies have evaluated the economic consequences of DFU in England with limited level of detail in the correlation to patient characteristics and type of resource consumed.  
Purpose: 
This study aims to describe the clinical and economic burden attributable to DFU in England compared to diabetic with no DFU and to describe differences in clinical & economic burden among DFU population according to patient characteristics as well as healthcare pathways of DFU patients.
Possible results and their significance:
Results from this exploratory research will describe current DFU population, major health outcomes, as well as healthcare resource use and costs in England. Epidemiological investigations may help to document how DFU patients are managed and help decision makers to evaluate the impact of new incoming therapies on healthcare consumption.","Objective:
To describe the population, the complications, the healthcare pathways, the resource uses (RU) and associated costs of DFU patients comparatively to diabetic non DFU patients.
Methodology:
A retrospective longitudinal matched-cohort study using data from the CPRD and linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database will be conducted. Patients with a diagnosis of DFU or DM with no DFU will be included. The DFU population will be matched to the DM with no DFU population to have an accurate evaluation of costs that are attributable to DFU. Subgroups analyses will be performed for several health states and subpopulations e.g. patients with the first ulcer and with a recurrent ulcer.
Data analysis:
Descriptive analyses of patients' characteristics, complications, healthcare pathways will be performed using standard descriptive statistics for continuous variables (N, mean, standard deviation, etc) and for categorical variables (frequency tables). Risk of complications will be studied using adjusted logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier curves will be provided for time to complications. The effect on time to events will also be investigated using Cox regression, to adjust on patient characteristics and clinical history. Costs of DFU will be calculated as the sum of unit costs multiplied by the estimated quantities of resource use.","Healing and complications

Because it contains live substances, the vaccine has to be used before the expiration date printed on the label.
Reports of using vaccine after its expiration date are received in January or February of each year. However, the number of these reports is still very small and it is likely that a large proportion of administrations of expired doses are not spontaneously reported.
The objective of this study is to estimate the risk that children receive expired doses of LAIV in a group that represents the experience for all of the United Kingdom.
Through use of data from CPRD, which is representative of the experience of the United Kingdom population, this study should provide a valid estimate of the risk that children receive expired doses, identify ways to increase awareness and eventually decrease the risk of these errors.","The purpose of this study is to estimate the proportion of LAIV administrations that used expired product among children aged 2-17 years during the two most recent influenza seasons and to identify risk factors. In addition, the study will document the distribution of the number of days between expiration and vaccination date.
Administration of expired LAIV will be identified by comparison of the vaccination date in the CPRD record with the corresponding lot expiration date from records maintained by the vaccine manufacturer. The proportion of individuals receiving expired vaccine and 95% CIs among all LAIV recipients will be calculated according to subject characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities, region, length of registration at the practice), physician practice characteristics (practice size, Health Service Area) and calendar time.

There exist several hypotheses regarding possible reasons for this disease; one idea is that the pressure in the inner ear is too high, and another idea is that the blood flow in the inner ear may not be sufficient. Several drugs can be used to lower blood pressure, and as a consequence they may reduce blood flow. Examples of such drugs are the widely used beta-blockers and the diuretics. We propose to compare use of these drugs between patients with a new diagnosis of MD and patients without MD to explore whether use of beta-blockers or diuretics may alter the risk developing MD. Since beta-blockers and diuretics are widely used, this possible drug effect is of substantial public health interest.","MD is a disease of the inner ear. There is only limited data on the epidemiology of MD and on the underlying pathology which is still poorly understood.
Possible causes of MD may be aberrant fluid homeostasis resulting in a high pressure and endolymphatic hydrops or in reduced perfusion of the inner ear. Beta-blockers and diuretics are both used to reduce blood pressure and therefore may influence blood flow. To our knowledge no previous studies have explored the association between use of beta-blockers or diuretics and the risk of incident MD. 
In this large observational case-control analysis we plan to explore the association between use of beta-blockers and diuretics and the occurrence of MD using conditional logistic regression analyses to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).",Incident diagnosis of MD,"Professor Christoph Meier - Chief Investigator - University of Basel

In recent years, more attention is being focused on medications that play a role in the development of this disease.  A significant proportion of the adult population receives drugs known as statins for ongoing treatment of elevated levels of bad cholesterol. Because statin use is common, it is important to understand serious adverse effects or beneficial effects of statins. The objective of this study is to determine whether statin use lowers the risk of VTE.","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) poses an important disease burden, however a lot remains unknown about risk factors associated with it. Over 25% of Americans >40 years old take statins to treat hypercholesterolemia, particularly patients with other cardiovascular risk factors, and the lipid-lowering effect of statins has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of arterial embolic events12-14. In contrast, randomized and non-randomized studies evaluating the relationship between statin therapy and VTE outcomes have found conflicting results11;15-41. Thus, additional studies are needed to investigate this potential association.
This will be a cohort study among adults during 1995-2017 in the UK-based CPRD. To be included, patients must have; 1)at least one diagnosis of dyslipidaemia, 2)at least one statin or fibrate prescription, 3)at least one year of history in the CPRD before the statin or fibrate prescription, 4)no prior diagnoses of CKD, vasculitis or coagulopathy and 5)no diagnoses of cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer). Exposed patients will be patients with >=3 statin prescriptions and will be matched by propensity scores to patients with only fibrate prescriptions or <3 statin prescriptions in their record. We will follow both cohorts until the development of VTE, death, end of CPRD record, or end of the study period, whichever comes first. Based on the feasibility analyses, we will not be able to compare statin-only to fibrate-only users due to the relatively low number of fibrate-only users when compared to statin-only users.
Using descriptive analyses and Cox proportional hazard models, we will evaluate the relationship between the risk of VTE and statin exposure, in relation to timing, duration of use, number, and dose of statin prescriptions. The proposed study will efficiently evaluate the safety/benefits of statins, which will guide the development of guidelines for its use in the care of patients with hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease risk.","The outcome will be incident idiopathic VTE (DVT and PE. Using Read codes, we will identify the first record of an incident VTE diagnosis in the medical record after study entry (the date of first statin or fibrate prescription). Idiopathic VTE cases will be defined as any VTE case that does not have a code for a proximate cause of VTE (such as surgery, trauma, see below) recorded in the CPRD within 90 days prior to the VTE diagnosis date. We will employ this criterion because, if there is an effect of statin use on VTE, including non-idiopathic VTE cases could dilute the true effect of the statin, (because it is unlikely that there is an effect of the drug in non-idiopathic cases where the VTE is triggered by another cause) and exposure is likely to reflect the exposure in the base population. Proximate causes of VTE include pregnancy, immobility, prolonged hospitalization, fractures, multiple trauma, orthopaedic surgery involving long bones or pelvis and, other major surgery. Any participant with a VTE that occurs after a proximate cause will be retained in the study sample, however they will not be considered a case in this study since they do not meet the case definition of idiopathic VTE. 
To validate the VTE diagnosis we will require that all cases receive a prescription for an anticoagulant (including unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) and fondaparinux) present after the VTE diagnosis. 
VTE codes and anticoagulants are provided in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2, respectively.  We will also consider adding other new anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs.","Professor Susan Jick - Chief Investigator - BCDSP - Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program

It does not usually cause noticeable symptoms until it has spread to other parts of the lungs or around the body. As a result, the chances of surviving lung cancer are low.

Having a way to indicate that a patient may be at a higher risk of lung cancer and thus being able to refer them for more testing would help improve the speed at which is a patient is diagnosed and therefore allow for earlier access to treatment.  

This study will look at the recording of several symptoms/tests prior to a lung cancer diagnosis to asses their potential in indicating the onset of lung cancer. The study will achieve this by comparing two groups of patients up to a 2-year period before a lung cancer diagnosis. The first group of patients will be those who have received a lung cancer diagnosis and the second group will be patients with similar population characteristics but who have not had a lung cancer diagnosis.","Objectives
Compare symptoms and blood test results captured by general practitioners in the two years prior to cancer diagnosis in individuals who developed lung cancer and those that did not.

Methods
This will be a nested case-control study using data collected within the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Cases (lung cancer patients) will be matched to up 4 controls with no record of cancer by sex, age, general practitioner (GP) practice and year of registration. The two-year period prior to cancer diagnosis will be stratified into 2-month time windows, and suspected cancer symptoms as well as blood test (basophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil platelet and C-reactive protein) results will be identified for cases and controls. Proportions of patients reporting symptoms and mean test results for all individuals having a test in the time window will be compared between cases and controls, and multivariable logistic regression will be used to assess the association between blood tests and symptoms and lung cancer diagnosis.

Data analysis 
Appropriate descriptive statistics will be used to summarise relevant clinical characteristics (Section O). These will be categorised to reflect lung cancer status.

Asthma attacks occur frequently and tragically can result in death. One contributing factor of poor asthma control may be the increased use and over reliance on the 'reliever inhaler' (bronchodilator) and underuse of the 'preventer inhaler' (anti-inflammatory).
This study will help us to gain better understanding of patient's views on inhaler usage and why patterns of under use of preventer inhalers and increased use of reliever inhalers have emerged. Furthermore, we will gain better understanding of GP's and Healthcare Professionals' attitudes and approaches to prescribing, how these influence prescribing practices and patient behaviours. 
There has been little research on patients' experiences relating to high reliever inhaler use. In this study, we will investigate attitudes, beliefs, behaviours and experiences of asthma patients towards their inhaler use, using patient surveys, focus groups and in-depth interviews. GP prescribing behaviours will also be measured through questionnaire surveys and focus groups.
These approaches will lead to a better understanding of the reasons and motivations for using the reliever inhaler and how this influences use of the preventer inhaler. This will enable us to develop an approach to influence prescribing practices, leading to better healthcare resource utilization and improved asthma control.","Background: Since 2006, asthma related deaths have declined, however rates in the UK are still higher than Europe, purported to be caused by the under prescribing of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), over reliance and increased use of short-acting beta-agonists (SABA). The high use of SABA and/or ICS underuse is associated with increased healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and exacerbations resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. 
This retrospective, observational and cross-sectional qualitative study, aims to understand the experiences patients diagnosed with asthma have with their disease and their relationship with treatment. Additionally, we will gain a better understanding of GP's and Heath Care Professional's (HCP) prescribing behaviours. 
Methods: CPRD will electronically administer a questionnaire-based survey to 130 research active GP practices who have contributed to CPRD Aurum in the last 6 months. Prior to this a process of critical appraisal will inform development of the GP and patient surveys.
A sub-set of 600 patients, aged 18 and over, with a current validated asthma code and registered with an active GP practice will be selected by CPRD. Both surveys will be electronically administered by CPRD and relayed to patients by the GP practices. The patient survey will be hosted on CPRD's online study platform and will be administered by CPRD. The GP survey will be hosted by [Qualtrics] and distributed to GPs by email from CPRD.
35 patients will be invited to participate in the focus group discussions and a further 4-6 patients will be selected to partake in the qualitative in-depth interviews to obtain further information on their perception, experience of asthma symptoms and relationship with SABA treatment.
Results: Descriptive statistics will characterise the participating population; proportionate responses (cox regression), trends and frequency calculations will quantify the GP and patient survey data; the audio recordings from the focus groups and in-depth interviews will be analysed using a thematic framework approach to identify common themes and patterns relating to SABA, ICS and prescribing behaviours.

After lifestyle changes, patients are prescribed oral antidiabetic treatment to reduce blood glucose level. HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) blood test should be performed regularly to assess the control of diabetes over time. For the majority of patients, the treatment goal is to target an HbA1c <7%. Usually, patients are prescribed with a first drug called metformin as first line treatment. Then, when HbA1c control becomes not sufficient, they are prescribed with an additional antidiabetic drug while continuing metformin (second line treatment). In this study, we aim to evaluate and compare the effect on HbA1c of two antidiabetic drugs often prescribed in the UK as second line treatment: gliclazide modified release (MR) and sitagliptin. Using routinely collected health information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), the main objective is to determine and compare the proportions of patients treated who reach first HbA1c control (HbA1c<7%). The risk of hypoglycaemia reported to the GP after initiating one of the two treatments will be also described. Indeed, in rare cases, an excessive reduction of blood glucose level with these medications can cause hypoglycaemia (very low blood glucose level) which is a safety issue. This research is considered relevant since such evidence does not exist. The findings of this study should help clinicians and ultimately patients considering second-line therapies for the treatment of T2D.","The study design is a matched cohort of new users of gliclazide MR or sitagliptin for T2D in second line treatment after metformin monotherapy. High-dimensional propensity score will be used to match patients (ratio 1:1) between those initiated on gliclazide MR and those initiated on sitagliptin. The analysis will include adult T2D patients using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database.

Initiation of treatment is defined as having at least 2 consecutive prescriptions of gliclazide MR or sitagliptin without a gap >/=90 days, the first prescription defining the cohort entry date. Only patients having received metformin as first-line therapy will be included. Patients with continuous enrolment in the database one year prior to the cohort entry and having an HbA1c lab value >/=7% in the 6 months before cohort entry will be included. Patients will be excluded if they had Type 1 Diabetes, other forms of secondary diabetes or gestational diabetes mellitus. Study period will be until the latest available data capture using GP/ONS/HES linked data. HbA1c assessment window starts at day 60 after cohort entry and ends 30 days after end of durability (defined as index treatment duration until switch/add-on/stop). Outcomes will be defined using UK primary care data (CPRD GOLD and HES). Primary outcome is achieving a target of HbA1C level <7.0%. Proportional hazard models will be used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals of the HbA1c outcome with the use of gliclazide MR versus sitagliptin. Secondary outcomes are as follows: reduction of HbA1c level >/= 1% compared to baseline value, achieving a target of HbA1c level </= 6.5%, incidence rate of hypoglycaemia, durability and persistence of index treatments.",HbA1c; hypoglycaemia; durability; persistence.,"Dr Cortese Viviana - Chief Investigator - IRIS - Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier

These drugs are very commonly prescribed; PPIs in particular are one of the most commonly used medications worldwide. While typically indicated for short-term use, some evidence suggests that they are increasingly being used for longer periods, often times in individuals without underlying disease or for longer durations than necessary. This uptake in use has become increasingly concerning, given that use of PPIs may be associated with some serious complications, including gastric cancer. While several real-world studies have been conducted to address this safety question, the evidence remains limited given the poor quality of previous studies. Thus, we will conduct a large, population-based cohort study to address this safety question in the real-world setting. We will compare new users of PPIs to new users of H2RAs and follow-patients over a 30-year study period to determine whether use of PPIs is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. As patients with gastric conditions are already at an increased risk of gastric cancer, this large study will provide concerned stakeholders with much needed information on the safety profile of these drugs in a timely and cost-effective fashion.","Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are commonly prescribed to manage several gastric conditions. While treatment guidelines suggest short treatment courses for most indications, recent evidence indicates that PPIs are increasingly being used inappropriately, either for longer periods than necessary or by individuals without an indication for use. This overuse is especially concerning in light of recent safety signals associated with the use of PPIs, including a potential association with gastric cancer. As gastric cancer is associated with poor survival, this safety issue is particularly contentious. While several observational studies previously attempted to investigate this safety signal, evidence remains limited by methodological flaws present in early studies, including confounding by indication, immortal time bias and time window bias. Thus, the objective of this large population-based cohort study is to assess whether the use of PPIs, in comparison to the use of H2RAs, is associated with gastric cancer.

To address this, we will assemble a cohort of patients newly treated with PPIs or H2RAs between 1990 (the first full year that both drugs were available) and 2018, with follow-up until 2019. New users of PPIs will be compared to new users of H2RAs, and all exposures will be lagged by one year for cancer latency. To control for confounding, we will reweigh the cohort using high-dimensional propensity scores, which will adjust for more than 200 potential confounders. Patients will be followed from one year after the date of their first prescription until an incident diagnosis of gastric cancer, one year after switch from PPI to H2RA or vice versa, death from any cause, end of coverage, or end of the study period (December 31, 2019), whichever occurs first. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate weighted hazard ratios of incident gastric cancer, comparing PPIs to H2RAs.","The primary outcome is incident gastric cancer, which will be identified using Read codes.

It affects one in three adult women, but, despite the wide-ranging impact, fewer than 20% are actively treated. While lifestyle and drug treatments are offered in primary care, surgical care recommended if symptoms persist. Mesh implants have been used for 20 years to treat urinary incontinence (UI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) (when one or more of the organs in the pelvis (womb/uterus, bladder or top of the vagina) slip down from their normal position and bulge into the vagina).

In response to recent government enquiries, public attention on the complications after mesh procedures, such as infection, pain, depression, anxiety, loss of sex life, and further surgery, has increased. In 2018, the government put an immediate suspension on the use of surgical mesh for UI in England following recommendations by an independent review of the evidence. 

Previous studies have described harms treated in the hospital setting.  Our study will use data from General Practitioners (GP) and hospital records to describe complications in patients with UI and POP, in the primary care setting, where patients are treated and managed by their GP long after surgery.  We will describe complications in those who have and have not had surgical mesh implants. We will also examine whether complications differ in patients of different ages, weights, with different numbers of children or with the surgical speciality. The results will be used to inform future recommendations for patients intervention choices.","Surgical mesh has been used in urogynaecological procedures to treat stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) for the past 20 years. Recent public attention and concerns on complications following mesh in urogynaecological procedures have risen. Such complications may include, pain, infection, depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and further surgery. 

The issues with mesh are complex, recommendations differ between national bodies and there is a lack of evidence to inform long term complications.(1)  Previous research in the UK has used Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data to describe complications (mainly rates of reoperation) related to mesh surgery in the hospital setting. There is a lack of evidence informing comorbidities, workload, prescribing and complications arising in primary care in relation to those who have undergone a procedure.  

Therefore this study will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to HES data to examine the long-term patient outcomes in patients with SUI and/or POP, both with and without surgical mesh implants. Outcomes of interest are grouped into (1) those affecting patient comorbidity and quality of life, such as depression, anxiety and self-harm, and sexual dysfunction, (2) those affecting GP workload, including the number of appointments, referrals, and scans, (3) numbers of prescriptions for antibiotics and for pain relief, and (4) complications. We will describe rates of each outcome stratified by covariates of interest, such as age, body mass index (BMI), parity, those relating to surgery, and other outcomes. We will also fit patient level models (Cox regression for binary variables and, depending on dispersion, Poisson or negative binomial regression for count data) to identify factors that are associated with increased rates of each outcome. Our findings will inform current health policy decisions and shared decision making between patients and clinicians to ensure the safety and management of patients in primary care.","Four classes of outcomes will be examined, focusing on primary care: comorbidities and quality of life, workload, prescriptions, and complications. These are summarised below, and described in detail in section N (exposures, outcomes and covariates).

It represents one of the main risk factors leading to cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or cerebral stroke. In patients diagnosed with hypertension, guidelines recommend lifestyle changes and antihypertensive treatments to prevent these diseases. The objectives of these medications are to reduce blood pressure to recommended targets and to maintain it over time. Hypertension therapy usually begins with one drug, and it is recommended to increase the dose of the initial drug or to add another drug if blood pressure targets are not reached or maintained. Therefore, in clinical practice, blood pressure should be frequently monitored and several drugs can be prescribed over time to lower it. However, despite the availability of a broad range of treatments, a large proportion of adults with hypertension is not at the required level of blood pressure as shown in a study performed in England in 2017 in which 33% of adults aged 45 and over on treatment for hypertension were not at the recommended targets for blood pressure. 
The overall objective of this study is to describe the course and management of blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients in the UK. Particularly for those patients with blood pressure not at the recommended target, the period during which they remain with high/uncontrolled blood pressure and changes in the antihypertensive treatment will be studied.
These findings will provide valuable information for understanding how high blood pressure is managed over time in treated hypertensive patients.","Hypertension is defined by a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mmHg or higher, or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mmHg or higher. It is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and patients diagnosed as hypertensive can be treated with antihypertensive medications to lower their blood pressure and prevent the onset of such diseases. Globally, guidelines for the management of hypertension such as the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidelines of 2011 or the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines of 2013 recommend SBP and DBP targets below 140 mmHg and 90 mmHg in adults, as well as SBP and DBP targets below 150 mmHg and 90 mmHg in the elderly. Despite these recommendations and a large therapeutic armamentarium, 33% of the treated hypertensive population aged 45 and over remained uncontrolled in England in 2017 according to the Health Survey for England. Even though annual prevalence of hypertensive control are available, there is a lack of recent information regarding the management of high blood pressure, or the course of the BP values and treatment changes particularly when not restricted to new hypertensive patients.
The overall objective of this study is to describe the course and management of blood pressure over time in treated hypertensive patients in primary care. Uncontrolled BP in adult patients with a diagnosis of hypertension and at least one prescription of an antihypertensive drug between 2016 and 2017 will be quantified. The description of the management of uncontrolled BP will mainly be based on therapeutic inertia and the time needed to reach blood pressure control. Several subpopulations will be described according to the prior use (or not) of antihypertensive medications and/or their blood pressure control status at index date.",Uncontrolled blood pressure; Time to blood pressure control; Therapeutic inertia; BP values; GP consultations; BP records,"Ms CELINE DARRICARRERE - Chief Investigator - IRIS - Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier

1616634332-2606,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=5,Association of serum bilirubin level with renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and patients with essential hypertension,"Bilirubin is a substance naturally produced by the body when the red blood cells get old and break down. Its level in the body varies to a large degree between people. It has been proposed that the anti-oxidative effect of bilirubin may protect us from kidney diseases.  Majority of published studies are supporting this protective effect of bilirubin while some researches are still sceptical.  We wish to conduct high-quality analyses on high-quality data created from the CPRD GOLD population to provide supporting evidence to this scientific question. We propose to divide patients in the CPRD dataset into those with high and low-level bilirubin and compare how their kidney function changes over time.
     Patients with type 2 diabetes or with high blood pressure are at additional risk of losing kidney function.  When kidney function is lost, the body cannot filter out the waste products in the blood effectively which leads to life threatening adverse events such as a heart attack. If we can show that bilirubin protects kidney function, then we can potentially predict the patients who are at higher risk of kidney disease based on bilirubin level. This will allow doctors to more closely monitor the patients for renal disease and provide better treatment","Recent investigations and meta-analyses indicate a strong association between bilirubin and renal outcomes. We wish to conduct a retrospective study on CPRD GOLD dataset to investigate these associations in a real-world setting. Based on our preliminary feasibility count, we believe the cohorts retrospectively built using CPRD GOLD dataset will be at least one order of magnitude larger than the analyses that are currently available.  Also, we should be able to adjust critical confounders such as haemoglobin level and smoking status that was previously not done or lead to inconclusive results.
     We will retrospectively build two cohorts with known risk factors for CKD: type 2 diabetes or hypertension.  We will follow the patients from the date of diagnosis of either of these morbidities to one of the events indicating the degradation of renal function (eGFR decrease, serum creatinine increase, albuminuria, or proteinuria).  We will fit the Cox proportional hazard models with inverse probability weighting to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio between the patients with elevated bilirubin vs. normal levels.
     We are aware that as this will only be the observational study and we will not be able to conclude the causality of bilirubin levels to CKD progression even if we can show an association.  However, with careful analyses based on richer dataset than what is currently available, this analysis may increase our understanding of the association between bilirubin and CKD outcomes and guide further investigations","1.

An estimated 40 per cent of people with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes will develop CKD (Stages 1 to 5) during their lifetime a condition known as diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Management of diabetes includes many areas that may be influenced by the severity of a patient's kidney dysfunction. Additionally, management of other conditions, such as high blood pressure and conditions associated with CKD, such as anaemia, must also be considered in the care of patients with diabetes and CKD.

It is important to recognize the impact of this combination of diagnoses because the risk of events and death from cardiovascular disease is significantly increased compared to patients without the combination.

This study aims to determine the size of the population group with DKD in England and describe its profile and associated risk factors. Further, we shall determine the health care resource use and costs and clinical outcomes associated with this group of patients.    

This study will be able to provide an in-depth understanding of combination of diagnosis in England considering the increased risk of adverse health outcomes among this group of patients. This will trigger further research and inform health policy, treatment and clinical management options, especially targeting patients with risk factors to enable better outcomes in turn reducing costs and healthcare resource usage associated with DKD.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease frequently coexist, and each disease independently increases the risk of cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease. Diabetes mellitus is currently the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In fact, approximately 40% of patients with diabetes develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD) resulting in albuminuria, reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or both. 

The typical natural history of diabetic nephropathy has been derived mainly from studies in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In these patients, microalbuminuria is the first sign of renal damage and may eventually progress to macroalbuminuria, which predicts subsequent decline of GFR. In contrast, the natural history of CKD in type 2 diabetes mellitus appears to be heterogeneous and a result, there is still limited knowledge on the associated epidemiology, treatments pathway, clinical outcomes, co-morbidities and healthcare resource use and, costs of DKD linked with type 2 diabetes  in England.  

This will be a descriptive study which aims to determine which patients were diagnosed with a combination of Diabetes and subsequent CKD and determining the incidence and prevalence by CKD stage and Albuminuria category, demographic profile, co-morbidities, treatment pathway, clinical outcomes and health care resource use and costs. The study design has been chosen as this is appropriate for data extracted from healthcare datasets that already have data collected retrospectively. CPRD-HES linked dataset has been chosen due to the availability of good quality data for prescriptions, comorbidities, procedures, demographics, costs, complications, and resource use

For these patients, other treatment options include surgery to remove the part of the brain that is causing the seizure, or vagus nerve stimulation in which a small electrical device is fitted that can send impulses to the brain to prevent seizures. In this study we wish to select people with intractable epilepsy and group them according to how they are treated, that is by continuing on drugs alone, by undergoing epilepsy surgery or by having a vagus nerve stimulation implant.

It is estimated that around 14 million people in England alone live with chronic pain. With the number of people experiencing chronic pain increasing with age, it is anticipated that chronic pain will become a greater problem for society in the UK as the population is getting older.
Many forms of therapy exist for the treatment of pain for OA and CLBP patients, including drugs (analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids), surgical/invasive procedures (e.g. total joint replacement, steroidal joint injections) and other interventions (e.g. physiotherapy, pain management programmes). Despite the wide range of approved therapies currently available to patients, therapies that are not recommended for the treatment of pain are being used due to the lack of alternative effective options. Therefore, a need exists for new, more effective treatments.  
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the healthcare services and associated costs to the NHS of treating moderate-to-severe chronic pain due to OA and/or CLBP in England and Scotland using anonymised NHS data. Results from this study may indicate that existing treatment options are not sufficient for managing patients' pain and will help to explore how a new and more effective treatment might be beneficial in the UK.","Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to describe the total healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) and direct healthcare costs associated with moderate-to-severe chronic pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) or chronic lower back pain (CLBP) in England and, where feasible, Scotland.
Methods: This study will be a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study, with comparator group, of OA and/or CLBP patients indexed on a moderate-to-severe chronic pain event between December 2009 and November 2018, inclusive. Moderate-to-severe chronic pain events will include pain-related referrals/visits to secondary care (rheumatology, orthopaedics, pain management or Accident and Emergency [A&E]), prescriptions of pain medications (opioids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and surgical procedures for the treatment of pain in OA and/or CLBP. Each patient within the study cohort (cases) will be matched to at least one general population control with no record of an OA or CLBP diagnosis. For this study, data within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink will be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (specifically, inpatient, outpatient and A&E data) to comprehensively assess HCRU and associated direct healthcare costs, and the Mental Health Data Set to explore aspects of social care utilised within the study cohort. 
Data analysis: This study will be predominantly descriptive in nature, with all outcomes reported using appropriate descriptive statistics, and outcomes compared statistically between cases and controls, where applicable, using standard unpaired statistical tests.

People living with frailty are more vulnerable to illnesses or injury. They may require additional care when suffering a period of ill-health. They may also take longer to recover and may not get back to their previous level of physical ability. Older age is a risk factor for frailty, though younger people can become frail too, especially if they have chronic health conditions such as chronic kidney disease

This study looks at the link between chronic kidney disease (CKD) (where the kidneys stop removing toxins from the blood properly), frailty and mortality (rate of death). Comparing people living with CKD with people living without CKD, we want to see how common frailty is, how quickly frailty develops and whether how frail you are is linked to how long you might live. 

Information collected by GPs on patient's diagnoses and symptoms can be used to create a score called the electronic Frailty Index or eFI. The eFI is a useful way of identifying if a patient is frail and can even give an indication of how frail they are. 

This study will provide important information about if and when we should screen people with kidney disease for frailty. It will also help us to decide when and how we might intervene to prevent frailty, or support those who are living with frailty and kidney disease.","The purpose of this study is to explore associations between reduced renal function (i.e. chronic kidney disease (CKD), frailty and mortality in a UK population. A random selection of patients will be taken who were present in CPRD between January 2006 and December 2015 who had a least two serum creatinine levels recorded and were >/=40 years old. The main objective is to investigate the association between stages of CKD and the development of frailty using the electronic Frailty Index (eFI). Renal status will be modelled as a time varying covariate in a cause specific competing risk survival analysis, using flexible parametric models to estimate time to occurrence of frailty and separately, death. Participants with frailty at baseline will be excluded.  

For our secondary analyses, in people with CKD and non-CKD (stages 3a to 5)  we will also use frailty category as a time varying covariate to investigate all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as time to transplant or dialysis in participants with and without CKD by frailty category

Additionally we will calculate the prevalence of frailty in CKD and non-CKD groups at baseline. We will also identify which of the 35 remaining frailty deficits are most prevalent in frail CKD patients.

For this analysis Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data will be used to provide more complete information on patient ethnicity and CKD related outcomes, and Office of National Statistics (ONS) death registration data will be used to identify the outcomes of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.","- Our main outcome is development of frailty in CKD and non-CKD cohorts, stratified by CKD stage With frailty defined as eFI >/= 0.13 and CKD as eGFR < 60, with no Read/ ICD 10 codes indicating dialysis or kidney transplant.

We will, therefore, study this research question using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Our study population will include all patients with a diagnosis for BPH.  These patients will be classified as those treated with 5Alpha RIs and those treated with Alpha -blockers (an alternative therapy for BPH). We will then compare the number of men with anaemia between each treatment group. We will thus be able to determine if 5Alpha RI use increases the chances of having anaemia compared with the Alpha -blocker use among men with BPH.","5Alpha RIs reduce prostate size among men with BPH by lowering levels of dihydrotestosterone, an androgen that promotes prostate growth. Previous studies have reported that decreased androgen levels are associated with an increased risk of anaemia; however, the anaemia effects of 5Alpha RIs have not been previously assessed in a real-world setting. We will thus conduct a population-based retrospective cohort study using the CPRD to compare the risk of anaemia of 5Alpha RIs versus that of Alpha -blockers. We will identify all patients with incident BPH in the CPRD from April 1998 to March 2019. Using an active comparator, new-user approach, patients will enter the cohort on their first prescription for a 5Alpha RI or an Alpha -blocker.  In our primary analysis, we will use an as-treated exposure definition and will follow patients until the development of anaemia, discontinuation of the study drug, initiation of the other study drug or combination therapy, or administrative censoring. Secondary outcomes will include different World Health Organization (WHO)-defined categories of anaemia severity: mild (129-110g/l), moderate (109-80g/l), and severe (<80g/l) anaemia. We will use Cox proportional hazards models with high-dimensional propensity scores and an inverse probability of treatment weighting to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% CIs for anaemia with 5Alpha RIs versus Alpha -blockers.

Care for patients with diabetes accounts for almost 9% of the NHS budget: £8.8 billion a year. The number of cases of diabetes is rising, due an ageing population. Other risk factors, such as diet and physical activity, also contribute to increased demand for diabetes-related primary and secondary care. 

Annual health checks, and effective treatments, are available to manage diabetes. Nevertheless, diabetes can be difficult to manage in practice. The 2016-17 National Diabetes Audit showed that a large proportion of patients do not achieve the NICE recommended treatment targets. This leaves them at increased risk of preventable diabetic complications. If diabetes is managed poorly, patients often experience worse health outcomes and they might need high-cost care interventions, such as emergency hospital admissions. 

There is little evidence on the variation of health care utilisation by patients with diabetes. It is also unclear what  effect this variation might have on health outcomes. In this study, we aim to describe health care utilisation of diabetes patients. 

Hospital outpatient services are increasingly overstretched. There are plans to transform these services, so we will test strategic approaches that could be used to redesign and improve them.

We will also investigate whether patterns of outpatient care utilisation (e.g. number of visits and follow-up times) affect the risk of experiencing complications. These complications may lead to hospital admissions or death. 

This research will help policymakers and health care leaders target aspects of diabetes care in a way that will improve outcomes for patients. We hope that our results will enable change so that patients will receive better care.","Objectives: The main objective of this research is to increase understanding of health care utilisation patterns by patients with diabetes, and understand the relationship between the frequency of diabetes monitoring in hospital outpatient settings and the risk for diabetes-related complications. We will then develop mathematical models to estimate changes in demand for diabetes outpatient care under different policy scenarios, and estimate the time to impact (i.e. attaining a predefined policy goal) for each scenario. This will allow us to translate our findings on health outcomes into actionable policy recommendations.

Methods and data analysis: A cross-sectional study of CPRD patients registered in 2015-2018 with prevalent diabetes. Data on utilisation (including GP and outpatient care) and health outcomes (all-cause and diabetes-related emergency admissions and mortality) will be derived from CPRD and linked Hospital Episode Statistics and ONS mortality records. Association between outpatient care utilisation and health outcomes will be tested for using use multi-level Cox's proportional hazards model, nesting patients within outpatient care providers. This model will control for patient-based, clinical and disease characteristics and other health care utilisation.

We will then develop an analytical model using Markov Chains, based on outpatient utilisation patterns in the data. This operational research technique that has been used successfully in strategic and capacity planning and to explore the effect of changes to ongoing operations. The model will replicate the flow of individual patients through different ""states"" (where state determined by the frequency of outpatient appointments for that patient). We will use the model to explore the impact of scenarios, such as changing the number of patients entering the outpatient system, or changing discharge rates and/or altering follow up intervals.",#NAME?,"Dr Sarah Deeny - Chief Investigator - The Health Foundation

Researching them is challenging because of:
 - a lack of accurate information on how new cases are recorded, diagnosed and registered across England;
 - incomplete information about the occurrence and natural course of the disease;
 -  poor understanding of the reasons why these diseases occur; and
 - the difficulty in identifying large enough numbers of cases to meaningfully answer research questions.

We intend to use high quality, routinely collected information from the National Health Service (collated by general practitioners, hospitals, and national registrations of rare diseases, cancer and deaths) to find out when, where and in which groups of people histiocytic diseases occur (with specific focus upon Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Malignant Histiocytosis, Erdheim-Chester disease and Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis) have occurred during the last 20 years across the whole of England. We will also investigate what happened to the groups of people with histiocytic diseases. We will be able to detect any inequalities in diagnosis and survival in relation to age, sex, social characteristics and geographical area. Our ultimate aim is to bring greater understanding of these rare diseases, facilitate early diagnosis, improve outcomes and the quality of life of patients.","There are few population-based studies examining the epidemiology of histiocytic diseases, due to the difficulty in identifying large enough numbers of cases.  Routinely collected electronic health data from the UK National Health Service provides a potential opportunity to research these diseases.  The objectives of this study therefore are to assess the occurrence of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), Malignant Histiocytosis (MH), Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) and Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Haemophagocytic syndrome (HLH) as recorded in electronic health records in England between 2000 and 2018, and to measure the incidence, point prevalence and long-term outcomes.  

We will determine LCH, MH, ECD and HLH from CPRD primary care, HES inpatients and Cancer Registry datasets.  We will assess the extent of ascertainment of identified cases between the three datasets. Having assessed our case ascertainment, we will carry out incidence and mortality analyses for LCH, MH, ECD and HLH.  We will analyse and describe trends over time and the known alterations in coding structures and algorithms of the recording of histiocytosis.  We will examine the rates of new diagnoses (incidence) and point prevalence of LCH, MH, ECD and HLH by age, sex, socioeconomic status and region using Poison regression. We will also calculate the 30-day, 1 and 5-year survival. Cox regression will be used to calculate the hazard ratios and a Fine & Gray regression model will be used to estimate cause-specific mortality adjusting for the competing risk of death from other causes.","Incidence, point prevalence, all cause and cause specific mortality","Professor Joe West - Chief Investigator - University of Nottingham

Of particular concern in the context of the proposed study is that asthma is more common in males in the pre-pubertal period, but that this picture reverses in the post-pubertal period.  Sex steroid hormones may largely explain these and other sex related differences in asthma epidemiology and outcomes. We have been progressing research in this area, starting with analysis of serial Scottish Health Surveys in which we found substantial reductions in asthma exacerbations among women using hormonal contraceptives. This was followed by a comprehensive systematic review, funded by the Chief Scientist's Office, which demonstrated that existing studies have major limitations that made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. To overcome these limitations, we were funded by Asthma UK to further investigate this using the Optimum Patient Care Research Database (OPCRD), a UK-wide GP database. Our analysis found that women using hormonal contraceptives were substantially less likely to develop asthma than women who did not use hormonal contraceptives and that longer duration of use was associated with greater benefit (paper submitted). In this follow-on work, we plan to use CPRD to externally validate our findings from OPCRD. Our ultimate goal is to progress these investigations to the point of evaluating whether hormonal contraceptive use is associated with reduced risk of asthma onset in women of reproductive age. This planned external validation is essential to inform plans for progression to future primary prevention trials.","Female sex steroid hormones have been implicated in sex-related differences in the development of asthma. The role of exogenous sex steroids, however, remains unclear. Our recent systematic review highlighted the lack of high-quality population-based studies investigating this subject. We aim to investigate whether the use of hormonal contraception subtypes and route of administration are associated with asthma onset in reproductive age females. Using CPRD, a national primary care database in the UK, we will construct a retrospective open longitudinal cohort of reproductive age (16-45 years) females. We will estimate the risk of new-onset asthma using Cox regression. We will adjust for confounding factors in all analyses. We will evaluate interactions between the use of hormonal contraceptives and body mass index (BMI) and smoking by calculating the relative excess risk due to interaction and the attributable proportion due to interaction.","New-onset asthma is our key outcome of interest. New-onset asthma will be defined as the first General Practitioner (GP)-recorded asthma event (including diagnosis, hospitalisation, medication prescription or any other asthma event) occurring at least 5 years from the start of the follow-up date.

PCOS increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and is associated with a high prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it is unclear whether this leads to an increased risk of angina, heart attack and stroke, or death from CVD. Recent studies have also suggested that children born to mothers with PCOS may also be more at risk of obesity and early puberty. In this study we wish to determine whether women with PCOS have an increased risk of death from CVD and/or an increased risk of angina, heart attack and stroke. We also wish to establish if there is an increased risk of excess weight and obesity amongst their children. To do this we wish to select patients from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with a recorded diagnosis of PCOS and to match them with patients without PCOS by age, body mass index (BMI) and general practice. We will then follow these patients to compare the number who subsequently have recorded diagnoses of each of the conditions and also measure weight gain in their children. In so doing, we hope to establish whether women with PCOS and their children should be screened more intensively for CVD risk.","The aim of the study is to determine if there is an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Both Aurum and GOLD will be used. Aurum will provide sufficient statistical power to ascertain the primary outcome, whilst the smaller population in GOLD will be required to utilise the mother-baby link. The study population will comprise patients with a diagnosis of PCOS from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) based on either a primary care diagnosis using the Read code classification or an ICD-10 coding from secondary care Hospital Episodes Statistics. These patients will then be matched by age, body mass index and primary care practice to control subjects with no history of PCOS. Subjects will be linked to offspring using the CPRD family number. Primary outcomes will be the incidence of large vessel disease (defined by the first record of myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, or revascularisation) identified from either Read code in the CPRD Aurum dataset or ICD-10 code in the HES inpatient dataset. Secondary outcomes will be the incidence of overweight/obesity and premature adrenarche in the children of mothers with PCOS identified from CPRD GOLD. Rates of progression to each primary outcome will be presented and compared using Cox proportional hazard models (CPHM) adjusting for smoking status, Charlson Index, total number of contacts with the general practitioner in the year prior to the index date, and IMD quintile.","Myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, revascularisation in women with PCOS; increased birth weight and obesity in off-spring, premature adrenarche in off-spring.","Aled Rees - Chief Investigator - Cardiff University

1616634263-2577,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=6,Use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2-Is) and risk of lower limb amputation.,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition resulting in increased concentrations of glucose in the blood, which in turn damage many of the body's systems, in particular blood vessels and nerves, which may lead to diabetic foot disease that often leads to ulceration and subsequent limb amputation.  Lower limb amputation is substantially more common among patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) when compared to those without T2DM. Furthermore, T2DM patients who suffer from Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) have a considerable increase in mortality in comparison to T2DM patients without DFU. 

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) are a useful addition to the already existing glucose-lowering drugs since they provide a better control of hyperglycemia and subsequently a reduction of diseases associated with T2DM. However, the results of the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (Canvas) program showed that patients on canagliflozin had a greater risk of amputation especially of the foot. As a result, a safety alert regarding amputations associated with canagliflozin use was issued. In clinical trials with other SGLT-2-Is the increased risk of amputation was not observed. Moreover, observational studies have produced conflicting results.  This may be a result of using different comparison groups and methods. None of these observational studies evaluated the increased risk of amputation and the relevant association of an underlying pharmacological mechanism. In view of this scenario, this study is aimed to investigate the association of SGLT-2Is versus other antidiabetic drugs and the risk of amputation of the lower limb and foot, whilst exploring the potential underlying mechanism.","The objective of this study is to investigate the association between the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2-Is) in comparison to other antidiabetic drugs and the risk of amputation of the lower limb by different sites. A possible mechanism for lower limb amputations is that SGLT-2-I use increases osmotic diuresis together with a reduction in extravascular volume which may lead to reduced tissue perfusion. We aim to investigate hypovolemia as a possible mechanism in this study.

We will first create a base cohort including all patients aged >18 starting with metformin only between 1998 and 2019. From this base cohort we will select all patients with a first ever prescription for a SU, DPP4-I or SGLT-2-I between 1-1-2013 and 30-6-2018. This study period is chosen as SGLT-2-Is have been available from 1-1-2013 in the UK. The date of the first prescription for a SU, SGLT-2-I, or DPP4-I will determine the indexdate. Every patient will be followed from his/her indexdate collection, death, or the outcome of interest, whichever comes first.  The total follow-up will be divided into intervals of 30 days. At the start of each interval we will determine exposure to non-insulin anti-diabetic drugs (NIADs). Based on the time since the most recent prescription an interval will be classified as current (1-90 days) or past (> 90 days) NIAD use. Current use will be further stratified into current use of SUs (reference group), DPP4-Is, SGLT-2Is and other NIADs. 

The primary outcome will be the risk of lower limb amputation. When volume restriction is the mechanism by which SGLT-2-Is increase the risk of amputation, we expect that patients using SGLT-2-Is will also have a higher risk of other foot problems, including an elevated risk of amputations of the lower limb, foot (toes) and a high risk of DFU.","Primary:

Previous research found that women with high blood pressure during pregnancy were more likely to have a future hospital admission for heart attack or stroke compared to women whose blood pressure remained normal during pregnancy. However, some women may present to their GP with persistent high blood pressure or angina and may be diagnosed with heart disease without requiring a hospital admission. Previous research has not looked at when or how women with high blood pressure during pregnancy may subsequently (once pregnancy is complete) present to their GP with early signs or symptoms of heart disease. This is an important gap in our current knowledge because presenting to the GP provides an opportunity for early intervention to prevent serious events such as heart attacks and strokes. 

This study will analyse routinely collected data from general practices in the UK. We will look specifically at women who have had at least one pregnancy and compare the risk and timings of being diagnosed with persistent high blood pressure or heart disease between women who had high blood pressure during pregnancy and those who did not. We are interested in persistent high blood pressure or heart disease that occurs once the pregnancy is complete. We will look at the characteristics of women who develop persistent high blood pressure or heart disease to understand when, how and who to test for these conditions in women who have had at least one pregnancy. This information could help with earlier diagnosis and treatment of heart disease and prevent serious health events or death.","Preeclampsia affects 4 to 8% of pregnancies. It is a multi-system disorder that can affect subsequent (post-pregnancy) cardiovascular health and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. However, the existing evidence base is largely based on hospital admissions data, thus limiting its use for insights into opportunities for early detection and intervention to alter disease progression. Currently, very little is known about the timing of adverse cardiac events in women who have had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, or the effect of lifestyle modification on their development. 

This proposal is a retrospective cohort study that seeks to address these gaps in the evidence by analysing CPRD data to estimate the risk and time to onset of incident cardiovascular disease in women who have hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, to inform subsequent strategies for cardiovascular risk assessment and screening in primary care settings.  Outcomes of interest are indicators of new-onset cardiovascular disease (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease) that occur after a completed pregnancy, in a cohort of women who have no evidence in their GP record to suggest a history of cardiovascular disease prior to pregnancy. We will identify the socio-demographic and clinical variables associated with these disorders and estimate the risk of incident cardiovascular disease in women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy compared to women without, accounting for socio-demographic and clinical risk factors.

The outputs from this project will contribute towards developing a targeted approach using routine data for risk stratification for women who have had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to assess their cardiovascular risk.","Outcomes of interest are indicators of new-onset cardiovascular disease (CVD) that occur after a completed pregnancy in a cohort of women who have no evidence in their GP record to suggest a history of CVD prior to pregnancy.

Its prevalence is documented in the literature and several joint registries highlight it is a common cause of revision surgery to repair an artificial hip joint. Although publications exist examining the costs associated with dislocation, it is an area that is not fully understood and an opportunity exists to gain increased awareness of the healthcare resource utilisation associated with this complication in England. The main focus is on the headline cost of a revision procedure, but the decision to revise will only be made once several attempts at conservative treatment (closed reduction or open reduction) have been undertaken. Each of these treatment cycles carry cost and quality of life consequences. Once successful treatment is completed the patient will require additional rehabilitation and may be at a higher risk of further complications.  
This research therefore aims primarily to quantify the costs associated with hip dislocation over two years following primary surgery; examining conservative and surgical treatment, as well as other associated costs, health care resource utilisation and quality of life.
Additionally, given the close functional connection between the hip and the spine, their simultaneous degenerative pathology is a common problem seen in orthopaedic patients. Reports have shown that patients undergoing spinal surgery and subsequent total hip arthroplasty have higher risks of dislocation. This research aims to also understand if spine surgery prior to or after hip replacement has an impact on post hip replacement dislocation rates in England.","The objective of this retrospective longitudinal cohort study is primarily designed to determine mid-term (two-year) costs, healthcare resource utilization (HRU, including hospital length of stay, length of ICU stay and costs, number of outpatient hospital visits and costs, number of community care resources utilization and costs), dislocation data (including number of dislocation and number of reduction procedures or revision surgeries for dislocation), and quality of life (QoL) among patients with dislocation versus those without following primary total hip arthroplasty. Patients with a primary total hip arthroplasty between 2010 and 2015 will be selected. The main exposure variable will be presence of dislocation within one year following the primary total hip arthroplasty. Patients with dislocation will be matched to patients without dislocation according to their propensity scores. Analyses will be both descriptive and comparative. Multivariable models will be used to adjust for residual confounding and appropriate generalized linear models (GLMs) will be chosen based on the outcome variable of interest for HRU, costs and QoL.

Secondarily as an exploratory analysis, the impact of lumbar spine surgery (12 months before PTHA or 12 months after PTHA) on the incidence of dislocation following PTHA will be evaluated.  First, incidences of dislocation after PTHA will be calculated comparing patients with spinal surgery pre-PTHA to patient without spinal surgery pre-PTHA. Additionally, incidences of dislocation post-PTHA and post spinal surgery will be evaluated for patient with spinal surgery post-PTHA compared to patient without spinal surgery post-PTHA. Patients with spinal surgery will be matched to patients without spinal surgery according to their propensity scores. Analyses will be both descriptive and comparative.

1616634265-2578,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=6,Impact of variability in patient characteristics on effect estimates in observational studies: a retrospective multi-cohort study of rivaroxaban versus warfarin,"When new drugs are approved, often companies are requested to study remaining questions or uncertainties about effects or side-effects of the new drug. One way to study these is through so-called observational studies, in which the investigator observes what naturally occurs in daily care rather than influencing treatment decisions. Since the investigator only observes, he does not influence who is treated and who is not. Therefore characteristics of treated patients often differ from untreated (or other actively treated) patients and these may also change over time. These different patients may in turn also differ in their risk of suffering from a disease or experiencing a side-effect of a drug. 

Other reasons for variation in the type of patients using a drug may be a government decision to allow the drug for treatment of another disease or to reimburse it so patients can actually use it, or a decision by doctors to more often use that drug. All these reasons may change the results of the study. Our study aims to show specific situations under which such changes do or do not occur. 

We will perform this study using an example situation of patients with heart rhythm disorder that are treated with one of the blood thinners called rivaroxaban or warfarin to prevent stroke or clotting of the blood elsewhere in the body to occur. Ultimately, our study may help regulatory authorities to know how and when they should ask for studies, and how long these studies should be continued.","Background
For most medicines, post-approval data generation is important to further characterise or confirm their benefit-risk profile. Observational studies are especially suited to study e.g. effectiveness and safety outcomes but are also prone to various biases that may arise from variability in patient characteristics that may change over time due to deliberate decision-making during the drug life-cycle. Furthermore, increased sample size due to progress of the drug life-cycle will impact power to detect beneficial and adverse effects. 

Objectives
This study aims to quantify the impact of variability in patient characteristics and increasing sample size during a drug life-cycle on relative effectiveness and safety estimates and precision for a case-study of rivaroxaban versus warfarin indicated for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, it aims to quantify the impact of significant regulatory, reimbursement and clinical decision-making on these estimates.

Study design
This is a retrospective study of rivaroxaban versus warfarin, studying multiple cohorts of patients at different points in time during the life-cycle within the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink between 2011 and 2019. Cohorts will vary in sample size and duration of follow-up and may vary in terms of patient characteristics. Patients with an incident diagnosis of non-valvular atrial fibrillation will be followed until the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding or angioedema, or until a censoring event. 

Data analysis 
Propensity scores will be used to identify patient variability between cohorts. To assess relative effectiveness and safety estimates for each cohort, we will model the data using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses and calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, both unadjusted and adjusted for possible confounders. Individual estimates for each cohort and their evolvement over time will be described and visualised. The impact of decision-making will be assessed by adding interaction terms with these time points.","Composite endpoint of stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) and systemic embolism, major bleeding, angioedema","Professor Olaf Klungel - Chief Investigator - Utrecht University

Those from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds are more affected, and more likely to develop multiple conditions at earlier ages. Individuals with multiple conditions tend to have worse health, multiple medications, and often experience discontinuity of care. Multimorbidity is also a problem for health systems, which are focused around the care of single conditions. Although associated with ageing, many people of working age also live with multimorbidity. Current studies have not looked at how multimorbidity in the English adult population has changed in recent years. 
This study will look at the number of patients with multiple long-term conditions between 2004-2018 to see how trends have changed over time, as well as by age, gender, and socioeconomic status. We are particularly interested in multimorbidity with three or more chronic conditions that affect three or more body systems, as this is considered an indicator of poorer health and greater healthcare usage. We will also look for patterns in the age of onset of multimorbidity and the time between developing a first disease and then subsequent conditions. 
Describing these patterns will help us see how multimorbidity accumulates over the life-course and how this has evolved over time, and therefore can help to identify areas for focusing prevention efforts.","Background: Multimorbidity is becoming increasingly prevalent in the UK, with higher burden of disease and earlier onset among the more socioeconomically deprived. Multimorbidity poses unique challenges to the provision of primary care and the structure of healthcare systems currently focused around single conditions. Few studies have looked at multimorbidity incidence, trajectories of accumulation, or equity trends over time in England, and those that have tend to focus on older subsets of the population. Furthermore, the majority of studies have used a definition of coexistence of 2 or more diseases from varying predefined lists of chronic conditions.

Objective: to describe the current patterns of coexistence of multiple conditions treated in primary care over the life-course and over time, and how these patterns vary by socioeconomic status 
Methods: Two measures of multimorbidity will be used throughout: a) basic multimorbidity: two or more chronic conditions; b) complex multimorbidity: at least three chronic conditions affecting at least three body systems. CPRD data will be linked to the English Index of Multiple Deprivation 2010 to allow analyses by socioeconomic status. 
The first stage of this observational descriptive cohort study will calculate the observed incidence and prevalence of multimorbidity by sex, age group, and socioeconomic status over the time period of 2004-2018. We will calculate the median age of onset of initial condition and multimorbidity, along with the median accumulation time from first condition diagnosis to onset of multimorbidity.
In the second stage of the study, we will use survival analysis (parametric or semi-parametric frailty models) to calculate the modelled incidence and prevalence of multimorbidity by sex, age group, and socioeconomic status. Parametric or semi-parametric frailty models will also be used to map trends in age of onset of first incident condition and time of subsequent progression to multimorbidity by sex, socioeconomic status, and initial condition. 

Primary outcomes: incidence and prevalence of multimorbidity. Secondary outcomes will include: a) age of onset of 1st condition, b) age of onset of multimorbidity, c) time between onset of 1st condition and onset of multimorbidity.","Primary outcomes: incidence and prevalence of basic multimorbidity (two or more chronic conditions); incidence and prevalence of complex multimorbidity (three or more chronic conditions in three or more body systems). 
Secondary outcomes include: a) age of onset of 1st condition; b) age of onset of basic multimorbidity; c) age of onset of complex multimorbidity; d) time from onset of 1st disease to onset of basic multimorbidity;  e) time from onset of 1st disease to onset of complex multimorbidity; f) number of chronic conditions
All analyses will be stratified by sex, age group, and quintile of the English Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2010 (as a measure of socioeconomic status).","Dr Kate Fleming - Chief Investigator - University of Liverpool

The background inflammation of the disease, and the drug treatment that patients with RA receive are some factors that contribute to this increased risk of OP fractures in this group of patients.
Glucocorticoids (GC) are probably the most important drugs with a role in osteoporosis that are routinely prescribed in patients with RA. Previous studies showed that taking GC, especially in low-doses, might also benefit these patients respecting bone health, by suppressing the background inflammation of the disease and improving the mobility of patients. Indeed, many studies have shown this positive effect on bone mineral density (BMD). 
But to date, there are few studies who considered the effect of low-dose GC on fracture risk in patients with RA and their results are conflicting, and mostly in contrast to BMD studies mentioned above. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate use of low-dose GC on OP fracture risk among patients with RA in the UK.","Objectives: To investigate the effect of low-dose oral glucocorticoids (GC) on the osteoporotic fracture risk among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 

Design: Retrospective cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD.

Participants: All adults aged 50 years and older diagnosed with RA in CPRD between 1997 and 2017. The ""index date"" will be the RA diagnosis, recorded as the first read code for RA during valid data collection.

Primary exposure: The primary exposures of interest is the use of low-dose oral GC in RA patients, defined as an average daily dose </=7.5mg/d. Exposure to treatment will be assessed in a time-varying way and in 30-day follow-up periods.

Outcome: The outcome in our study is occurrence of the first incident osteoporotic (OP) fracture in RA patients after the index date, which include hip/femur, clinically symptomatic vertebral, humerus, forearm, pelvic, and rib fractures.

Statistical analyses: Cox proportional-hazards models will be used to conduct the statistical analysis. The first and main analysis will compare the OP fracture risk between RA patients who are current users of low-dose GC, and RA patients who stopped taking GC for longer than 1 year (past users). Separate analyses will be conducted for various OP fracture sites. The secondary analysis will focus on a combination of average daily and cumulative dose of current GC use in RA patients and will be compared to past-use. All calculations will be adjusted for the potential confounders.","Occurrence of an osteoporotic fracture, including hip/femur, clinically symptomatic vertebral, humerus, forearm, pelvic, and rib fractures.","Professor Frank de Vries - Chief Investigator - Utrecht University

These drugs lower blood sugar levels and reduce body weight. However, whether these drugs cause life threatening allergies like anaphylactic reactions remains unclear. This is particularly concerning since the risk of allergic reactions is higher among patients with diabetes than in the general population. The current study will use the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink to investigate whether the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, compared with other antidiabetic drugs, increases the risk of anaphylactic reactions. This will provide much needed information regarding this possible association to patients and prescribers.","There is conflicting evidence in the literature regarding the association of GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk of anaphylactic reactions. Indeed,  GLP-1 receptor agonists are potentially immunogenic as they are protein-based molecules. Importantly, two of the approved GLP-1 receptor agonists, exenatide and lixisenatide, are structurally similar to exendin-4, an animal derived protein (hereafter called animal-based GLP-1 receptor agonists), while four other approved drugs of this class, liraglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, and semaglutide, are structurally similar to the human GLP-1 molecule (hereafter called human-based GLP-1 receptor agonists). To date, while several case reports of GLP-1 receptor agonist-associated anaphylactic reactions have been published in the literature, no observational study has been conducted to determine the association between GLP-1 receptor agonist use and anaphylactic reactions. Thus, this study will use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to assemble a cohort of patients, at least 40 years of age, newly-treated with antidiabetic drugs between January 1, 2007 and January 31, 2019. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of anaphylactic reactions associated with animal-based or human-based GLP-1 receptor agonists compared with second- to third-line antidiabetic drugs.

CDIs place a significant burden on healthcare facilities and has been shown to substantially increase hospital costs, hospital length of stay, and can cause death. Although CDI is mostly associated with old age, there is still difficulty in predicting which patients are at a higher risk of acquiring it and in turn should be targeted for intervention.    

This study aims to determine which patient groups are at a higher chance of getting CDI by calculating the number of cases in different age groups, exploring presence of additional diseases and, the likelihood of subsequent hospitalisation and death.  

We shall do this by looking at all patients with a reported CDI diagnosis and classifying them based on whether they developed CDI outside of the hospital (""community acquired"") or in the hospital (""hospital acquired"") and whether it was primary or recurrent (repeat) infection. The general CDI population and each group will be described on their characteristics, health care resource use and selected risk factors. A further step will be a comparison of the patients with CDI with patients without CDI in terms of their chance of dying and developing complications.

We should be able to provide an in-depth look into CDIs in England, which will allow changes in health policy and treatment patterns, especially targeting patients with risk factors and those who consume a lot of resources in the NHS.","There has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of CDI in many countries including the UK in recent years despite guidelines such as restricting the use of certain antibiotics aimed at stemming this increase. With current advancements in vaccine research, there is hope that CDI can be prevented in the most at risk groups which would in turn reduce the morbidity, mortality and health care costs associated with them. However, there is limited understanding of the most at risk groups which would affect the potential of targeted preventive methods such as vaccines if they are to be made available on the NHS. There is also a limited availability of knowledge on the prevalence of CDI based on where it is acquired I.e. in the community or hospital and recurrence. 

This study aims to differentiate between community and hospital acquired infections by calculating prevalence based on point of acquiring the infection. This will be done by creating two cohorts from the general CDI population by defining community and hospital acquired infections using NHS definitions translated into ICD-10 and OPCS-4 codes. 

We shall describe the two cohorts in terms of patient demographic characteristics, prevalence of comorbidities and selected risk factors. Health care resource usage for each cohort will be calculated and reported for inpatient admissions, outpatient, A&E attendances, and primary care appointments. Demographics and health care resource usage for recurrent CDI will be calculated and presented. Outcomes will be described as total, means, medians, percentage or rates as appropriate. 

Adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios along with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for mortality, hospital admission, subsequent CDI morbidity and destination on discharge on comparing each cohort to matched controls. We shall adjust for age, sex and any other risk factors that we may identify as having an effect on the dependent variables.","Prevalence of CDI; Prevalence of recurrence; Prevalence of co-morbidities in the cohort (IBD, CKD, DM, CA); Demographics (Mean and median age on inclusion, age distribution by decade, percent males, deprivation, mean and median follow-up, total and mean admitted time, prevalence of CKD within the cohort, prevalence of Heart Failure within the cohort, prevalence of COPD within the cohort); Healthcare resource outcomes (prescriptions issued in primary care, procedures in secondary care, total appointments and cost in primary care, outpatient appointments, A&E attendances, inpatient admissions, inpatient length of stay, inpatient HRG tariffs, prior hospitalisation); Clinical outcomes(mortality, destination after discharge, severity of the CDI).","Dr Adrian Paul J.

With the known health risks this presents in pregnancy to mother and child, services need interventions to support women planning a pregnancy with weight loss. Current weight loss interventions in pregnancy do not make enough difference and so attention has turned to interventions before the woman becomes pregnant (pre-pregnancy). 

This is not a group that services could specifically identify, with the exception of women using long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) such as the intrauterine device (""coil"") or sub-dermal implants, who need them removed by a GP or Sexual Health Practitioner (clinician) before they can become pregnant.  

The aim of this study is to discover if it is possible to do a research study that asks women who are overweight/obese to delay LARC removal and take part in a pre-pregnancy weight loss intervention. From the CPRD data we want to determine how many women request a LARC removal each year and if it is possible to identify if they are overweight/obese.

The Plan-it study is made of two work-packages (WP); only the first is relevant to this application - WP1 will use routine data to determine the number of LARC removals and outcomes of this potential participant population. This will provide an estimate for a sample size for a future trial in this patient population.
WP2 focuses on finding out the views of women and clinicians about this type of intervention and has separate ethical approval to conduct this research.","Work-package 1 will use routine data from CPRD relating to women attending for LARC removal. 
The tasks are to set up access to anonymised data in order to: 
- understand the pattern of LARC use to identify opportunities to intervene; 
- report the annual number of women in the UK requesting removal of LARC without replacing it with an alternative prescribed contraception; 
- determine the numbers of women requesting LARC removal who subsequently become pregnant who would be eligible to recruit to a weight loss intervention study
- determine the number of events in GP and hospital records to explore time from LARC removal to conception or appointments relating to difficulties conceiving (if possible). 

Inclusion Criteria:
Women of reproductive age (16-48 years old) who have a LARC use/removal Read Code during 01JAN2009-31DEC2018.

Using CPRD data, it will be possible to map the time from LARC removal to conception (the estimated start date of pregnancy, attendance for a pregnancy scan and the first antenatal clinic visit), birth, then further contraception pattern. It will not be possible to definitively know from the routine data if a LARC was removed with the intention to start a family and therefore by following up patients, this will provide more insight with regards to their assumed motivation for LARC removal. We will examine the time between LARC removal and conception to see if a natural cut off exists. Using this cut off and in lieu of any events after LARC removal that would indicate that it was NOT for the purpose of planning a pregnancy (such as starting another form of contraception) it will be assumed that if a participant becomes pregnant in a certain period of follow-up allowed by the datasets, that LARC removal was for the purpose of planning a pregnancy. This will inform the numbers of potential participants available to take part in a future trial.","- Rates of women in the UK who request LARC removal and subsequently have a pregnancy (using routine data).

Over the long term, this can lead to permanent scarring (cirrhosis), which prevents the liver from performing its many important functions, and ultimately liver failure. The serious effects (complications) of cirrhosis include hepatic encephalopathy (HE): damage to the brain caused by the toxins that the liver can no longer remove from the blood.
 
In our study, we plan to examine how patients with liver disease experience healthcare - for example, through GP visits, referral to outpatient specialties, visits to accident & emergency. We will consider these patients in four groups of increasing severity: any liver disease, cirrhosis, HE and predicted HE. For patients in the HE groups, we will also examine how drug treatments affect survival. Patients with HE are commonly treated with rifaximin and lactulose, in combination or alone. We will therefore consider four treatment groups: no treatment recorded, rifaximin, lactulose, and combined rifaximin and lactulose. 
 
To carry out the study, we wish to select adult patients from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with a recorded diagnosis of liver disease, whom we will then categorise into the three severity groups by clinical history and prescription records.","The objective of this study is to better understand the how patients with liver disease experience healthcare by assessing treatment pathways, referral patterns by examining three populations of increasing liver disease severity; liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). We plan to describe the characteristics, and comorbidities of these cohorts overall and split by treatment groups; no treatment recorded, rifaximin, lactulose, and combined rifaximin and lactulose.  We also aim to identify the impact that Rifaximin and lactulose treatments have on the risk of mortality in the HE group. 
Referral patterns will be investigated using the clinical and referral table within Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and the linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data to categorise clinical visits, inpatient admissions, outpatient appointments and emergency admissions to investigate patients disease journey within the UK heath service. 
Mortality risk in patients will be investigated using time dependent cox regression models adjusting for treatment and associated decompensating events. 
Patients within the four severity populations will be identified by: 
Liver disease - identified by the first diagnosis of a liver related code within CPRD & HES identified from Read codes, OPCS and ICD-10 codes in CPRD GOLD and Aurum or prescriptions for Rifaximin 550mg 
Cirrhosis- identified by the earliest diagnosis code for cirrhosis from within the liver disease population cohort identified by Read code, OPCS, ICD-10 codes in CPRD GOLD and Aurum. 
Hepatic encephalopathy - identified from within the liver disease population with a Read code for HE or a Rifaximin 550mg prescription or both a Rifaximin 200mg prescription and a liver disease code.  
Predicted Hepatic encephalopathy - (e.g. identified from Tapper et al.9 risk equation (only if validated in UK data)).

Another alternative class of drugs known as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban are increasingly being used instead of the older alternative, warfarin to thin the blood. Many individuals requiring blood thinning treatment may have several clinical conditions and take many different medications, potentially increasing the risk of interactions between drugs. Some studies suggested how drugs interact with DOACs but the evidence was conflicting. Little is known about the consequences of these interactions. Moreover, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole and pantoprazole, a group of drugs used to treat digestive disorders, have been recently recommended to prevent DOAC-related bleeding in the stomach and intestines. However, whether the treatment effects of DOACs would be compromised by concurrently taking PPIs and DOACs remains largely unknown.

This project will examine the effects of interaction between DOAC and other drugs in the UK. Using anonymised electronic health records, we will find out which medications are being used at the same time as DOACs and warfarin respectively from 2011 to 2019. We will study whether there are interactions between these medications and DOACs, leading to adverse outcomes, for example, bleeding. We will also study how these interactions compare with those seen with warfarin. 

We will also estimate the number of individuals concurrently receiving PPIs and DOACs and study whether PPIs can reduce DOAC-related bleeding in the stomach and intestines, whilst not adversely affecting the benefits of DOACs.","The aim of this study is to explore patterns of polypharmacy and to quantify the health consequences of drug interactions with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). We will focus on drugs which potentially interact with DOACs but currently have conflicting mechanistic and epidemiological evidence including amiodarone, dronedarone, verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin, cyclosporine, simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole. We will also investigate the benefits and risks of using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to prevent DOAC-related gastrointestinal bleeding.

We will identify new DOACs and warfarin users, aged 18 or above during 1/1/2011-31/07/2019 using the data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We will describe the patterns of co-prescribed medications and polypharmacy among oral anticoagulant users. We will then use a cohort study with propensity score and case-crossover study design to investigate if 1)DOACs are associated with interactions with the drugs of interest); 2)whether DOACs have a lower risk of drug interactions compared with warfarin; 3)whether concurrently receiving PPIs and DOACs reduces risk of bleeding without affecting the risk of cardiovascular and mortality outcomes. Outcomes will be cardiovascular events, bleeding and mortality. 

Using cohort study design, we will identify the exposed group (DOAC with the concomitant drug/PPIs) and three comparison groups (DOAC alone; warfarin with the concomitant drug/PPIs; warfarin alone). Propensity score methods will be used to control for confounding. We will compare the hazards of each outcome among the exposed group with each comparison group using Cox proportional-hazard regression. 

Using modified case-crossover study design, we will identify patients with each outcome who were exposed to at least one of the two interacting drugs (oral anticoagulants and the concomitant drug/PPIs). We will compare each patient's exposure in a time period prior to the outcome (hazard window) to that during a control period (referent window) within an individual using conditional logistic regression.","Primary outcomes (cardiovascular effectiveness endpoints): ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular death.

This condition leads to high blood-sugar levels, which can lead to complications such as stroke and heart failure. Due to the many risk factors and health complications that can happen, managing and reducing blood-sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes is highly important. 

There are many medication options available to reduce blood-sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes, with new treatments continuously being developed. Two newly developed treatments for type 2 diabetes include glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is). Research has suggested that, as well as reducing blood sugar levels, both GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is have additional benefits, such as reducing body weight and the risk of heart problems.

Furthermore, patients with type 2 diabetes often require multiple diabetes medications to keep their blood sugar levels down. However, although GLP-1RAs or SGLT-2is are recommended as an optional treatment addition when single drug therapy is not effective, it is currently not known which of these two treatment classes are preferable in the management of type 2 diabetes. Thus, this study aims to compare patients' who are prescribed GLP-1RAs with patients' who are prescribed SGLT-2is for effectiveness and safety outcomes. This study will provide important information to help with clinical decision making in practice.","New drugs for the management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes are continuously being developed. In recent years, advancements have been made in two classes of glucose-lowering drugs: glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is). 

As well as reducing blood sugar levels, evidence shows that these classes of drugs also improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes. However, much of this evidence is based on randomised controlled trials and does not fully represent patients in the real-world clinical setting. Although guidelines suggest when GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is should be administered, current research lacks clear guidance as to which specific drug should be used first. Available systematic reviews and network meta-analysis have compared effectiveness of these drugs within these two classes, however, the benefit-risk profile between the two classes and which drug should be preferred remains unclear.

This study will use routinely collected data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to initially describe demographic and medical profiles of patients taking GLP-1RAs or SGLT-2is. This will be followed by a risk-assessment of heart failure hospitalisation, cardiovascular events and mortality between the two drug classes. Intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes (i.e. glucose lowering, body weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels) and adverse events will also be assessed.","Effectiveness outcomes
Primary (Cardiovascular) outcomes: hospitalisation for heart failure, all-cause mortality, 3-point MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events): stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality.

Secondary (Cardiometabolic) outcomes: change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; %, mmol/mol); body weight (kg); total-cholesterol (mmol/l); HDL-cholesterol (mmol/l); LDL-cholesterol (mmol/l); triglycerides (mmol/l); systolic blood pressure (mm/Hg); diastolic blood pressure (mm/Hg) and heart rate (bpm).

Objectives: The objective of the study is to assess whether there is an increased risk of hepatic or renal events due to methoxyflurane during routine clinical practice pre-hospital and in A&E departments in the UK.

Methods: This study is part of a hybrid study design that combines a primary data collection prospective comparative cohort study with methoxyflurane and a concurrent control group, with a retrospective non-concurrent cohort from routinely collected data. Data on exposure to methoxyflurane in patients aged >18 years and 12-week follow-up have been collected from 12 A&E departments. Data on exposure to other analgesics have been collected in the same way for the concurrent control arm. For the non-concurrent control cohort, patients aged >18 admitted with a fracture to A&E (index date) in the 24-month period from 2 November 2013 to 1 November 2015 (prior to the launch of methoxyflurane) will be obtained from the CPRD Gold-HES A&E linkage dataset. Hepatic and renal outcomes in the 12 weeks following index date will be identified in the CPRD Gold and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) inpatient data. This study will describe each cohort and estimate the incidence rates of hepatic/renal events (cases/patient-month). Comparisons between rates in the prospective-exposure and the historical  cohorts will use Poisson regression. Multivariable logistic regression will study factors associated with hepatic/renal events. Event free survival will use Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Importance: This study will provide information on the safety of the use of methoxyflurane for emergency pain relief in routine clinical care in A&E.",Hepatic and renal events in primary or secondary care.,"Dr Michelle Bradney - Chief Investigator - Medical Developments International

Doctors often perform blood tests during routine health check-ups. To diagnose diabetes, for example, blood glucose (sugar) levels in blood are measured. If they exceed a certain predefined limit, the patient may have diabetes. Standard reference values are the basis for the interpretation of test results. However, lab values are subject to complex control mechanisms within the body and can differ by individual, despite known normal values. Thus, it is not clear whether the ""one size fits all"" approach is always appropriate. Age, sex and underlying diseases, for example, can have an influence on test results. Information on normal ranges or reference values in specific patient subgroups is often not available or is based on studies with small sample sizes. As doctors perform and record many blood tests during routine health check-ups, the CPRD GOLD provides an ideal setting to assess and describe subgroup-specific blood tests and the recorded range of lab values. This will provide an overview of the distribution of lab values in middle-aged persons in a real-world primary care setting.","Most routine lab diagnostics were developed to detect a specific disease, but now are often performed during routine health checks or in patients with ill-defined symptoms. The interpretation of these test results poses a challenge in patient care, as normal values and acceptable deviations from the norm are not well defined or understood. We plan to study all CPRD GOLD patients aged 40-79 years present in the data between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2017 to describe the utilization of major routine blood tests such as lipid and glucose levels, liver or thyroid function tests and blood cell counts. Using descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation, range and percentiles, we will quantify the frequency of testing per year during the study period and describe the distribution of measured lab values for the different lab tests parameters in this middle-aged adult primary care population. We will provide this information for the whole study population, as well as for subgroups stratified by age, sex and prevalent underlying metabolic or cardiovascular diseases.",Frequency of and recorded results per person and per year of the major routinely performed diagnostic blood tests.,"Professor Susan Jick - Chief Investigator - BCDSP - Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program

More than half of all patients with pancreatic cancer die within the first year after diagnosis. It is difficult to diagnose pancreatic cancer at a time, when the disease can still be treated successfully, because pancreatic tumours cause symptoms only when they have spread to other organs. A simple test that detects the disease before patients have symptoms is not available. 
However, it has been observed that blood sugar levels continuously deteriorate in the years before a pancreatic cancer diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes, a disease where there is too much sugar in the blood. Examining all patients with worsening diabetes for pancreatic cancer in clinical practice is not justified, because 4.7 million patients in the United Kingdom have diabetes, but only few of them will have pancreatic cancer. Identification of the characteristics of diabetes deterioration in patients with pancreatic cancer may help selecting subgroups of diabetic patients for further medical examination. 
The aim of our study is to characterize the worsening of diabetes before a pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Specifically, we will explore intensification of diabetes treatment and changes in blood sugar and body weight.","In this descriptive study, we aim to identify characteristics of the deterioration of glycaemic control in the years preceding a pancreatic cancer diagnosis in patients with pre-existing type 2 diabetes. We will select patients aged >50 to 90 years with a first-time Read code for pancreatic cancer between 2004 and 2017 (index date) and a type 2 diabetes diagnosis > 3.5 years before the index date. Patients with type 2 diabetes, but without a pancreatic cancer diagnosis, will be used as comparison group. 
We will assess intensification of antidiabetic treatment, changes in glycated haemoglobin levels, and changes in body weight before the index date in diabetic pancreatic cancer patients compared with diabetic non-cancer patients. 
More specifically, we will evaluate the total number of antidiabetic treatment intensifications (defined as increase in the number of drug classes prescribed or start of insulin treatment) in the time period from 3 years until 6 months before the index date. We will determine time intervals between successive intensifications and types of intensification, and we will assess changes in glycated haemoglobin levels preceding treatment intensification. Other than treatment intensification, we will assess the temporal changes in glycated haemoglobin and body weight in the 3 years before the index date. Baseline will be the last glycated haemoglobin level or body weight recorded > 3 years before the index date but after onset of diabetes. We will stratify our analyses by diabetes duration, as well as by antidiabetic treatment intensification and body mass index, where applicable or appropriate.","We will study type 2 diabetes patients with or without pancreatic cancer. In these patients, we will describe the following key variables before the cancer diagnosis (or the matched date): Number of antidiabetic treatment intensifications (defined as increase in the number of drug classes prescribed or start of insulin treatment); Timing of antidiabetic treatment intensification; Type of antidiabetic treatment intensification; Glycated haemoglobin levels; Changes in glycated haemoglobin levels; Body weight; Changes in body weight.","Professor Susan Jick - Chief Investigator - BCDSP - Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program

It may indicate heart (""coronary"") disease or be caused by a non-coronary problem like a musculoskeletal problem or anxiety. Many patients with chest pain will not be given a specific cause (diagnosis) for their chest pain by their GP and not have any further investigations. However, previous studies including our own have shown that patients with chest pain but not given a diagnosis have a higher risk of future heart disease than those without chest pain, and higher risk of future heart disease than patients diagnosed with non-coronary chest pain. In this study, patients recorded with chest pain but not given a diagnosis will be followed using their medical records for 10 years. We will determine: i) how easy it is to find out, at the time they first see their GP for chest pain, which patients are at most risk of future heart disease or stroke, ii) which patient characteristics predict future heart disease or stroke, and iii) how much targeting important risk factors like obesity, and how much use of early medication to prevent heart disease, may reduce the risk of future heart disease or stroke. Our study will allow GPs to determine more easily those at greatest risk, so they can be given appropriate treatment such as medication to prevent heart problems, and supported to reduce risk factors for heart disease.","Chest pain is a common symptom presented to general practice and may be caused by coronary heart disease or a non-coronary condition such as musculoskeletal disease or anxiety. Our previous study showed that many patients presenting to primary care with new chest pain will not receive a diagnosis and will not be investigated for coronary heart disease. However, studies including our own have also shown that patients with chest pain not attributed to a cause by the GP have an increased risk of future cardiovascular disease compared to those without chest pain and to those diagnosed with non-coronary chest pain. Investigation and instituting preventative measures in all undiagnosed patients with chest pain is not, however, practical. The aim of this study is to assess if it is possible to identify at time of presentation to primary care which patients with undiagnosed chest pain are at greatest risk of cardiovascular disease, and to model the effect of targeting key prognostic factors and preventative medication on incidence of cardiovascular disease in those at greatest risk. Patients presenting to primary care with new onset chest pain unattributed to a cause will be followed using their medical records for up to 10 years for incidence of cardiovascular disease, with a comparator group diagnosed with non-coronary chest pain. We will assess the performance of established cardiovascular risk algorithms in these groups, and use survival analysis to determine baseline factors most associated with onset of cardiovascular disease and to estimate the impact of reduction in levels of modifiable prognostic factors on incidence of cardiovascular disease. Routine assessment of these patients to identify those most at risk in order to offer preventative measures would be implementable in primary care and could contribute greatly to prevention of cardiovascular events.","Primary: Any cardiovascular event;

National treatment guidelines provide a framework for clinicians to prescribe treatments to that are safe, effective and good value for money for both newly diagnosed and long-term patients who may require a change in their anti-diabetic medicines. 

UK treatment guidelines recommend targets for blood sugar control (measured by haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) of between 6.5%-7.5% (48-58 mmol/mol). However, as recommended in recent European treatment guidelines, clinicians must carefully consider treatment options based on the characteristics of the patient and therefore it is likely that the decision of choosing an alternative treatment is not reflected just in terms of a generic blanket use of UK guidelines.  

The aim of this study is to explore relationships between alternative HbA1c targets, individualised patient factors and both short- and long-term health outcomes such as complications which occur due to poor blood sugar control in order to provide evidence to inform an individualised approach to Hba1c target setting. Based on potential alternate target setting proposed as a result of the initial aim, an additional aim to understand the health economic consequences of alternate strategies will be explored.","A retrospective database study of routinely collected UK primary and secondary care data will inform the development of predictive models (risk equations) relating the risk of T2DM-related events to patient profiles. 

Data from the CPRD GOLD dataset in addition to linked hospital episode statistics (HES) admitted patient care (APC) will be extracted for all T2DM patients over the study period 01/01/1998-31/12/2017 based on a 5-year pre-index look back period and a 15-year post-index period.

Patient data will follow all observations up to and including the first occurrence of death, loss to follow up, or the end of the index period (31/12/2017).

Study outcomes include an individual occurrence of: 
a)	microvascular complications;
b)	macrovascular complications;
c)	hypoglycaemia; 
d)	admission to hospital;
e)	death.

Explanatory variables will include factors relating to patients: 

a)	Demographic profile
b)	Socioeconomic profile
c)	Clinical profile

Multivariate regression equations relating outcome risk to patient profiles will be used to generate risk profiles for alternative HbA1c targets. Models will be developed concurrently based both on a single timepoint (i.e. baseline) and across multiple timepoints to consider not only the hazard at a single time-point but also how that hazard changes as a factor of time-varying factors (such as the effect of age, body mass index, etc.) 

Within the model development process, any models developed will be assessed to understand the generalizability related to our dataset and model performance in relation to existing research. Assessments between the two models in relation to predicting complications will be compared utilizing receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine generalizability and applicability.

The health economic consequences associated with an individualized approach to HbA1c target setting will be explored via analyses relating hospitalization and clinical events to HbA1c levels after adjusting for a range of patient characteristics.","Clinical outcomes

The following clinical outcomes will be derived based on the earliest recording of the relevant diagnosis in either CRPD GOLD or HES APC using READ and ICD-10 codes respectively:

- an occurrence of hypoglycaemia, defined as a composite outcome of the first recording of any of:

- an occurrence of microvascular complications, i.e. diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy
- an occurrence of macrovascular complications, i.e. congestive cardiac failure, ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke;

- any admission to hospital;

- death. 

In cases where there are multiple records of an event across the combined data, the earliest record of an event (such as a myocardial infarction (MI)) will represent the index event, with other records defined as representing the same event (MI) if they were dated within 30 days of the index event (MI)).

Health and economic outcomes

The health and economic consequences associated with HbA1c target setting will be based on regression analysis of rates of clinical events and hospitalisations relating these outcomes to patient-level characteristics and HbA1c levels:
 - Event rates: micro- and macrovascular, hypoglycaemia, death;
 - Event costs: event costs in first and subsequent years, based on published sources;
 - Life expectancy: derived from life tables;
 - Quality -adjusted life expectancy: age, gender and event-based disutility profiles will be applied to life expectancy profiles.","Dr Iskandar Idris - Chief Investigator - University of Nottingham

The guidance includes first educating patients on staying active and eating healthy, then escalates to managing the level of sugar in the blood by prescribing medications. Additional considerations include managing the risk of diseases of the heart and blood vessels and other potential complications  through medication. We are interested in determining whether these guidelines are followed in primary care practice in the UK. We will use data collected in hospital and from general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We will examine whether having additional chronic diseases (comorbidities) changes the patient's care pathway, risk of diseases of the heart and blood vessels, prescribed medications, and frequency of doctor's appointments.  Therapeutic inertia is the failure to step-up treatment, despite no improvement in disease management. Therefore, we also want to understand factors that may lead to therapeutic inertia in people with T2DM. Understanding these factors will allow doctors to identify and target patients that are likely to experience therapeutic inertia, putting them at higher risk for complications from T2DM.","In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides guidance for the care and management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in adults (aged 18 and over). The guideline, NG28, focuses on educating patients on physical activity and dietary considerations as a first point of intervention, and then intensifies to managing cardiovascular risk, blood glucose levels, and long-term complications through progressively stronger therapeutic regiments. However, the uptake of these guidelines in the real-world primary care setting is unknown. It is also unknown whether additional comorbidities affect a patient's therapeutic pathway. Therefore, in the first part of this study, we want to determine the prevalence of comorbidities in patients with T2DM and describe how comorbidities affect primary care resource utilisation and costs, outcomes, and glucose lowering treatment pathways. We will use data collected in primary and secondary care for a cohort of patients w ith a first recorded T2DM diagnosis during 01/01/2000-31/12/2018. 

Therapeutic inertia is the failure to establish appropriate targets and escalate treatment to achieve treatment goals. There is a gap in understanding what factors drive therapeutic inertia in patients with T2DM. Therefore, in the second part of this study, we will examine potential points of therapeutic inertia, determine drivers of treatment intensification, as well as identify factors that impact the early lines of glucose lowering therapy for patients with T2DM.

The four main types of eating disorder are: anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED) and atypical or non-specific eating disorder (with the latter satisfying most ED criteria, but not all). 

EDs may co-exist with other health problems but there is scarce literature on related physical health conditions that may develop later in life. An ED can involve excessive eating and/or purging through self-induced vomiting and/or laxative misuse, which may cause severe weight change and chemical imbalances within the body. Other complications may occur including osteoporosis and fracture from reduced bone mineral density; heart problems due to chemical imbalance and reduced muscle strength and reduced fatty deposits; gastrointestinal problems from complication of slowing of the digestive system. Previous studies have reported higher incidence of self-harm and substance misuse and elevated risk of premature death, especially by suicide. 

Using a large electronic primary care patient health record database with linkage to hospital and death records we aim to find out what conditions an individual with an eating disorder is more likely to develop than a person without an eating disorder. We also aim to determine the risk of premature death by natural causes and by external causes. This will be the largest primary care cohort of individuals with an eating disorder to be conducted. One of its aims will be to find out what future physical health outcomes they develop. It will help in closer monitoring and work towards reducing these risks after an eating disorder has been diagnosed.","The aim of the proposed study is to examine whether eating disorders are associated with increased risk of premature death, osteoporosis, fracture and organ failure as well as co-occurring medical conditions and complications such as diabetes, gastro-intestinal problems, substance abuse and psychiatric comorbidities. Using a matched cohort study design, individuals diagnosed with an eating disorder (including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and atypical eating disorder) between 1st January 1998 and 30th November 2018 will be identified using Read, SNOMED and local EMIS codes. Individuals will be eligible for linkage to IMD, HES and ONS mortality records and will have been continuously registered with an up-to-standard general practice for at least one year prior to their diagnosis. Individuals with a diagnosed ED will be extracted and matched on age, gender and practice with up to 20 comparators without a recorded history of eating disorders on the matched individual's diagnosed 'index date'.  

Physical and psychiatric health before and after ED diagnosis will be identified,  including diabetes mellitus (both type 1 and type 2), gastro-intestinal problems, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD),  borderline personality disorder and drug/alcohol misuse. Physical outcomes including osteoporosis and bone fracture, and organ failure, including heart, renal and liver failure will also be identified. All event data will be extracted from contacts through primary and secondary care data sources for individuals with and without an ED. In addition, non-fatal self-harm episodes and alcohol/drug misuse will be identified. Incidence rates will be estimated for all-cause mortality and specific causes of death including natural, unnatural and suicide, non-fatal self-harm and physical health outcomes. Cox regression models, estimating adjusted hazard ratios for each of the fatal and non-fatal adverse outcomes, will indicate whether individuals with ED have elevated morbidity and mortality risk.","We will estimate incidence rates for all-cause mortality, specific causes of death including natural, unnatural and suicide, non-fatal self-harm, osteoporosis,  bone fractures and organ failure (including heart, renal, liver) among patients with and without an eating disorder diagnosis.

The main complaints of patients with COPD are breathlessness and a productive cough, and COPD patients often have periods where their symptoms worsen. The goals of COPD treatment are to reduce symptoms, reduce the periods of worsening of symptoms (called exacerbations), and improve health status and exercise tolerance. Currently, COPD patients are treated with drugs that open airways or reduce inflammation in the lung. For patients with severe disease, a combination of two or three types of drugs is recommended. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of a combination of three different types of drugs called triple therapy. Triple therapy may either consist of a combination of three different drugs in several inhalers (multiple inhaled triple therapy) or in a single inhaler (single inhaled triple therapy). Few studies have reported on the characteristics of patients initiating this newly emerging combination treatment.

Treatments include lifestyle modification (e.g., diet, exercise), use of oral drugs, and then insulin when other treatments fail to control blood sugar levels. However, insulin can cause potential side effects, including severe low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Recently, new insulins that stay in the body for a longer time have entered the market (long-acting insulins).  These insulins are believed to have a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to the older insulin types that stay in the body for a shorter time (intermediate-acting insulins). 

Benefits of long-acting insulins were observed in clinical trials.  However, these trials were conducted in highly-selected patients that are different from those seen in everyday clinical practice. Some studies have examined these new insulins using data from patients in routine clinical practice, but they had important flaws. Higher-quality studies that use clinical data are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of long-acting insulins. To do this, we will use data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).  We will first study treatment patterns of long-acting insulins and intermediate-acting insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Then, we will compare the effectiveness of these insulins at reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dying of heart problems. Finally, we will compare the risk of severe hypoglycemia in patients using these different types of insulin. This study will provide regulatory agencies, clinicians, and patients with important information on the use of these insulins for the management of type 2 diabetes.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by increased levels of blood glucose, which may subsequently lead to macrovascular (myocardial infarction [MI], stroke) and microvascular (neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy) complications. Treatment for type 2 diabetes includes use of antidiabetic drugs and then insulin when other treatments fail to achieve glycemic control. Although effective in lowering glycaemia, insulin is associated with adverse effects in patients with type 2 diabetes, including severe hypoglycemia. Recently, new long-acting insulin analogs (glargine, detemir, degludec) have entered the market; these insulins are believed to have a lower risk of hypoglycemia and provide better weight control in comparison with human intermediate-acting insulin isophane (i.e., neutral protamine Hagedorn or NPH). 

The reported benefits with long-acting insulin analogs were observed in clinical trials, but these were conducted in highly selected patient populations. Recent observational studies have provided conflicting results and many had important methodological flaws that may have introduced bias. Additional methodologically rigorous observational studies with longer follow-up are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of newer insulin analogs compared to human NPH insulin. This study will aim to address the gaps in the knowledge of the utilization, effectiveness, and safety of long-acting insulin analogs vs intermediate-acting insulin. Using CPRD Aurum, Hospital Episode Statistics, and data from the Office for National Statistics, we will include all patients with a first-ever insulin prescription (either long-acting insulins or NPH) from September 1st 2002 to March 31st 2019. We will first describe the utilization of these insulins over time and patient characteristics. We will then investigate their comparative effectiveness at preventing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and hospitalization for heart failure, and their safety with respect to hypoglycaemia.","Our outcomes of interest include major cardiovascular events (MACE; composite endpoint of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death), the individual components of MACE, all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and severe hypoglycaemia.","Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

1616634240-2568,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=7,The association between anticoagulants and cancer incidence among individuals with atrial fibrillation.,"In the United Kingdom, there are approximately 1.3 million individuals diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF). This disease is associated with many serious complications, including heart failure and stroke. To prevent AF-related strokes, individuals with AF are typically prescribed blood thinners, such as warfarin, which have been used for stroke prevention in this population for over 60 years. In addition to stroke prevention, warfarin has been studied as a potential anti-cancer drug, with a recent observational study reporting a 16% decreased risk of cancer among warfarin users compared to non-users. However, not all studies have reported a consistent decreased risk. Over the past few years, the use of warfarin has been gradually replaced by the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which were approved for stroke prevention in individuals with AF in 2011. Unlike warfarin, the use of DOACs does not require constant blood monitoring, though its safety, especially among vulnerable populations, is less established. Indeed, signals from clinical trials support a potential increased risk of certain cancers among DOAC users compared to placebo. While there have been several studies to date assessing the relationship between warfarin use and cancer incidence, no study has included DOAC users. Thus, using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we will investigate this possible link within a large group of patients with AF to address whether warfarin and DOACs are associated with cancer incidence.","Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are two classes of anticoagulants, both used to prevent and treat complications of atrial fibrillation (AF). Both classes of drugs effectively reduce the risk of stroke, though they have different risk-benefit profiles. Indeed, use of VKAs requires careful monitoring through International Normalised Ratio (INR) testing in order to balance the anticoagulation benefits against the potential risk of haemorrhage. However, VKAs have been reported to have anti-cancer properties, with a recent study reporting a 16% decreased risk in incident cancer. On the other hand, use of DOACs does not require INR testing, as it has a more predictable pharmacokinetic profile, though its long-term risks are unknown. Indeed, signals from clinical trials indicate that use of DOACs may be associated with certain cancers. While there have been several studies investigating the association between warfarin and cancer incidence, no study has been conducted to specifically investigate this risk among DOAC users.

Thus, we will assemble a cohort of approximately 55,000 patients newly-diagnosed with AF between August 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017, with follow up until December 31, 2018. The cohort will start in 2011 as this is the year that the first DOAC was approved for stroke prevention in the UK. Use of anticoagulants will be modelled as a time-varying variable, allowing for a 1-year lag period for latency. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of cancer associated with use of VKAs and DOACs, separately, compared with non-use of either study drug. Secondary analyses will assess whether risk varies by duration of use, time since initiation, by cancer subtype, or according to specific VKAs (warfarin, acenocoumarol and phenindione) or DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban).","The primary outcome of interest for this study is an incident diagnosis of any cancer, identified using Read codes. Secondary outcomes, which will be considered hypothesis generating, are the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the UK, including breast, prostate, colorectal and lung, as well as those with numerical imbalances identified in clinical trials, including bladder and pancreatic cancer.","Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

This is one of the commonest cancers, mainly caused by excessive exposure to sunlight. Hydrochlorothiazide is known to make skin more sensitive to sunlight, and this may be how it increases the risk of this type of skin cancer.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are a type of medicine commonly prescribed to treat heart failure, and high blood pressure. Some of these medicines also make the skin more sensitive to sunlight. Some studies have investigated whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors increase the risk of skin cancer among individuals in North American and Scandinavian countries, but the results are conflicting. None of the studies have been conducted in the United Kingdom to date.
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors increase the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer among adults in the UK.","In 2018, the European regulator issued warnings to prescribers that hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a photosensitiser used to treat hypertension and heart failure, may increase the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). An important risk factor for NMSC is ultraviolet light, and although its incidence demonstrates geographic variation, it is particularly common among Caucasians. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are recommended in the UK as first line therapy for hypertension in Caucasian subjects under the age of 55. Photosensitivity is an adverse reaction to ACEi, for example estimated to occur in more than 1 in 1000 but less than 1 in 100 with perindopril. Studies to date on the association between ACEi and NMSC are conflicting, and none have been conducted in the UK. In most, the reference group has been non-exposure, with potential for confounding by indication. Most have not adjusted for use of HCTZ. HCTZ is frequently prescribed with ACEi, but studies to date have not investigated the potential for effect modification by HCTZ. 
We propose a population-based, historical cohort study to determine the risk of NMSC among new users of ACE-I as compared to new users of calcium channel blockers (CCB) for the treatment of hypertension in adults in the UK. Primary objective is to determine whether the risk of first cSCC and of first BCC is greater among adults with hypertension exposed to an ACEi compared to those exposed to a CCB. As secondary objectives, the study will evaluate whether there is effect modification by exposure to HCTZ and by ethnicity. Strength of association will be measured using hazards ratios, after multivariable adjustment with Cox proportional hazards regression.","First diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell cancer (cSCC), first diagnosis of basal cell cancer (BCC)","Dr Laurie Tomlinson - Chief Investigator - London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM )

1616634229-2563,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=7,Which histological subtypes of lung cancer exhibit underlying pre-diagnostic thrombocytosis?,"Cancer is the leading cause of death in the UK, with lung cancer being the most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In the UK, survival is particularly poor for lung cancer compared to other European countries, which is partly due to cancers being diagnosed at later stages. This means that there is a big drive in the UK to diagnose lung cancer earlier, to improve survival.
Recently, we discovered a high platelet count in the blood was a risk marker of undiagnosed lung cancer in a CPRD study, and may be present before more serious symptoms develop. This has great potential to allow earlier diagnosis. There are several subtypes of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, and a smaller miscellaneous group), and it is not currently known whether a raised platelet count is more associated with a particular subtype. Therefore, the primary aim of this project will be to determine the association between raised platelet counts and a future diagnosis (within 12 months) of each particular subtype of lung cancer using statistical tests. This forms the first phase of a two-part study, where the results of phase one will inform and determine phase two. Phase two involves a laboratory investigation exploring the underlying mechanisms behind platelet count and the specific subtype(s) of lung cancer it's associated with, determined by phase one. 
This study will contribute to improving lung cancer diagnosis in a primary care setting and ultimately improve patient survival outcomes.","Thrombocytosis is a newly discovered risk marker of cancer. Our recent CPRD study (winning paper of the year) found that the one-year cancer incidence was 11.6% (95% CI 11.0 - 12.3) in males and 6.2% (95% CI 5.9 - 6.5) in females with thrombocytosis (1); far beyond the 3% risk threshold set by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for urgent investigation for suspected cancer (2). Notably, lung cancer was the most common diagnosis associated with thrombocytosis. In this study, we aim to understand which histological sub-type of lung cancer (i.e. adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer) is more strongly associated with it, which remains currently unknown.
This study forms the basis of this ISAC application, and it will utilise CPRD records linked to National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) data and a matched cohort design (matched for age, gender, and practice) to determine which histological sub-type of lung cancer is most strongly linked to platelet count. This will form the basis for a second study (not to be conducted in the CPRD, but briefly described here) which involves an in vitro investigation of the biochemical nature of the signal released by the lung cancer cell subtype(s) identified in phase one that affect megakaryocyte physiology. We will only perform this phase on the histological subtypes identified in the CPRD study. Cell lines will be tested in vitro for their ability to promote megakaryocyte proliferation, differentiation and platelet formation in a co-culture system, using chromatographic fractionation, proteomics and classical biochemistry techniques to explore the mechanism(s) underlying the cancer-platelet association.
Together, this programme of work will contribute to identifying new ways to achieve earlier lung cancer diagnosis in primary care, and ultimately improve patient survival outcomes. It may also identify novel targets for biomarker development.","The primary outcome is platelet count before cancer diagnosis. Patients with primary lung cancer will be identified from CPRD records using a pre-defined list of medcodes that identify this cancer type. This will be their first cancer of any type; those with subsequent cancers diagnosed will be eligible for inclusion. Linked NCRAS data will be used to sub-categorise patients into four groups, based on the histological sub-type of their cancer: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, small cell cancer.","Dr Sarah Bailey - Chief Investigator - University of Exeter

Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for the vast majority of dementia cases. Currently there is no treatment that stops or slows dementia. Many risk factors and comorbidities are known to be associated with dementia including hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and systemic inflammatory disorders. As treatments for many of these biological mechanisms and conditions already exist, we hypothesise that existing drugs, currently used to treat other conditions, may be also used to treat dementia. This is called drug repurposing. In order to test this, we will use data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and aim to analyse this dataset as close as possible to a clinical trial design with two highly matched groups exposed to the drugs of interest and to a control drug. The list of drugs that will be examined will include drugs chosen on the basis of robust scientific evidence from previous studies, either related to evidence from existing literature on mechanisms of action that are relevant to dementia or their primary indications that are linked to dementia.","This study aims to examine whether already approved drugs for other diseases can be used to lower the risk of dementia and AD and/or slow disease progression. We will conduct a retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis with data on drugs (e.g., metformin) and the diagnosis/progress of dementia. Our outcome of interest will include participants with a diagnosis of dementia or prescriptions to dementia specific medications. We will examine associations between drugs of interest and risk of dementia using several statistical approaches such as Cox regression. For each candidate drug, we will implement a robust synthetic matching with distance measures based on propensity scoring estimated using relevant confounders including: age at initial prescription, gender, deprivation index, smoking status, body mass index, and comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, depression, cancer, COPD, chronic kidney disease). We plan to refine matching by using modern methods of dealing with high-dimensional data such as Lasso and other penalized methods. Our goal is to balance the need to obtain observed treatment and control groups that have similar covariate distributions with the fact that, in some situations, one or both of the observed treatment and control groups may not allow matching using all available covariates. We will investigate the impact of missing values and different approaches to dealing with missing values including imputation methods and deep learning approaches.","The outcome of interest is the incidence and progression of any dementia or dementia attributable to Alzheimer's disease. We will sequentially add definite or probable dementia cases using the list of diagnoses from the CPRD dataset, then complementing it with data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), and potentially using additional algorithm-derived cases. 

For instance, using CPRD data, patients will be considered to have dementia if they had a dementia diagnosis based on Read codes or if they were prescribed with anti-dementia drugs (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, or memantine). Additional information from HES and other linked datasets on mental tests, neuroimaging assessments, and referrals to neurological specialists will also be used to ascertain the suspected cases. 
The event date of dementia onset will be defined as the first-time diagnosis date or the first-time prescription date, whichever came first. The time period of dementia progression will be defined by the time elapsed between the timing of AD onset and the timing of the first prescription in the anti-psychotic class.","Professor Ioanna Tzoulaki - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

It is crucial that we understand how demand for the health system is growing, how the prevalence and incidence of long-term conditions are changing, and how they are likely to change in the future. This will ultimately provide evidence and analysis that will help policymakers and system leaders improve the quality of strategic decisions across the health and social care system.

The focus of this work is on the chronic conditions component of health care demand pressures. The aim of this work is to identify mutually exclusive groups of chronic conditions and comorbidities and to analyse the prevalence and incidence of these over time. This will feed into further work, detailed in a separate protocol, that will look at how the costs and treatments associated with chronic conditions are changing. 

Exploiting CPRD data allows for a more complete picture and detailed understanding of chronic conditions, and their prevalence and incidence over time.","Our aim is to use CPRD to select patients with no, one or multiple chronic conditions as diagnosed in primary care. Once we have selected patients with these conditions, we will analyse trends in their incidence and prevalence over time.

Our research on chronic conditions will consist of two major areas of work:

1.	Categorisation of primary care patients with mutually exclusive chronic conditions and comorbidities. This will draw on existing research that identifies long term conditions using CPRD data 
2.	Time series analysis on trends of incidence and prevalence of those chronic conditions 

Findings from this categorisation and trend analysis will feed into a microsimulation model, or a more standard deterministic projection model, of health care demand and costs which will be outlined in a separate protocol.",Prevalence and incidence of chronic conditions and combinations of chronic conditions over time.

A cohort study using the United Kingdom CPRD,"In the United Kingdom (UK) 13 out of 100 patients suffer from high blood pressure. It is an important risk factor for diseases involving the heart or the blood vessels, for diseases involving the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral blood circulation, and for early death. 

One treatment for high blood pressure is amlodipine 5 mg. Then, if the blood pressure has still not decreased enough under amlodipine 5 mg alone, the general practitioner can increase the dosage up to 10 mg or prescribe a combination of two drugs amlodipine 5 mg and bisoprolol 5 mg. European guidelines on high blood pressure recommend combining drugs rather than increasing the dosage of one. As two different drugs have different mechanism of action, the benefit might be additive, and the adverse effects of the drugs might not be increased. However, this hypothesis has not been confirmed by a study in daily clinical practice.

Hence, the objective of this study is the following: In patients with a high blood pressure under amlodipine 5 mg is the decrease in blood pressure not lower with a combination amlodipine 5 mg and bisoprolol 5 mg, compared to amlodipine 10 mg alone?","Hypertensive patients, switching from a monotherapy amlodipine 5 mg toward a combination amlodipine 5 mg/ bisoprolol 5 mg (first cohort) or switching toward a monotherapy amlodipine 10 mg (second cohort) between January 2000 and June 2018 will be included in this study. One patient from the cohort 1 will be matched up to 5 patients in the cohort 2 via a propensity score. Patients will be followed until: discontinuation or change in the dosage of amlodipine or bisoprolol, addition of another antihypertensive treatment, patient death, transfer out date, end of study period (December 2018).

The primary objective of this study is to investigate in hypertensive patients, if switching from a monotherapy amlodipine 5 mg toward a combination amlodipine 5 mg/ bisoprolol 5 mg is non-inferior to switching toward a monotherapy amlodipine 10 mg in terms of average systolic blood pressure (BP) variation. The non-inferiority margin was defined based on guidelines on the validation of BP monitors indicate that a difference within 5 mmHg is clinically acceptable. Furthermore, inter-individual visit-to-visit variability within 5 mmHg is common in clinical settings. All the BP measurements within the follow-up period will be considered via a linear mixed effects model for longitudinal data.

The secondary objectives are to compare in these two groups, the average diastolic BP, to describe the natural course of BP and to compare the time to controlled BP. The average diastolic BP will also be assessed via a linear mixed effects model for longitudinal data. The natural course of BP and the time to controlled BP via a Markov model.

The exploratory objectives are to compare in these two groups the incidence of the first occurrence of peripheral oedema and bradycardia.

This is important because different types of asthma require different treatment strategies. Some people with asthma have what's known as difficult-to-treat asthma. Their symptoms do not go away, even with high doses of asthma inhaler medicines. They experience several asthma attacks per year, requiring treatment with steroid tablets. Some of these patients, in particular those who have a specific type of inflamed lining of the lung with a particular white cell called an eosinophil may benefit from medicines that specifically target these cells. However, it is unknown how clinicians could best distinguish these patients from patients with other types of inflammation underlying their asthma. 
This study aims to group patients with similar characteristics of asthma together in order to distinguish different types, including the group that may benefit from new medicines, analysing a large anonymous database of patients with asthma that are registered at general practices.","Aim: This study aims to characterise the group of patients with an eosinophilic phenotype of asthma who do not achieve disease control under current guideline-based therapy.

Design: The study will include a broad population of patients, aged >/=13 years, who had active asthma at last data extraction from general practice and >/=1 blood eosinophil count recorded after first asthma diagnosis. 
Active asthma will be defined as >/=1 prescription for a controller or reliever inhaler in the last 12 months.
Patients will be classified into four different grades of likelihood of eosinophilic asthma, based on the highest blood eosinophil count recorded combined with information on clinical features previously reported to be associated with T2-high inflammation, such as age of onset and presence of nasal polyps. 
In addition, unsupervised k-means clustering analyses will be performed to identify groups of patients with a similar asthma phenotype. Agreement between both classification methods will be assessed.
Demographics, diagnosed comorbidities, clinical characteristics, such as asthma severity and control and health care resource utilisation (HCRU) will be described for different phenotypes (both predefined and clusters) and for the total population over the last 12 months. Analyses will be repeated among patients who underwent a recent annual review within the quality and outcomes framework using additional information on asthma symptoms and in the subgroup of these patients with severe asthma.
Among patients who had >/=3 blood eosinophil counts available, characteristics of those with persistently high blood eosinophil counts will be compared with those of patients with intermittently or never high counts using a separate design.

However, guidelines recommend that these drugs should be co-prescribed with caution, and regular monitoring is recommended to reduce the risk of complications such as high levels of potassium in the blood (also known as hyperkalaemia) and kidney dysfunction. 

Hyperkalaemia is associated with an increased chance of being admitted to hospital, spending longer in hospital, and can be fatal in severe cases. In 2016, the Medicines and Healthcare Product Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK drug regulator, published reminders that caution should be used when prescribing these types of medicines together, and also reminded healthcare professionals about regular blood monitoring. More recently, studies in the UK have reported that monitoring of patients receiving these drugs occurs less frequently than guidelines recommend. A rise in the associated number of hyperkalaemia cases has also been reported. 

This study will explore the extent of patients (aged 18 years or over) receiving prescriptions for these two types of medication simultaneously, as well as adherence to treatment monitoring guidelines, between 2014 and 2018. This will provide indirect evidence whether the reminder issued to healthcare professionals in 2016 by the MHRA resulted in safer prescribing behaviour.","While trials have reported on the clinical benefit of co-prescribing aldosterone antagonist and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) drugs in heart failure patients, follow up studies found inappropriate monitoring and higher rates of complications, such as hyperkalaemia, in clinical practice compared to the trials. In 2016, following a coroner's report, the MHRA issued a reminder to healthcare providers in Drug Safety Update (DSU) of the risk of hyperkalaemia and the need for frequent monitoring. The overall aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the regulatory advice communicated by the MHRA on the co-prescription of aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone) and ACEI or ARB drugs. Using CPRD data we will assess the pattern of such co-prescriptions as well as adherence to the recommended blood monitoring over time (2014-2018) in all patients, aged 18 years and over, co-prescribed these drugs, and also specifically patients with heart failure. 

We will conduct the analysis in a phased approach in which firstly we will perform a descriptive analysis to evaluate any patterns of co-prescribing. If the descriptive analysis shows notable differing trends before and after the MHRA reminder, then an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis will be conducted to assess the trend and level change. This will be a quasi-experimental design to examine prescribing trends and also adherence to blood monitoring for patients being co-prescribed aldosterone antagonists and ACEI/ARB before and after the regulatory advice. In addition, CPRD data will be linked to HES, as a sensitivity analysis, to assess whether a more complete ascertainment of patients with heart failure and hyperkalaemia can be ascertained from hospital records.","Primary outcomes:

Research shows that most adult mental illnesses begin in childhood and adolescence. It is important to understand how common mental illnesses are in children and adolescents, and how they themselves may increase the risk for self-harm and other adverse outcomes.
Because published evidence reporting on the number of new cases of mental illnesses that occur yearly is out of date, it is unclear if the number of young people affected by these conditions has increased in recent years. We plan to examine the number of new cases of mental illnesses that have occurred in the past 16 years among children and adolescents in the UK. 
Evidence also shows that individuals who self-harm often develop mental illnesses before they first self-harm. The association between mental illnesses, suicide and self-harm and has not been studied among younger individuals in the UK, nor has it focused on those registered with a general practitioner. For this reason, we will study patterns of general practice consultations, mental illness diagnoses, and prescription of drugs for treating mental illnesses, which occur before individuals harm themselves. In addition, there are no treatment guidelines for anxiety disorder among children and adolescents - one of the most common mental illnesses among young people. We will therefore examine how young persons are treated by their GP after they first receive a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder with the purpose of informing treatment guidelines.","Objectives and Method: 

Study 1: Estimate incidence of common mental illnesses in a cohort of individuals aged 1-19, and examining temporal trends in annual incidence (Cohort study).

Study 2: Individuals aged 10-19 years with an index fatal or non-fatal self-harm episode will be ascertained to build a nested case-control study to estimate relative risk of self-harm and suicide among individuals diagnosed with specific mental illnesses compared to those without, and relative risks in relation to patterns of GP consultation, psychotropic drug prescription, and area-level socioeconomic status. (Nested case-control study)

Study 3: Examine how frequently individuals aged 6-19 years are referred to mental health services, psychotropic medication prescribing patterns, and how often patients consult with their GP 12 months prior to and following an initial diagnosis with an anxiety disorder (Cohort study)

Analysis: 

Study 1: Annual incidence will be estimated from the number of incident cases during each calendar year (2003 to 2018) in relation to the total number of individuals at risk. Rates will be stratified by gender, age and practice-level deprivation (IMD quintiles).

Study 2: Conditional logistic regression models will be used to estimate relative risk for non-fatal and fatal self-harm via calculation of exposure odds ratios.

Study 3: We will report proportions of individuals that are hospitalised, referred to mental health services and prescribed specific types of psychotropic medication, after an initial diagnosis with an anxiety disorder.

Real-world data can offer valuable insight into the safety and effectiveness of new drugs used outside of a well-controlled clinical trial setting.


Patients with Atrial fibrillation (AF) are at increased risk of stroke. Warfarin or NOACs (Novel
Oral Anticoagulants) are prescribed to prevent stroke, and are associated with bleeding
complications. In addition, patients with diabetes are at increased risk for both stroke and
bleeding.

With this study we would like to estimate the risk of major bleeding and stroke in patients with AF and diabetes who are users of NOAC compared to warfarin in a real-world setting, to help establish the effectiveness of existing and future risk minimization measures.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a five-fold risk of stroke. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is one of the most common comorbidities in AF patients, and a well-known risk factor for stroke.

Objective: With this study we aim to compare the risk of stroke and major bleeding associated with NOACs compared to warfarin in patients with NVAF and T2DM in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)

Methods: A retrospective cohort study using the UK CPRD.

One such drug, phenytoin, has been found to reduce metastasis in mice, suggesting that anti-epileptic drugs may have a role in treating cancer. However, in previous research we found that patients taking similar drugs were less likely to survive following a diagnosis of cancer, possibly because they also had epilepsy. We now wish to use a richer dataset to study the relationships between epilepsy, cancer, sodium channel blocking drugs and survival in more detail, including examining specific causes of death. If successful, this would facilitate clinical trials of sodium channel blocking drugs for patients with breast cancer.","Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC)-inhibiting drugs are commonly used to treat epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia. VGSCs are also widely expressed in various cancers, including those of the breast, bowel and prostate. A number of VGSC-inhibiting drugs have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, invasion, tumour growth and metastasis in preclinical models, suggesting that VGSCs may be novel molecular targets for cancer treatment. Surprisingly, we previously found that prior exposure to VGSC-inhibiting drugs may be associated with reduced overall survival in cancer patients, but we were unable to control for cause of death or indication for prescription. The purpose of the present study is to interrogate a different database in order to further investigate the relationship between VGSC-inhibiting drugs and cancer-specific survival. A cohort study using primary care data from the CPRD database will include patients with diagnosis of breast, bowel and prostate cancer. The primary outcome will be cancer-specific survival from date of cancer diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to compare survival of patients taking VGSC-inhibiting drugs (including antiepileptic drugs and Class I antiarrhythmic agents) with cancer patients not taking these drugs, adjusting for cancer type, age and sex. Drug exposure will be treated as a time-varying covariate to account for potential immortal time bias. Various sensitivity and secondary analyses will be performed. The protocol has been peer reviewed and published.","Cancer-specific survival; overall survival, cancer-specific outcome (e.g. hospital admission, treatment).","Dr William Brackenbury - Chief Investigator - University of York

There is not enough good data about how often patients have complications when they are using these modes of treatment delivery.  Also, there may be complications such as infections or skin reactions that are due to the pump system rather than to the medicine that the pump supplies. In this study we will look at how often patients with pump systems have these complications. As diabetes and Parkinson's diseases are very different diseases and their treatments are very different, similarities in the complications between diabetes treatment pumps and Parkinson's treatment pumps may be a result of the pump rather than to the diseases or their medicines. This data will provide an estimate of how common complications are for patients using pump systems. When regulators review data on new drugs that use pump systems, they can use these data as a comparison. If future treatments that use pump systems have more complications than we find in this study, it may be a sign of additional harm from the new treatments.","Insulin pump therapy, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), and apomorphine pump therapy, also known as continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) are used to deliver treatment as a subcutaneous infusion to patients with type 1 diabetes and Parkinson's disease, respectively. The rates of adverse events associated with these pump systems (particularly in real-world settings where user error may be higher than in clinical trials) are not clear. In addition, adverse events associated with these treatments may be caused by the pump system rather than the medication. Using data from CPRD GOLD, we will estimate the incidence rates and cumulative incidence of adverse events among new users of pump systems. Analyses will be stratified by age, sex, BMI, indication for use (diabetes vs. Parkinson's) and comorbidities to identify subgroups that may be at increased risk. These estimates will provide valuable data for patients and clinicians weighing different treatment options as well as for clinicians monitoring the use of these systems in their patients.

In the UK, statins (medicines that lower cholesterol and reduces the risk of heart attacks) are recommended if a patient's 10-year risk of developing CVD is above 10% as estimated with QRISK. Accurate risk prediction for all patients is therefore very important. Previous research in our group has found that risk prediction models such as QRISK do not consistently predict the risk for individual patients but vary widely depending on simple changes to the model. This project will evaluate whether a new class of risk prediction models (called machine learning models) can improve the robustness of risk prediction for individuals or whether they suffer from the same limitations as models such as QRISK. This project aims to evaluate whether a technique called machine learning could improve the accuracy of individual risk prediction. Machine learning is a method in which a computer analyses large amounts of data and then finds patterns in these data. This project will extend a previously approved project that is evaluating the uncertainty of individual risk prediction in models that use routinely collected data.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading reason for death globally, and risk prediction models such as QRISK are being used to predict risk for individual patients. This protocol will use inclusion criteria and outcome definitions similar to the previously approved ISAC agreement (17_125RMn2). The protocol will use machine-learning based methods of model fitting rather than Cox regression as was done in this previous study. The machine-learning based methods considered in this protocol will be based on statistical learning theory rather than artificial intelligence, which have similarities to conventional statistical methods such as Cox proportional hazard model. This study will replicate the modelling process as used in a recent machine-learning paper that used CPRD data and compare machine-learning models' individual risk prediction and conventional model performance to those predicted by QRISK3. The objective of this study will be to determine the level of uncertainty with the prediction of CVD risk for individual patients when using risk scores such as QRISK3. We will evaluate whether statistical learning theory based machine-learning methods could improve the accuracy of risk prediction for individual patients. Statistical learning based machine-learning methods will be used to model patients' data to acquire risk prediction model. These methods will include support vector machine (SVM) and random Forest. We will replicate the process of the recent paper to tune the machine-learning model. Performance metrics (calibration and discrimination) will be compared to QRISK3. To further assess the model's accuracy on individual risk prediction, practice variability will be incorporated into the models by including general practices as random effects. We then compare individual risk prediction from machine-learning models to the random effects models to assess whether it improves accuracy of individual risk prediction in the context of heterogeneity in populations and data completeness between practices.","1.

Currently, real-life data on the patient journey, including clinical outcomes, disease progression, treatment patterns, healthcare resource utilisation and management of CKD patients is limited. DISCOVER CKD is a novel hybrid observational study which aims to create a global population of high-quality CKD patient data. This includes assessment of the patients' historic and future outcomes data that would be captured via mobile and web-based technology, including patient interviews to assess their journey. It will involve patients from the UK, US, China, Japan, Sweden and Italy. Utilising UK clinical practice research database (CPRD) data for the historic  anonymised patients' records will allow us to evaluate and describe: patient characteristics and diseases, treatment patterns, disease progression, clinical outcomes, healthcare resource use, laboratory tests, care pathway and risk factors in patients with CKD across the UK, then where possible, combine aggregated data with data from other countries to assess differences in clinical management of CKD across the countries. DISCOVER CKD will add value to patients by giving them a voice to tell us of their experiences and may impact clinical guidelines, optimizing management of CKD.","CKD constitutes a major cost burden to healthcare systems worldwide, in the UK costing approximately £1.45 billion annually for patients with CKD stages 3 to end stage renal disease (ESRD). The health burden caused by CKD is likely to grow sharply over the next several years due to an increasing elderly population and the escalating prevalence of comorbid conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). The Global Burden of Disease 2015 study estimated that, in 2015, 1.2 million people died from kidney failure, an increase of 32% since 2005(1).  Analysing patient data from several countries (including the UK using the CPRD) will provide regional insights into the real-world patient journey and clinical management of CKD patients. The ambition is that the DISCOVER CKD study will provide the foundation and infrastructure for a large multinational cohort of patients with CKD for pooled or country specific analysis. Additionally, subgroups including but not limited to CKD stage, dialysis status, comorbidity status (e.g. anaemia) and treatment status will be evaluated and described by pooled analysis or country specific analysis.

Methods and analysis plan
All individuals with CKD fulfilling the inclusion criteria and who have at least 1 year of medical history prior to baseline (index) date will be considered. The index date will be either the first documented code of CKD or renal replacement therapy (RRT) on or after 2008 or the 2nd eGFR measure from eligible patients. For analytical purposes, we will include patients in CPRD alone, those also linked to HES data and patients with linkages to other data sources described in section K. CPRD will be combined with retrospective data from other data sources for pooled analysis where time-period coverage and data linkages allow or analysed separately for UK specific analyses and combined with results from other countries.","- Clinical outcomes and hospitalisation (for example: incidence, prevalence, time to event and risk [hazard ratios] of clinical events).
- Death and cause of death (where available).
- Disease progression (for example: eGFR decline, time to ESRD, time to incident anaemia).
- Healthcare resource use and cost (using NHS reference cost tables) (for example describe number of hospital visits).
- Treatment practice, patterns, medications, and medication adherence (for example: number and percentage of patients on CKD related treatments).

In a time of emerging treatment options for type 2 diabetes that may offer benefits to patients with cardiorenal disease, as well as pose risks based on the precise combination of heart and kidney conditions, there is an increasing need to understand the interactions between diabetes complications and the impact on the choice of medications used to treat these combinations of diseases in clinical practice. Work to date include clinical trial studies in patients with type 2 diabetes who already have established heart, kidney and blood vessels problems. The studies show diabetes therapies reduce the progression of diabetes complications. However, as only limited number of people can be enrolled in trial studies due to the rigorous selection criteria, the findings may not be generalised across all populations. The benefit of these therapies on diabetes complications have been demonstrated in real life clinical setting. However, the emerging role of these therapies in the people with type 2 diabetes who have no prior history of cardiorenal diseases is yet to be explored. Therefore, to provide answers to these specific questions, this study will use administrative healthcare records to compare the clinical and cost benefits of two classes of diabetes therapies in reducing the risk of cardiorenal diseases and death in type 2 diabetes patients.","It is increasingly being recognised there are commonalities between cardiovascular, renal and metabolic (CaReMe) diseases with clinical overlap between these diseases and their associated complications. Although these relationships between disorders are increasingly being elucidated there is often under-recognition by health care professionals and patients and this contributes to patients being managed for conditions in isolation. These relationships are increasingly important as therapies develop that could address multiple aspects of disease outcomes and may be used across this spectrum of disorders. Using a cohort of prevalent type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, we will compare the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease outcomes between new users of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and new users of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) in 'cardiorenal disease-free' patients. We compare the patterns of cardiorenal disease manifestation over time, and their subsequent association with adverse clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular (CV) and all-cause mortality where feasible. This study will utilise the CPRD Aurum database and the study period will begin on 1 January 2007 and will end on 30 September 2019. Each of the clinical outcomes of interest will be described separately. Event rates and 95% CIs will be reported as both incidence risks and incidence rates. Survival distributions utilising Kaplan-Meir method will describe time to cardiorenal disease progression, time to CV- and all-cause mortality. Relative risks and risk factors associated with outcomes will be estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. In addition, we aim to further evaluate and compare the healthcare cost benefit of the cardiovascular and renal outcomes between new users of SGLT-2i and new users of DPP-4i. Such evidence will be used to highlight any unmet treatment needs and inform the current literature gap in this area.","The study outcomes are aligned to the core objectives of this study and described below.
Primary objective: Cardiovascular and renal outcomes between new users of SGLT-2i and new users DPP-4i
Primary outcomes include specific hospitalisations for heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, peripheral artery disease (PAD), renal outcomes (including hospitalisation for kidney disease and end-stage renal disease [ESRD]), CV- and all-cause death, and their associated risk factors.
Secondary objective: Health care cost of CV and renal disease after initiation of SGLT-2i and DPP-4i 
Secondary outcomes include monetised costs of health care resource use; resources include disease management services in the clinical guideline, e.g., GP consultations, laboratory tests, medications and hospitalisations.","Dr Jil Billy Mamza - Chief Investigator - Astra Zeneca Ltd - UK Headquarters

This study will examine the influence of the diabetes treatments named  basal insulins Detemir and Glargine on risk of death from diseases of the heart or vascular system ; and on the risk of and death from all causes in patients treated by their general practitioner in United Kingdom (UK). The patients included in the present study have type 2 diabetes, they are 40 years of age or above at time of initiating basal insulin therapy in January 2004- December 2018. These patients will be  assessed through registers (i.e. the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)), with comprehensive data on deaths, deaths from heart and vascular system, and background disease and social-economic variables. The study will provide knowledge of the risk of death in users of the diabetes treatment ""insulin Detemir"", compared to risk of death in users of the diabetes treatment named ""insulin Glargine"".","The impact of different types of basal insulins in patients with type 2 diabetes on risk of death and death from cardiovascular diseases is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to estimate the differences in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates between first time users of basal insulins (Detemir vs Glargine) in a population-based study in UK.

Patients with type 2 diabetes aged >/=40, who initiated basal insulin therapy (Detemir or Glargine) in 2004-2018 will be identified from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), with comprehensive data on mortality, cause of death, and background variables. The estimates will be adjusted for relevant patient characteristics at time of treatment initiation. Follow-up time will be up to 14 years (median 4 years). Exposure variables are defined in two ways:

 - ""ITT (Intention to treat)"" where patients are allocated to the first used basal insulin throughout follow-up.
 - ""On treatment of the first drug used"" where patients are followed while they are on the first used drug and until time of first switch to another treatment, where they are censored. A ""lag time of one year"" for each treatment episode is used.

The fully adjusted Cox's Proportional Hazard (PH) model will include the exposures of interest and adjustment variables such as age, calendar year, sex, diabetes duration, Body Mass Index (BMI), history of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), CVD medication and non-insulin glucose-lowering medications at time of insulin initiation. Time dependent variables are assessed i.e. ""non-insulin glucose-lowering medications,"" ""bolus insulin"" and ""smoking status"".

Accurate information on the impact of hyperkalaemia on patient outcomes and costs can be used to improve the delivery of healthcare services for individuals with the condition.

In this study we will analyse a group of patients with hyperkalaemia and a group of patients without the condition. We will then investigate whether the group of individuals with hyperkalaemia uses the healthcare system more frequently than the group without hyperkalaemia. We will also investigate whether any differences in the frequency of use of the health system lead to differences in the costs of treating the two groups of patients. Finally, we will investigate whether the frequency of significant events, including heart diseases and death, differ between the two groups. Our analysis will attempt to account for reasons other than hyperkalaemia that may lead to differences in outcomes between the two groups such as changes in the dose of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (treatment used for common comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease and heart failure) and the analysis will also explore these research questions within specific groups of patients in whom the results may differ, namely those with long term kidney disease and those with heart failure.","Hyperkalaemia describes abnormally high blood potassium levels above 5.0mmol/L and without appropriate treatment can lead to adverse clinical outcomes and increased utilisation of health resources.

This study will analyse hyperkalaemia and non-hyperkalaemia patients and compare healthcare resource utilisation and costs between the two patient groups. 

Annual utilisation counts (such as GP visits, hospitalisations and outpatient visits) and costs in the year prior to the serum potassium test and in the subsequent 10 years will be captured and compared using generalised linear models and generalised estimating equations.

In 2017, cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounted for more than 160,000 deaths in the UK. Previous research has shown that people have a short-term risk of heart attack and stroke in the days after a serious respiratory infection, such as flu or pneumonia. This risk has mostly been found in older adults and those with pre-existing CVD. 

This study aims to establish whether this risk also occurs in people without pre-existing CVD but who have raised cardiovascular risk, for example high blood pressure, which is suggestive of future CVD. Establishing such risk is important for UK vaccine policy; influenza and pneumococcal vaccination recommendations currently include people aged >/=65 years and those with CVD, but not people aged <65 years with raised cardiovascular risk. 

We will use routinely collected healthcare data in England to compare the occurrence of serious respiratory infections as well as subsequent cardiovascular events, such as heart attack or stroke, in people with a raised cardiovascular risk compared to people without raised risk. 

The results from this study will inform future research to evaluate the impact of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in populations with raised cardiovascular risk.","In the UK there are an estimated 7 million people living with CVD, for which the annual costs are estimated to be £19 billion. As the population ages and multimorbidity prevalence increases, stratified interventions are ever more important. The risk of cardiovascular complications after an acute systemic respiratory infection in people with raised cardiovascular risk but without established CVD is unknown. Quantifying any such increased risk will inform whether these groups should be considered for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination.

Our cohort study will use CPRD data linked to HES and ONS mortality data to increase ascertainment of respiratory and cardiovascular events. We will define cardiovascular risk by hypertension diagnosis and QRISK2 score. QRISK2 is a prediction algorithm for future CVD which utilises a range of risk factors, beyond hypertension, to determine risk. We will first calculate age-specific incidence rates for diagnosis of acute systemic respiratory infections by cardiovascular risk among adults aged 40 to 64 years. We will compare 1) people with hypertension to those without hypertension and 2) people with a QRISK2 score >/=10% in ten years compared to those with a QRISK2 score <10%. We will then use Poisson regression models with Lexis expansion by age group and cardiovascular risk level to estimate incidence rates and rate ratios for 1) acute systemic respiratory infections including influenza-like illness and pneumonia, and 2) major acute cardiovascular events (MACE). Using Cox proportional hazards regression multivariable models, which adjust for potential confounders, we will then estimate the effect of cardiovascular risk on MACE after an acute systemic respiratory infection. In our definition of MACE we will include; myocardial infarction, unstable angina, left ventricular heart failure, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, acute limb ischaemia and cardiovascular death.","Primary
Aim 1 & 2: all-cause acute systemic respiratory tract infections. This includes clinical or confirmed diagnoses such as pneumonia, acute bronchitis, influenza / influenza-like illness (ILI), and other acute infections suggestive of lower respiratory tract improvement.

1616634168-2538,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=8,Hypertension detection and cardiovascular outcomes: a retrospective cohort study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database,"Hypertension is when blood pressure (a measure of the force used to pump blood around the body) is persistently higher than the normal range of values. Individuals with hypertension are at increased risk of dying earlier due to cardiovascular disease (diseases of the heart or blood vessels), especially if not diagnosed, monitored and treated. However, if these patients receive the correct treatment, this risk is reduced. Not all patients who have had a high blood pressure reading have been followed up or diagnosed with hypertension on their medical records.

This study will look at the differences in rates of death and cardiovascular disease in patients who have a diagnosis of hypertension in their medical records and those who do not. To do this we will look at the records of patients who had a blood pressure reading between 1st January 2006 and 31st December 2007, These patients will be divided into four groups based on: (1) whether that blood pressure reading was high or not (2) whether or not a diagnosis of hypertension is in their medical records, and (3) their raised blood pressure has been lowered. We will look at the numbers of patients in each group and differences in their characteristics (e.g. age, ethnicity), and then investigate if there is any difference in the rates of mortality and cardiovascular disease between the 4 groups.

We hope this research will provide information on whether recording a diagnosis of hypertension in medical records leads to better health outcomes for patients.","Hypertension is a common risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. It is the leading risk factor for premature death, stroke and heart disease worldwide (ref WHO 2012). It has been estimated that the global economic burden of increased blood pressure consumes US$370 billion worldwide and 10% of healthcare expenditures (ref Gaziano). Failure to detect hypertension influences mortality rates; higher proportions of the population on general practice hypertension registers are associated with lower premature mortality. However, a comparison of Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) hypertension registers and Health Survey for England (HSE) data indicates that a substantial proportion of patients with hypertension are not documented, and the literature for explaining this is limited.

After adjusting for patient characteristics and other relevant factors, we will undertake Cox survival analysis to compare  outcomes (mortality and incidence of cardiovascular disease ) between 4 cohorts of patients: 
a. Reference group (normal blood pressure and no prior read code for hypertension )
b. Raised blood pressure and no prior read code for hypertension 
c. Raised blood pressure and prior read code for hypertension
d. Normal blood pressure and prior read code for hypertension

By quantifying the current additional risks associated with raised blood pressure, we hope to inform local practices and policy makers in particular about the need to improve hypertension detection and control. In addition, if factors associated with failure to diagnose hypertension are identified (such as demographic characteristics including age, gender, or ethnicity), then, by sharing these findings with services, we anticipate that more patients not identified earlier can be added to hypertension registers and receive appropriate treatment within a 1 to 3-year time frame. In addition, we may identify factors for targeting patients by primary care teams to improve follow up until a diagnosis is made.","The cohort will be divided into the following four groups:

a. Reference group (normal blood pressure and no prior read code for hypertension)

1616634166-2537,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=8,The Use of Anti-Estrogens and the Risk of Parkinson's Disease,"Women with breast cancer are commonly treated with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and tamoxifen which block the action of estrogens in the body. Nevertheless, three recent studies conducted in the real-world setting indicated that long-term treatment with tamoxifen may increase the risk of Parkinson's Disease (PD). These findings are concerning given that women treated with tamoxifen represent older patients who are already at increased risk of PD. However, these studies had several limitations in their design and an inadequate number of patients to confidently assess long-term effect of tamoxifen on PD. Thus, the objective of this study is to address limitations of previous studies and compare the risk of PD associated with use of anti-estrogens (AIs and tamoxifen) in comparison to non-use of these drugs. We will address this question in the general population of post-menopausal women in the CPRD and in post-menopausal women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. We will also independently examine the association between tamoxifen and AIs and the risk of PD and evaluate the long-term effect of these drugs. This study should provide clinicians and patients with strong evidence regarding the risk of PD associated with anti-estrogens in the real-world setting.","Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are widely used for treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer in women. Tamoxifen is a competitive inhibitor of estrogen's action on estrogen-receptors. It has been proposed that tamoxifen thus may counter the neuroprotective action of estrogen. However, findings from observational studies regarding the effect of endogenous and exogenous estrogens on Parkinson's Disease (PD) have been inconsistent. 
Three recent observational studies have reported that long-term use of tamoxifen (more than six years of cumulative use) is associated with an increased risk of PD. These results are of concern given that women treated with tamoxifen represent an older patient population already at increased risk PD. However, these studies should be interpreted with caution as they had methodological limitations and were not powered to assess the impact of long-term use of tamoxifen and thus the increased risk observed after six years of cumulative use of tamoxifen may be due to chance finding. Thus, the objective of this study is to conduct a large-scale observational study with appropriate methodology to assess the risk of PD associated with use of anti-estrogens (AIs and tamoxifen) in comparison to no-use of anti-estrogens. The study will be conducted in a cohort of post-menopausal women in the general population in CPRD and in a cohort of post-menopausal women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. In secondary analyses, the risk of PD associated with tamoxifen and AIs will be assessed independently. We will also examine the effect of cumulative duration of use of these drugs on risk of PD. This study should provide clinicians and patients with strong evidence regarding the risk of PD associated with tamoxifen and AIs in the real-world setting of clinical practice.",We will identify all patients within our cohort with a first-time read code for PD recorded any time after cohort entry.

When people first start using this type of drug, they may (rarely) have a sudden decrease in kidney function. In a previous study, we found that men and women had a different risk of decreased kidney function after starting the drugs. We also saw that a decrease in kidney function after starting renin-angiotensin system blocking drugs was linked to increased risk of long-term poor health outcomes, including severe kidney disease, heart disease and death. However, we do not understand whether and how these long-term poor health consequences are different between men and women. We will use data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to investigate the long-term risk of severe kidney disease, heart disease, and death following a decrease of kidney function after people start on renin-angiotensin system inhibitor treatment and see whether this risk differs between men and women.","We will use a cohort study to investigate if a fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients receiving a new prescription for a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEI], angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB]).

We will identify new users of ACEI/ARB, aged 18 or above between 1/1/1997-31/12/2017. In this cohort of new ACEI/ARB users, in order to identify a reduction in renal function following ACEI/ARB initiation, we will restrict to those with records for both a pre-ACEI/ARB initiation serum creatinine (SCr) (recorded in the 12 months before ACEI/ARB initiation) and a post-ACEI/ARB initiation SCr measurement (recorded in the 2 months after ACEI/ARB initiation). We will use Cox regression to compare the hazards of end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure and all-cause mortality among those with a decrease in eGFR >/=15% to those with a decrease in eGFR <15%.

However, it also found that GPs do not feel engaged in maternity care and that the six-week check is being carried out inconsistently and with the focus mainly on the baby. An expert reference group on postnatal care convened by NHS England has recommended that GPs should provide an assessment for mothers at six-weeks after the birth, and that this should focus on:  mental health and general wellbeing; return to physical health and identification of pelvic health issues; family planning and contraception; and pregnancy-related conditions which may need ongoing management (e.g. if women developed diabetes while pregnant).  

The purpose of this study is to assess the proportion of new mothers in England who received a six-week postpartum check, or appointments related to these specific issues in the first 12 weeks post-partum. We will describe whether access to these checks is affected by where mothers live, their age, ethnicity or other characteristics. We will explore the impact of attending for a six-week check on early detection of key conditions and  the chances that a mother will later need additional care or treatment for key conditions (such as incontinence, depression or anxiety). The findings will be used to inform maternity care policy.","The Better Births report (2016) highlighted the importance of the GP 'six-week postpartum check' in monitoring the health and wellbeing of both mother and baby. However, the maternal checks are being carried out inconsistently. This study aims to:

i) Describe current practice, identifying women who are receiving a six-week postpartum check in England; 
ii) Examine the factors associated with not receiving a maternal six-week postpartum check
iii) Assess the evidence that the six-week postpartum check improves outcomes for new mothers

Data for women who gave birth in England between July 2015 and June 2018 will be drawn from the Pregnancy Register. Where available, a linked baby record will also be used. Descriptive analyses will assess the proportion of women who were offered a check, and how many attended. The patterns of interaction with GP (number, type and timing of consultations) will also be described over the first 12 weeks postpartum. Logistic regression will be used to assess the equity of provision, assessing whether geographic region, maternal age, ethnicity, parity and deprivation are predictors of having a six-week postpartum maternal check, while accounting for similar standards of care within practices. 

A cohort analysis will examine whether a six-week maternal check improves women's outcomes. Outcomes will initially be compared in women who were offered a check and those who were not: including urinary and/or faecal incontinence; perineal pain; depression or anxiety. The prevalence of adverse outcomes will be compared and adjusted Odds Ratios calculated using logistic regression. Cox proportional hazards analysis will be used, to account for differing time to follow-up, examine time to first diagnosis, treatment and/or referral. 

Demographic characteristics, consultations, diagnoses and treatment, including referrals to specialist care, will be informed by Primary Care data.

Symptoms such as delayed speech development, limited interaction with others, avoidance of eye contact and repetitive behaviour movements, are typically identified in childhood. 

There is limited understanding of how the diagnosis rates vary among children of different ages, and if the rates have changed over time, especially with updates in diagnostic criteria for ASD over the last decade. This information would help provide insight for service planning and provisions.

This study aims to describe the proportion of children aged 1 to 18 years that have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We will look back over the last 15 years of patient records and describe the proportion diagnosed each year, to see if this has varied over time. We will also look at the diagnosis rates among age groups in each calendar year.  

There may also be regional variation in diagnosis rates for ASD (for example due to access to services and other factors). We will look at the proportion of children diagnosed with ASD at each GP site, and will describe the variation. We will also report on key factors that may be associated with this, such as ethnicity and deprivation.","There is a paucity of published evidence on the incidence of ASD in children in the UK. Reliable evidence is needed to help provide insight for service planning and provisions.

This study aims to describe the incidence of ASD in children aged 1 to 18 years, and the determinants of variation in diagnosis rates among GP clinics. The study will be an exploratory retrospective cohort study using the most recent 15 years of linked electronic medical records from the UK. 

ASD diagnosis will be identified as any record of autism, Asperger's syndrome or pervasive developmental disorder using an apriori list of Readcodes that have previously been validated and published by Hagberg et al (2017). A patients earliest record of ASD will be their incident diagnosis. 
		
For the primary analysis, annual incidence rates of ASD will be reported to observe if there have been changes in recent years. The incidence at each calendar year will also be stratified by age groups. Incidence rates of ASD by GP site will be analysed to report on variation (after adjusting for patient characteristics). 

Key determinants of variation in rates among GP clinics, such as ethnicity and SES, will also be reported to provide insight on potential equitable or inequitable access to services. 

In a secondary analysis, we will repeat the primary analysis but this time using autism Readcodes only as the outcome (not using Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder).

In sensitivity analyses, we will review patients with discrepant ethnicity data who have initially been classified in one ethnic group, and will move them to their other ethnic group, and repeat the primary analysis. We will also repeat the main analysis (which will use Gold and Aurum combined) but this time analysing Gold and Aurum separately.","The primary outcome is diagnosis of ASD.

Management of cholesterol levels is an important part of preventing such disease and often involves use of cholesterol-lowering drugs.  As statins are in general the most effective available lipid-lowering drugs, and relatively low cost, they are usually recommended as first line treatment.  However, discontinuation of the first trialled statin option is common and often occurs within 1-2 years of starting treatment.  As studies indicate many perceived statin side effects are actually unlikely to be attributable to statins per se, guidelines promote statin re-trial in cases of discontinuation due to potential drug intolerance. Recent studies indicate that re-initiation rates are relatively high.  However, it is not clear how frequently and quickly reinstated/alternative trialled statin therapies are discontinued.  This is important as the impact cholesterol has on blood vessels appears to accumulate across the lifetime, and the extent of treatment benefit is therefore correlated with duration of use.  We therefore aim here to investigate the patterns of statin use post-potential intolerance events in a sample of UK primary care patients.  As it is also unclear whether alternative cholesterol-lowering drugs are trialled where reinitiated/alternative statins are not used in cases of potential intolerance, we also aim to investigate this.","Aim: To investigate the nature and duration of lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) prescribed in response to potential intolerance to first statin

Beyond these direct symptoms, the condition is also associated with a number of other conditions, such as heart disease and depression. A less well understood association is that between psoriasis and cancer. 
In examining a possible link between psoriasis and risk of cancer, it is important to consider the presence of additional risk factors. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these factors is the role of psoriasis severity, with some earlier studies suggesting that risk of experiencing some cancers may differ according to severity of psoriasis. Furthermore, it is also possible that other cancer risk factors such as smoking, higher levels of alcohol consumption, obesity and certain treatments are also involved in any increased risk.
The aim of this study is therefore to explore the association between psoriasis and cancer, with a particular consideration for psoriasis severity and the influence of potential cancer risk factors.","The association between psoriasis and cancer remains unclear, with regards to both overall cancer and specific cancers. The aim of this study is therefore to explore whether individuals with psoriasis are at an increased risk of developing cancer, and dying due to cancer, compared to the general population.

A cohort study in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)","In the United Kingdom 13 out of 100 patients suffer from high blood pressure. High blood pressure can be treated with different drug classes. Each of these classes presents different benefits in terms of blood pressure reduction, and as well different profiles in terms of adverse effects. 

In one study already approved by ISAC (18_106), the difference in terms of benefits between the drug classes was studied. However, among one of these classes (beta-blockers), these benefits might vary between the specific drugs of the class (bisoprolol or else). Hence, in this study, we will compare bisoprolol, against the other classes used to treat high blood pressure. Specifically, the potential benefit in blood pressure decrease of bisoprolol will be compared to each of the following groups: against other Beta -blockers, against angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, against calcium channel blockers, and against diuretics. 

In addition, we will compare the adverse effect profile of bisoprolol against the other classes used to treat high blood pressure. Specifically, we will compare the occurrence of: type 2 diabetes mellitus (chronic high blood glucose), high blood triglyceride or cholesterol, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, high blood glucose.

Using data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) will allows to answer these questions in the real-world clinical practice.","This study will focus on newly hypertensive patients. And among them, on patients newly treated with an antihypertensive treatment in monotherapy. 

Five exclusive cohorts will be defined among patients treated with bisoprolol, another Beta -blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I)/angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCB), or diuretics. Patients will be followed from the start of the prescription to discontinuation, addition of another antihypertensive treatment, patient death, transfer out date, December 2018.

The blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients initiating a treatment with bisoprolol between 2000 and 2017 will be compared to the blood pressure reduction in patients initiating an antihypertensive treatment in the other cohorts. Indeed, the primary objective will be to investigate distinctly the average variation of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP). All the BP measurements within the follow-up period will be considered via joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event (death) data. 

The secondary objectives will be to investigate the time to controlled BP, and the natural course of BP via a multistate Markov model. It will describe the course of hypertension within different states: controlled BP, and uncontrolled BP. In addition, the secondary objectives will be to investigate the first occurrence of adverse events (type 2 diabetes mellitus dyslipidaemia, erectile dysfunction, obesity, and hyperglycaemic events) via Cox proportional hazard models and Fine and Gray proportional subdistribution hazards models. Finally, the variation of body mass index between the drug initiation and one year after will be investigated via a linear regression.

To account for difference in baseline characteristics between group, 1 patient from the bisoprolol cohort will be matched on a propensity score to 4 patients in the compared cohorts. The propensity score will be built using boosted regression trees, with known risk factors for the outcomes.","Primary outcomes: Average systolic blood pressure (BP) variation; Average diastolic BP variation.

1616634187-2546,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=8,Using routinely collected healthcare data to predict onset of AF and determine subsequent disease trajectories,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heartbeat. It is common and can cause problems such as stroke, dementia and heart failure. 

Whilst AF is common, it is often diagnosed too late - only after complications such as stroke have occurred. There are still uncertainties about who gets AF and why, and which health conditions people with AF are likely to develop later in life. 

In this research we will use hospital and primary care medical records to see if we are able to predict who is likely to get AF, and to look at what happens to patients diagnosed with AF in the long term. We will study patient's information such as age and gender, as well as their medical history to determine how these may be associated with developing AF. We will also study the medications used to treat AF and to reduce the risk of stroke.

The research will use traditional statistical methods as well as artificial intelligence to try and answer these questions.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cardiovascular health problem: it is common, chronic and incurs substantial health-care expenditure as a result of stroke, sudden death, heart failure and unplanned hospitalisation.

Yet, many patients with AF are diagnosed too late - for example, when stroke has occurred. Moreover, there is very little information about the prediction of for whom and when new onset AF will occur - a fundamental knowledge gap which if filled could transform the outcomes of patients with AF. Equally, little is known about the full extent of the health burden of AF - beyond that of hypothesis-driven clinical outcomes, such as stroke, myocardial infarction and health failure. In addition, oral anticoagulation is often prescribed to patients with AF to reduce the risk of stroke prevention; however, their uptake is limited. 

In essence, there are no largescale population-based studies which provide high-resolution insights into the healthcare burden, treatment and disease trajectories of patients with AF.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the healthcare burden and clinical pathways of patients with AF using national hospital linked electronic primary healthcare databases.
Specifically, the study will:
1.	Quantify the incidence of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, and project the disease pathways amongst AF patients compared with the general population.
2.	Investigate the use of oral anticoagulants among patients with AF and quantify their association with major cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes.
3.	Determine predictors of new onset of AF.

Quantifying the population trends and clinical pathways of AF patients, its management with the uptake of oral anticoagulants and subsequent healthcare burden will help target therapeutic strategies to specific groups of patients to further reduce the incidence of stroke and premature mortality. In addition, determining the predictive factors for new onset AF also help targeting the high-risk individuals for preventive measures.","Cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular related hospital admission, atrial fibrillation, mortality","Dr Jianhua Wu - Chief Investigator - University of Leeds

Therefore, individuals with atrial fibrillation are often recommended to take blood-thinning drugs (anticoagulants) to prevent stroke. Recent evidence has shown that having atrial fibrillation is also linked to dementia and other problems with memory such as mild cognitive impairment. However, while taking anticoagulant drugs may help to delay the onset of dementia among individuals with atrial fibrillation, we do not know which types of anticoagulants drugs are most beneficial and for which groups of patients. This study will follow older individuals with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation identified in UK healthcare data to investigate the effect of different anticoagulant drug prescriptions on rates of dementia and mild cognitive impairment. This will help clinicians to make informed choices about prescribing anticoagulants for older individuals with new atrial fibrillation.","Atrial fibrillation is common: the lifetime risk is 37% among people aged 55 years and over in the UK. An established risk factor for stroke, it is also associated with an increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline. While guidance from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recommends oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention among certain groups with atrial fibrillation, the effect of anticoagulant choice on the incidence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment is not well-understood. In particular, whether dementia risk is affected by drug class (vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin versus direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban), timing of prescriptions e.g. in relation to stroke and any interaction with patient demographic or clinical characteristics is not well-understood. This is important to inform prescribing policy.

In this cohort study, we will use routinely collected primary and secondary care data to investigate the effect of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants prescribed to older individuals with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation on rates of incident dementia and mild cognitive impairment. We will use multivariable Cox regression models to adjust for potential confounding factors, and assess (for vitamin K antagonists) whether effects vary by time in the therapeutic range. We will also undertake a range of sensitivity analyses. These include (1) expanding our outcome definition to include a broader range of causes of dementia, (2) restricting to individuals with linked primary and secondary care data only to improve ascertainment of atrial fibrillation and outcomes, and (3) restricting to individuals diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in primary care to improve accuracy of data on the timing on first anticoagulant prescription. We will carry out similar analyses in a population of stroke survivors to investigate the effect of prior atrial fibrillation and anticoagulant choice on the incidence of post-stroke dementia.","Primary

Epidemiology of hydroxychloroquine prescriptions in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink,"New guidance has recently been published on how patients who take the medicine hydroxychloroquine should be screened to prevent eye problems. Hydroxychloroquine can cause damage to the back of the eye (retina). Although this problem is rare, if it is not spotted early and the medicine stopped, it can cause blindness. The new guidance recommends specialist tests done in hospital eye clinics. This had not been recommended before. In order to follow the guidance, a lot more tests and appointments than previously will be needed in hospital eye clinics but there has been no previous estimate of how many more.
We will use the records of prescriptions from the CPRD to find out how many people are taking hydroxychloroquine. We will use this number to estimate the number of people in the UK who are taking hydroxychloroquine.  We will also use the records of prescriptions to find out how long people continue to take hydroxychloroquine, and use this to work out many additional hospital eye clinic tests and appointments are needed.
This study will provide information for planning hospital eye services which is much needed by the commissioners of healthcare in the UK.","Background: The Royal College of Ophthalmologists published new guidance in February 2018 on screening for people taking hydroxychloroquine. The new guidance recommends specialist tests undertaken in hospital eye clinics; whereas previous guidance did not. Eye tests are recommended at baseline, 5 years after treatment initiation and annually thereafter. The guideline was published without providing an estimate of the number of people it will affect, and the effect on already over-stretched eye services.
Aims: We aim to estimate the number of people in the UK currently receiving hydroxychloroquine for any indication, and the length of time they continue to take this for, and to use this to provide estimates of the number of additional eye clinic appointments implementing the guideline will require.
Methods: We will identify all people in CPRD Gold who have ever been prescribed hydroxychloroquine. We will estimate the contemporary point prevalence of current hydroxychloroquine using the number currently taking either drug as the numerator and the whole CPRD population as the denominator. We will apply these estimates to the population of the UK to estimate the number of people in the UK currently taking hydroxychloroquine.
We will use prescription data to estimate the length of time each person continues to take hydroxychloroquine. We will use Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the proportion of people continuing to take hydroxychloroquine at time-points annually 1-20 years after drug initiation. We will use this data to estimate the number of people in the UK requiring hospital eye tests.
Impact: This study will provide information which commissioners of hospital eye services in the UK need to plan how best to implement the recommendations of the guideline.","1) The number of people in the CPRD taking hydroxychloroquine.

Although drooling may be encountered in healthy children, but beyond the age of 3 years is considered abnormal. Uncontrolled sialorrhoea can have negative consequences on health and quality of life. 
Since the 1990s, glycopyrronium has been used for the management of sialorrhoea (drooling) in children with impaired central nervous system, such as cerebral palsy, due to its interfering action on saliva production. However, the effectiveness of glycopyrronium bromide should be balanced against the adverse effects associated with treatment.
The Marketing Authorization applicant has been asked by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to provide additional safety information on prescribing of glycopyrronium bromide as part of the licensing application for the management of severe sialorrhoea (chronic pathological drooling) in children aged 3-17 years. 
This study will use the information from the CPRD to investigate the safety profile of oral glycopyrronium bromide in children aged between 3-17 years.","In the context of the glycopyrronium Bromide (1mg/5mL) oral solution marketing authorization application, the MHRA recommended additional information to support safety profile of drug in children. In response to this, the Company (Ennogen Healthcare Ltd.) will conduct a retrospective observational study using CPRD data.
This descriptive study will help the applicant to show that glycopyrronium bromide is a safe medicine for treating severe drooling of saliva in children and adolescents (aged 3-17 years) with conditions affecting the nervous system, such as cerebral palsy and neurogenerative disease.
The study aims to analyse the CPRD data and understand the safety profile of oral glycopyrronium bromide in children aged 3-17 years. The study will mainly focus on any adverse drug events related to drug interactions, anticholinergic, cardiovascular, central nervous system, hepatic and renal effects of oral glycopyrronium bromide. 
A descriptive, exploratory statistical analysis will be used to analyse the data, and is generally limited to frequency and incidence rates. The Applicant will consider the correlation and relatedness between glycopyrronium bromide exposure and adverse events. Adverse events frequency and incidence rates will be calculated for each adverse event from the total number of patients who have been exposed to oral glycopyrronium bromide. The frequency of most common adverse events per SOC will be calculated and will be presented in tabular format and graphs. Similarly, severe adverse events and drug-drug interactions relevant for glycopyrronium in general will also be considered. This study will support benefit and risk of the product in regards to its risk and other common and rare adverse events that may have occurred with exposure with glycopyrronium bromide. This will also help healthcare professionals in adequately managing and monitoring of patients in respect to dosing and in further treatment.","- To understand the safety profile of glycopyrronium bromide in children aged 3-17 years.

Patients with T2DM can control their blood sugar with effective treatment and usually start receiving a single drug. However, if patients are unable to control their blood sugar levels and their average blood sugar measurement (referred to as HbA1c) goes above a certain level (7.5% [58mmol/mol]), then patients may be offered a second drug and national treatment guidelines recommend drugs belonging to one of three drug classes:

 - Sulphonylureas (SU's); 
 - Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i); 
 - Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) 

These medications have similar effects in clinical trials, but their effect in the real-world is less well understood. Additionally, while treatment guidelines recommend a second drug be given to patients that are unable to control their blood sugar levels below (7.5% [58mmol/mol]), it is not clear when this occurs in clinical practice 

This study aims  to evaluate whether the impact of adding a second drug to a patient's treatment regimen in clinical practice varies according to the patient's HbA1c level at the start of treatment. In addition, the study will evaluate the impact of each class of drug on patients' blood sugar levels and outcomes such as changes in body weight, stopping rates and diabetes-related complications. A better understanding of how patients' blood sugar levels at the start of a new treatment regimen may lead to better management of patients with T2DM and improved patient outcomes.","Patient-level data will be extracted from CRPD to retrospectively analyse a cohort of T2DM patients (>/=18 years of age) who were prescribed both metformin and one of three medications between 01-01-2002 and 31-12-2017:

Shingles mostly affects people as they get older and particularly over the age of 70. Zostavax is licensed for those aged 50 and above and is offered free of charge to 70 year olds with vaccination available for those aged 79 to 71 who haven't been vaccinated yet. Shingles vaccines have been used in several countries, including the US and Canada. Previous studies have found that Zostavax is safe and well-tolerated. There have been a few cases of Bell's Palsy (a type of facial paralysis) and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (a neurological disorder causing weakness, numbness and pain of the feet, hands and limbs) reported following exposure to the vaccine via the Yellow Card Scheme to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK. However, both events occur naturally in the target population and so this study in the CPRD is designed to investigate if there is any association between Herpes Zoster vaccination and an increased risk of these two events. A self-controlled case series design will be used to analyse patients having received a diagnosis of one of these conditions and Herpes Zoster vaccination and compare their risk in exposed and non-exposed time windows.

1616634177-2542,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=8,Safety of five years of pertussis vaccination in pregnancy in England: a cohort study,"Whooping cough ('pertussis') can cause serious illness, particularly in young babies. Since October 2012, pregnant women in the UK have been offered pertussis vaccine. This was introduced in response to an increase in cases of whooping cough, which particularly affected babies under 3 months old. Vaccination in pregnancy aims to protect infants against whooping cough, from vaccine antibody transferral from mother to the unborn child.

Pertussis vaccination for pregnant women is a recent change, and it is important to monitor the safety of this new programme. Safety studies globally have included nearly 150 000 vaccinated women in total. The results have been reassuring and consistent, however, some questions remain which we will look at in this study. First we will assess whether there may be a small increased risk of infection of the fluid in the womb ('chorioamnionitis') or bleeding after birth ('postpartum haemorrhage'), next we will look at safety using longer term follow-up of babies for birth defects, and finally we will look at any effects of changes to the vaccine brand and recommended stage of pregnancy that the vaccine is given.

To do this study we will compare pregnant women who were vaccinated to pregnant women who were not vaccinated. We will look at death of the mother, stillbirth or death of a baby soon after birth, premature birth, chorioamnionitis, postpartum haemorrhage and major birth defects. This study will inform vaccine safety monitoring by Public Health England and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.","Pertussis vaccination in pregnancy was introduced in the UK in October 2012, in response to a national outbreak with the highest incidence, hospitalisation and death in infants under 3 months old. A recent systematic review identified 16 international safety studies, including 150 000 women. Results are generally reassuring, but there are research gaps. Some (but not all) previous studies found a signal for an association of vaccination with postpartum haemorrhage and with chorioamnionitis (but not its expected consequence of preterm delivery) and length of follow up has been insufficient for ascertainment of congenital malformations diagnosed after birth.

Using a cohort study design, this study will examine whether there is any association between vaccination in pregnancy and adverse maternal, foetal or infant outcomes which are severe (stillbirth, maternal death, neonatal death) or for which specific research gaps have been identified (chorioamnionitis, preterm delivery, postpartum haemorrhage, major congenital malformations) during the first 5 years of the programme. The LSHTM/CPRD Pregnancy Register will be used to identify pregnant women eligible for vaccination. 

The main analysis will compare adverse outcomes among women vaccinated in pregnancy to concurrent eligible but unvaccinated pregnant controls. Multivariable Cox regression models will be used to adjust for confounding by gestational age for analyses of stillbirth, maternal death, preterm delivery, and to adjust for length of follow up for analysis of congenital malformations. Multivariable logistic regression models will be used for analyses of neonatal mortality, postpartum haemorrhage and chorioamnionitis. A secondary analysis will examine whether the two different vaccines used during the programme, or vaccination earlier in pregnancy are associated with adverse outcomes. A sensitivity analysis will compare rates of stillbirth, maternal death and neonatal death among women vaccinated in pregnancy to historical controls (matched on maternal age and gestation) using conditional Poisson regression, to update an earlier MHRA analysis.","Primary: Stillbirth; maternal death; neonatal death

Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the proportion of diagnosed vs undiagnosed. We will then use logistic regression models to identify factors associated with no diagnosis of COPD.

In the UK, guidelines recommend that blood pressure drugs are prescribed to patients based on a combination of their blood pressure and their overall cardiovascular risk (which takes into account factors like smoking, diabetes and age and predicts how likely somebody is to have a heart attack or stroke in the next ten years).  However, some studies show that doctors don't agree with using risk and might just use high blood pressure to decide on treatment.  

Our previous study showed that using only cardiovascular risk to decide on a patient's treatment would prevent more heart attacks and strokes than the current UK guidelines.  This would mean treating people with high risk, even if their blood pressure was normal, and would rely on doctors understanding and using risk to make treatment decisions.  At the moment, it is not clear to what extent blood pressure, risk, or both are influencing use of blood pressure lowering drugs. 

Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether or not drugs are prescribed when a patient first has high blood pressure, and which factors (blood pressure, risk, age, sex, or other patient factors) mean that a patient is more likely to receive drug treatment.  We will also investigate whether these factors are related to control of blood pressure. 

The results of this study will help us to make future recommendations and provide support for GPs to use guidelines in their everyday practice.","Randomised trials have shown that blood pressure lowering treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. For primary prevention, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends using a combination of blood pressure and risk to determine eligibility for blood pressure lowering treatment.  However, there is some evidence that GPs and patients do not understand, agree with, or use measures of absolute risk in their decision making, and continue to use 'hypertension' alone as an indication for treatment, irrespective of their risk.  We have previously shown that an entirely risk-based approach to blood pressure lowering would be at least as efficient and would prevent more cardiovascular disease events than the current and newly proposed NICE guidance.  However, if an entirely risk-based strategy is to be implemented, then it will rely on GPs using risk in their decision making for treatment.  

Therefore, this study aims to investigate current patterns of prescribing of blood pressure lowering treatment among patients with incident hypertension, and which patient-level factors are most strongly related to incident prescription of blood pressure lowering treatment.  Furthermore, given the increasing importance of blood pressure control among patients with increasing cardiovascular disease risk, we will determine which patient-level factors are most strongly related to subsequent control of blood pressure.

We will conduct a cohort study in CPRD, identifying patients with incident hypertension between 2013 and 2017.  The outcome will be a new prescription of blood pressure lowering drugs on the date of diagnosis.  We will describe drug use by QRISK2 scores, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and other patient-level characteristics including age, sex, diabetes, polypharmacy, and comorbidity.  We will use logistic regression modelling to investigate the determinants of prescribing, and the determinants of control at six months and one year.

The results of this study will guide future recommendations and help to provide support for GPs to translate any new guidelines into clinical practice.","Objectives 1-3: Prescription of blood pressure treatment on date of hypertension diagnosis

Though these 2 diseases are vaccine preventable diseases, re-emergence and recurrent outbreaks are reported worldwide. Vaccine reluctance and/or non-compliance to recommended vaccination schedules are the primary reasons for these resurgences. However, it cannot be excluded that the genetic diversity of circulating measles and mumps strains may affect the effectiveness of the available measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines.

In 1988, routine immunisation against measles and mumps was introduced in the UK as part of a combined MMR vaccine. Both MMR-II (MSD) and Priorix (GSK) vaccines are available in the UK market with MMR-II vaccine being the most in use. The UK recommended MMR vaccination following a schedule with a first dose between 12 and 15 months of age and a second dose at 30 months of age.

Limited data on the effectiveness of Priorix has been reported to date. Therefore, this study will aim to assess the effectiveness of Priorix against the 2 highly contagious diseases, measles and mumps, in children born after 2004 in the UK.","The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Priorix vaccine against measles and mumps diseases in children born after 2004. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) will be evaluated for at least 1 dose (primary objective) and for 1 dose and 2 doses (secondary objectives) of Priorix. VE against measles and mumps diseases will be assessed separately on 2 distinct study populations.

The study will be an observational, retrospective, matched case-control study with a targeted case-control ratio of 1:4. All children born after 2004 and with first diagnosis of measles or mumps disease between January 2006 and December 2018 will be included in the study as cases. Cases will be identified from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) databases by using disease specific medical codes (CPRD medical codes and International classification of diseases [ICD]-10 codes according to the source data). The index date will be the date of the diagnosis of the first reported event. Control subjects will be matched by month and year of birth and practice region. Exposure to Priorix will be identified by using the batch number variable available in the CPRD database.

A conditional logistic regression will be applied to compute odds ratio. The model will be adjusted for index for multiple deprivation (IMD) and number of consultations during the year prior to index date as covariates. VE will be calculated using the following formula:

This study aims to estimate the trends in diabetes-related complications and cause of death in patients with diabetes in England 1998-2017 and compare with the non-diabetes population.

Study design
This study uses a historical open cohort study to develop an analytic, dynamic cohort to examine age-specific incidence and mortality rates and compare between the diabetes and non-diabetes population. We will estimate the trends in diabetes related complications and cause of death in patients with diabetes over a 20-year period and then compare incidence and mortality rates and rate ratios with the non-diabetes population. 

The exposure of interest is diabetes (both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) and key outcomes of interest are diabetes-related complications, including microvascular and macrovascular disease, cancer and dementia and cause-specific mortality, including microvascular and macrovascular disease, cancer, dementia, chronic lower respiratory disease, chronic liver disease, respiratory failure including due to pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, intentional self-harm and accidents.

The primary cohort is those with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) in each of the 20-years in the study to identify diabetes-related complications and cause of death during follow up. We will additionally have a non-diabetes cohort to provide comparison (rate ratios) with the diabetes population.
 
The primary analytic method will be discrete Poisson regression with year, age at follow up and event status (for diabetes-related complication, not for mortality) as time dependent variables. Key outcome measures will include incidence rate, mortality rate, and rate ratios comparing the diabetes and non-diabetes populations.","Incidence of diabetes-related complications

Managing diabetes therefore places a significant burden on the NHS, which is expected to rise over time. We aim in this study to estimate the financial cost to the English NHS of treating and caring for people with diabetes over the five years from 2015 to 2019. Using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), we will count and cost the use of GP surgery services, prescriptions, outpatient attendances and inpatient stays and compare these between patients with type 1 and type 2 and no diabetes, between males and females, and between ten-year age bands. This will provide valuable information about the effects of diabetes and different patient characteristics on healthcare burden and help to inform the planning of future services.","The aim of this study is to characterise the primary and secondary healthcare costs of treating people with diabetes. 
Patients in CPRD whose data are eligible for linkage to HES and have a recorded Read or ICD-10 code indicative of diabetes mellitus and/or a prescription for a glucose-lowering therapy and no diagnosis indicative of secondary diabetes will be selected. People will be classified as having type 1 and type 2 diabetes using a previously published algorithm1 based on the diagnostic code recorded, prescribed glucose-lowering therapy, age at onset and body mass index (BMI). NHS resource use (primary care consultations, prescriptions, outpatient appointments and inpatient admissions) and associated costs will be characterised across five years (2015 to 2019), chosen to coincide with the most up-to-date linked secondary care data. The linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) inpatient and outpatient data will be used to categorise inpatient admissions and outpatient appointments and to provide the information needed to cost these resources using standard NHS costing methods. Healthcare costs will be stratified by sex and 10-year age band and compared between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and the general population without diabetes. Healthcare resource use and costs will also be compared between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and their matched controls with no diabetes. We predict that costs will not have a normal distribution, in which case a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare costs between those with diabetes and the general population.",Healthcare resource use and associated healthcare costs.,"Miss Bethan Jones - Chief Investigator - Pharmatelligence

Some interventional and observational studies have suggested a relationship between osteoporosis and risk of heart attacks and stroke in elderly people. This is suggested for patients under treatment for osteoporosis or those who have had an osteoporotic fracture. However, no previous study has assessed this relationship in a real-world setting. Meanwhile, there are several risk assessment tools for both cardiovascular diseases and osteoporotic fractures. We aim in this study to investigate the potential relationship between these diseases. 

For this study we will include all female patients registered in the CPRD database between 2006 and 2019 who had a fracture when they were aged 50 years or more. Two well-known models developed in British populations will be used in this study to calculate patients' risk of having a bone fracture or heart attack/stroke. These models will use the clinical characteristics and medical diagnoses of patients in the 12-month period before the fracture, and the distribution of heart attack/stroke and fracture risk in different patient populations will be presented for further exploration.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: To explore and visualise the distribution of risk of cardiovascular diseases and osteoporotic fractures in a female post-fracture population.

METHODS/DESIGN: This will be a cross-sectional study. Women registered in CPRD for at least 12 months during the study period will be included if they have an incident fracture while they are aged 50 years or more. Two established clinical risk prediction tools (QRisk for cardiovascular diseases and QFracture for osteoporotic fractures) will be applied at the date of the incident fracture to all patients based on the demographic and clinical data in the 12-month period before fracture date. Risk distribution for diseases in total population and various sub-populations will be presented visually for exploration.

IMPORTANCE: The results of the study will help in hypothesis generation regarding the potential risk relationships between cardiovascular diseases and osteoporotic fractures. Given the potential hazardous effects of some anti-osteoporotic treatments on cardiovascular diseases, identification of patients at high risk of fracture but low risk of cardiovascular diseases is important for targeting with new medications.","Predicted risk of cardiovascular diseases and osteoporotic fractures, using two established clinical risk prediction tools, in a large population of patients with incident fractures.","Dr Alireza Moayyeri - Chief Investigator - UCB Pharma SA - UK

1616634112-2514,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=9,Investigating capacity for NICE guidance on recognition and referral for suspected cancer,"In this study, we will examine how many people in England qualify for testing for possible undiagnosed cancer. The testing is guided by recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and sometimes means going to a hospital. These tests are good at finding cancers in the brain, lungs, in the gut, and in the urinary or reproductive systems. 
In the past, these tests were only carried out when a doctor thought there was quite a high chance that a person had cancer. But nowadays more people are sent for testing, because of worries that cancers were being caught too late. The greater number of tests has put pressure on the hospital departments where the tests are done. The Department of Health needs to have a good idea of the number of people who qualify for testing, so that they can plan their services well enough to make sure that everyone can be seen quickly. 
In our study, we will look at the medical records of around two hundred thousand ordinary people in England. We will work out how many of them should be sent for these cancer tests. We will use our results to work out how many people in England overall qualify for testing for cancer. We will compare this with the number of urgent two-week-wait appointments currently being done, to get an idea of the size of unmet need. This will help future planning of services. We will also find out how many of these people are later diagnosed with cancer, to check how well the NICE recommendations for cancer investigation are working.","In this study, we will provide a robust estimate of the likely numbers of people in England presenting in primary care who are eligible for investigation because they have symptoms of possible cancer. Eligibility is guided by the NICE 2015 Suspected Cancer Recognition and Referral Guidelines (NG12).  The number of two-week-wait referrals for suspected cancer is increasing year on year, with no sign of levelling out.  Direct investigation for possible cancers is also increasing relentlessly. An estimate of the likely maximum number of annual appointments and direct investigations would help to improve capacity and workforce projection planning by the Department of Health, both for existing and future planned services. 
We will study a representative sample of 200,000 adults aged 40 or over who are registered with general practices in England in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We will use existing lists of medical codes to estimate how many patients have symptoms, signs or abnormal blood test results (from hereon called ""cancer features"") that warrant referral or direct investigation according to the NICE NG12 guidelines. We will then use publicly available population data from the Office for National Statistics to estimate the total number of adults aged 40 and over in England who are eligible for referral or investigations. We will also use publicly available data from Public Health England to estimate the current numbers of urgent two-week-wait appointments, to quantify unmet need.
As a secondary analysis, we will examine the one-year incidence of cancer in people eligible for cancer investigation (equivalent to the positive predictive value for each NICE recommendation). This is important to help with any future revision of NICE guidance, particularly with the recent Government suggestion that the 3% risk threshold warranting urgent investigation for cancer should be lowered.","Primary outcomes: The proportions of patients in England eligible for any of the following investigations for suspected cancer:
 - An urgent two-week-wait referral; 
 - A direct GP request for any of the following investigations: 
  a. chest X-ray;
  b. ultrasound;
  c. computed tomography (CT) scan;
  d. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head; or
  e. endoscopy.

It is called pre-diabetes when people have higher than normal sugar levels but not yet achieve diabetes levels, It is believed that the risk of other chronic diseases is accumulating from the pre-diabetes status. In recent decades, researchers also found that diabetes may increase the risk of many types of cancer, for example pancreatic cancer. But for now, there is no cancer screening programme for people with diabetes or pre-diabetes. Therefore, we will examine whether there are more cancer cases from pre-diabetes. It will help find out the best time window to start help people with pre-diabetes or diabetes screen cancer. In addition, we will also examine if cancer diagnosis changes by age, sex and ethnicity to help specific groups.","Using data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with linkage to Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) and Office of National Statistics (ONS) Death Registration, we will investigate the trends in cancer incidence and mortality in people with pre-diabetes and diabetes to identify possible cancer screening window. Participants with a first ever HbA1c measure between 6.0%-6.4% or a diagnosis of pre-diabetes and no prescriptions of glucose-lowering drugs and diagnosis codes of any types of diabetes will be extracted as pre-diabetes groups. They will be followed-up from the date of confirmed pre-diabetes to outcomes of interest occurred, the diagnosis of diabetes, death, transfer-out the practice, last data collection date, whichever came first. Participants with a first ever diagnosis code of diabetes will be extracted as the diabetes group, and they will be followed-up from the diagnosis of diabetes to outcomes of interest occurred, death, the latest available of HES linkage, whichever came first. Age-Period-Cohort (APC) analysis discerns three types of time varying phenomena: Age effects, period effects and cohort effects. In our study, APC analysis incorporated with Lexis Diagram Observations will be applied to quantitatively assess the effect of age, calendar year and durations of (pre-)diabetes on the cancer. Trends in cancer incidence and mortality, by all-sites and site-specific, will be modelled with Poisson Regression, rates in people with pre-diabetes and diabetes will be presented by age, durations and calendar year. These will help to identify the time window to implement cancer screening among people diagnosed with diabetes, site-specific cancers as outcomes will provide information on which types of cancer should be screened. Given the high risk of diabetes and diabetes-related complications in South Asians and differences in cancer outcomes by gender, these analyses will be stratified by White and South Asians, and by male and female, to demonstrate the potential inequities among ethnicities and sex.","1.

Most people who are diagnosed with COPD are current or ex-smokers aged over 40 years old. The number of people who get COPD differs between counties across the world, even between European countries. For example, approximately 7.5% of people in France were diagnosed with COPD in 2008 whereas only 4% of people were diagnosed with COPD in the UK. Similarly, differences between how frequent COPD patients are admitted for hospital or the proportion who die from COPD exist between the UK and France. Comparing people with COPD between France and the UK and the use of healthcare resources surrounding their disease will help researchers understand differences in COPD management and practice patterns and how this could be improved in order to improve quality of life in people with COPD.","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms and persistent airflow limitation, due to cigarette smoking in the vast majority of cases. In patients of 40 years old or more, the prevalence of spirometry-confirmed COPD has been estimated at 7.5% in France in 2008, while there are approximately 4% of people diagnosed with COPD in the UK - 60% to 85% of people with COPD, mainly with mild-to-moderate disease, remain undiagnosed. Epidemiological studies report a gradual increase in the prevalence in most countries. In 2030, it is estimated that COPD could be the third leading cause of death worldwide. An average of 18,000 deaths per year have been recorded in France over the period 2000-2011, while approximately 30,000 people in the UK die of COPD annually.

The treatment of rectal cancer most commonly involves radiotherapy to the rectum, followed by surgery. After the rectum is surgically removed, the large intestine (colon) from above is connected to the lower portion of the remaining rectum, or the anus, to maintain normal transit of stool from below. While this operation avoids a permanent bag at the skin level, many patients experience bothersome bowel symptoms as a consequence of losing their rectum (e.g., ""going"" often, not emptying their bowels fully, accidental leakage of liquid and gas). Additionally, some individuals may notice changes in their urination and sex life as a consequence of pelvic surgery and radiotherapy. The objectives of this study are to determine the frequency of bowel, urinary, and sexual symptoms after surgery for rectal cancer, and to understand factors associated with their development. We will use a large hospital-admissions database (HES) to identify patients relevant to our study, and a large primary-care database (CPRD) to identify bowel, urinary, and sexual symptoms. We will use advanced statistical methods to understand factors most associated with each set of symptoms.","The most common operation performed for rectal cancer is a restorative proctectomy. While this operation avoids a permanent ostomy, many patients (~70%) are left with significant bowel dysfunction (e.g., frequency, urgency, and incontinence) that impairs their quality of life. Furthermore, patients may experience urinary and sexual dysfunction, both of which can be consequences of pelvic surgery and radiotherapy. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the incidence of bowel dysfunction after rectal cancer surgery, and to identify factors associated with its development. Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of postoperative sexual and urinary symptoms, as well as to evaluate the association between bowel dysfunction and new-onset postoperative sexual and urinary symptoms. This will be a large cohort study making use of two linked databases. Cohort inclusion criteria will be based on relevant rectal surgery procedures codes in the HES database, and outcomes will be defined using symptom read-codes and medication prescription product-codes recorded in CPRD.

Polypharmacy (the prescribing of multiple medications) is increasingly common and patients are now routinely prescribed medication long term for the management of chronic conditions (e.g. thyroxine in under active thyroid disease). In the UK, General Practitioners usually coordinate the prescribing of patients' medications.

Previous studies have reported that poor coordination of transitions of care may lead to medication errors and potentially adverse drug events. In particular, it is known that discharge communications following hospitalisation commonly omit appropriate medications unintentionally.

It is not clear how these transitions of care and potential for unintentional omissions impacts on prescribing in the GP record. The aim of this study is to examine the GP and hospitalisation records of older patients prescribed specific medications long term and determine the impact of hospitalisation on their continuity in the GP record.","Background:
Previous studies have reported an increased risk of medication discontinuity post hospitalisation. These studies have primarily examined large dispensing and/or administrative databases post hospitalisation to record the outcome of 'discontinuity'. There has been limited specialised study of the impact of hospitalisation and/or medication error at hospital discharge propagating forward into general practice prescribing records.

To determine whether the unintended discontinuation of specific common, evidence based, long-term medication occurs after hospitalisation; what factors are associated with unintended discontinuation.

General practices receive payments based on their performance against a list of clinical indicators included in the QOF. For example, there is a clinical indicator assessing the proportion of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) whose blood pressure is controlled within the recommended limits. 

The QOF was first introduced in 2004 and has undergone a number of changes over time. Each year the scheme is reviewed and the list of indicators included in the programme changes. In 2014 approximately one third of the clinical indicators were retired from the QOF, meaning that financial incentives were no longer provided for performance against those indicators. It is important to understand what happens to the quality of care provided to patients when general practices are no longer incentivised to deliver these activities.

Previous studies have examined the direct effect of removing these indicators on the patients or activities targeted. However, the wider consequences for other patient groups or activities have not been considered. We will use CPRD data to examine whether the removal of financial incentives from the QOF had wider impacts on the quality of care for patient groups and activities not directly targeted by this removal. These wider effects could be positive or negative. It is important to understand the full impact of the changes to determine the overall impact on care quality for patients.","The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) links financial incentives to the quality of care provided by general practices. Practices are rewarded for their performance against a list of indicators. The QOF underwent a major revision in 2014, when 40 of the 121 indicators were removed. It is important to understand what happens to the quality of care provided to patients when general practices are no longer incentivised to deliver these activities.

Previous studies have examined the direct effect of removing these indicators on the patients or activities targeted. However, the wider consequences for other patient groups or activities have not been considered. For example, doctors may now divert their efforts away from patients or activities that no longer attract financial incentives towards patients and activities that are still linked to incentives. We will use CPRD to examine whether the removal of financial incentives from the QOF resulted in wider 'spillover' effects beyond the patient groups and activities directly targeted by this removal. We will use programme evaluation techniques (including interrupted time series) to test for wider spillover effects onto a) patients not targeted by the incentive removal, and b) activities not targeted by the incentive removal.","We will examine the following tasks which have been incentivised for two or more QOF conditions:

Mapping and prediction study,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) describes a number of conditions including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It affects over a million people in the UK alone, reduces quality of life and costs the NHS a lot to treat. It can be hard to diagnose, but little is known about how patients get their diagnosis, for instance whether when seeing their GP, following various tests or during an emergency admission to hospital. We need to understand how long it takes to get diagnosed and what can cause delays.

A common consequence of COPD is that breathing can quickly get much harder (known as an acute exacerbation, AECOPD), causing lung damage. If we can predict which patients are the most likely to go on and have an AECOPD, then treatment and monitoring can be adjusted. Previous attempts to do this prediction have failed for various reasons, but with our data and statistical approach we can overcome those problems.

Our aims are:
1. To map out patients' ""routes to diagnosis"": whether in hospital during their first AECOPD or by their GP, and whether their other medical conditions affect how and how quickly they get their diagnosis
2. To see how all this differs depending on where people live in England and whether things have changed since ten years ago
3. To see who is most at risk of an AECOPD and how the risk changes with time since diagnosis, paying particular attention to patients who also have conditions that have similar symptoms","Aims and objectives: To describe and model the patient journey from symptom presentation to diagnosis and first acute exacerbation for COPD patients in England. This will include examining variations by Clinical Commissioning Group, GP practice and time period, followed by the construction and validation of a risk prediction or risk trajectory model for the first AECOPD.

Methods: Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and two cohorts ten years apart, we will describe the management of the patient following initial presentation with symptoms through to their diagnosis of COPD and their first AECOPD, which for some patients will be the same event. Given that COPD can present differently depending on comorbidity, the mapping will be described separately for people with asthma and heart failure in particular. The second part will model the risk of the first AECOPD using factors such as airways obstruction, age, smoking, BMI, gender, comorbidities and public data on temperature and pollution. This will use logistic regression, random forests and cause-specific hazards modelling. Predictors will be ranked in importance from GP, patient and system perspectives. Models will be externally validated using CPRD ""Aurum"" practices.

Anticipated impact and dissemination: This study will fill key gaps in our understanding of how patients obtain their COPD diagnosis (their ""route to diagnosis""), how they are managed in primary care, and how they get their first AECOPD. Comparisons between the two time periods will highlight what has changed and inform NHS preparation for future needs regarding COPD. A risk prediction model for first acute exacerbation will aid shared decision-making between GPs and patients and facilitate early intervention; ranking the predictors will suggest priorities for action.",#NAME?,"Professor Alex Bottle - Chief Investigator - Imperial College London

1616634130-2522,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=9,Treatment cut-offs for blood pressure lowering and lipid lowering treatment: a cohort study in UK primary care,"In the UK, blood pressure guidelines recommend use of blood pressure drugs for all patients with blood pressures of 160/100mmHg and above. However, the reason that this cut off has been chosen is unclear, since there is no sudden increase in the risk of heart attacks and strokes above this level.  Treating high blood pressure also reduces the risk of damage to organs including the kidney, heart, eye and brain, but it is unclear at which level of blood pressure the risk of this damage increases.

Similarly, UK guidelines for lipid lowering drugs (statins) recommend referral to specialist doctors when cholesterol levels reach a certain cut-off (9mmol/litre for total cholesterol). The reason for this choice of cut-off is unclear.

Crucially, among thousands of people in the UK, these cut-offs determine whether or not people receive drugs and additional care that could reduce their risk of heart attacks and strokes.  Making decisions about which patients to treat should be guided by evidence.

Therefore this study investigates whether there are cut-offs, for either blood pressure or cholesterol, above which treatment would be more beneficial.  We will use data from UK primary care, and group patients according to their level of blood pressure, cholesterol, and their predicted risk of disease.  We will then see which patients go on to have heart attacks, strokes and damage to their kidney, heart, eye and brain.  By comparing groups, we will be able to see which groups would benefit most from treatment.","In the UK, blood pressure guidelines recommend use of blood pressure lowering drugs for patients with blood pressures of 160/100mmHg and above, irrespective of their absolute cardiovascular disease risk. However, there is little evidence to justify this cut-off because the relationship between blood pressure and CVD events is log linear.  

Similarly, NICE guidelines for lipid lowering drugs (statins) recommend specialist investigation when total cholesterol is 9mmol/L, or non-HDL cholesterol is above 7.5mmol/L, irrespective of absolute cardiovascular disease risk.  As with blood pressure, the evidence base for these cut-offs is unclear.

Crucially, among thousands of people in the UK, the blood pressure cut-off determines eligibility for drugs that can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by 20%, and cholesterol cut-offs determine whether further health care is provided.  Making decisions about which patients to treat should be guided by evidence.

Therefore this study aims to determine whether there are levels of either blood pressure or cholesterol above which treatment is justified.  Using data from UK primary care, we will generate a cohort of patients without cardiovascular disease, and stratify them by their predicted absolute cardiovascular disease risk, blood pressure and cholesterol at cohort entry.  We will follow them up and observe the rate of cardiovascular disease and target organ damage in each stratum.  This will provide evidence about whether there should be cut offs at which treatment or further investigation are warranted, irrespective of risk.","Cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure)

1616634110-2513,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=9,Stroke incidence among people with heart failure and atrial fibrillation,"Heart failure (HF) is a condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to satisfy the body's demands, causing symptoms such as breathlessness and tiredness. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) describes a type of irregular heartbeat. 
HF and AF are common conditions and many people have both, including around 1 in 200 adults in the United Kingdom (UK). Having just one increases the chances of a stroke up to five-fold; having both makes the stroke risk higher still. 
Blood thinning medications are recommended for people with HF and AF and can prevent around two thirds of strokes. However, a third of people with AF who could take these medications are currently not prescribed them.
We will report how many people with AF and HF have a stroke, related death, or a serious bleeding episode, which is the main side-effect of the blood thinning treatment. We also want to see how many people receive the recommended medication and which groups of people don't. To do so, we will analyse anonymous patient records held within The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a database containing the general practice records of millions of people in the UK. 
We hope that by identifying the groups at risk of not receiving blood thinning medication, we can help target future improvements in healthcare. We will use this data for further research looking at different approaches to organising stroke prevention treatment, to see if we can recommend affordable changes to delivering care that help more people get the recommended treatment.","Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are common conditions that often co-exist - around 0.5% of the UK adult population have both. Each is independently associated with an increased stroke risk. In combination, the risk is higher still, but there is considerable variation between previous estimates of effect. Anticoagulation is recommended for patients with HF and AF and can reduce stroke risk by 65%. However, in AF, anticoagulation is not prescribed in one third of eligible patients. 

The aim of this study is to determine the stroke incidence, mortality and rate of major haemorrhage for patients with HF and AF, compared to either condition alone or neither condition. We will compare current rates of anticoagulation against national guidelines within these groups and identify factors associated with low rates of anticoagulation prescribing. 

We will conduct a retrospective cohort study using CPRD data from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2018, using a time-dependent analysis to account for the fact people will change between groups over follow-up. Incident cases will be recorded at entry to the study cohort and with each subsequent new diagnosis of either AF or HF. Data will be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics to validate diagnostic codes and Office for National Statistics for mortality data.  

A survival time analysis will describe stroke incidence over time in each of the four groups (HF, AF, HF+AF, no HF/AF) alongside cumulative incidence plots of survival rates. Multivariable Cox regression modelling will assess the association between HF, AF and time to stroke based on key variables, adjusting for anticoagulation, co-morbidities and the individual components of the CHA2DS2VASc stroke risk score. 

The data collected will be used to inform a health economic analysis, using Markov modelling to predict the comparative clinical and cost effectiveness of future alternative treatment strategies to improve anticoagulation.","The primary outcome measure: 

-	Incidence of stroke, including type of stroke classified as either ischaemic or haemorrhagic (including either subdural, extradural or other e.g. subarachnoid).
 
The secondary outcomes measures include:

-	All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, including mortality rates related to HF, AF or stroke. 
-	Incidence and type of major haemorrhage, including either intracerebral or gastrointestinal
-	Incidence of transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
-	Proportion of eligible patients prescribed anticoagulation, the type of anticoagulation used, (i.e. whether a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)) and the factors associated with high and low rates of anticoagulation prescribing.

GPs record no definite reason for the antibiotic prescription in about half of all antibiotic prescriptions. Our previous reserach used the CPRD Gold database.

As type 2 diabetes is largely managed in primary care, the recording of ethnicity in primary care Electronic Health Records is vital in identifying ethnic patterning of the overall number of people affected and of the number of new cases of type 2 diabetes and its management, and outcomes. Across the UK National Health Service, ethnicity is typically grouped into the 6 main categories of the UK Census: white, south Asian, black African/Caribbean, mixed, other or unknown. Previous work in the CPRD has identified that approximately 30% of all individuals with type 2 diabetes have unknown (missing) ethnicity. When trying to assess ethnic differences in diabetes management, it is possible that such missingness may bias the results. The aim of this project is to characterise the unknown ethnic group, i.e. how the measured variables differ/are similar between ethnic groups. In practice this will be pursued by using classification and prediction of ethnic groups based on baseline variables such as blood measurements, demographics, and comorbidities. Determining if/ which variables influence the classification/prediction of unknown ethnicity will be crucial in informing the decisions about how to deal with unknown ethnicity when trying to answer substantive questions about ethnic differences in diabetes management in the future.","The aim of this project is to investigate how to characterise patients of different ethnic groups, including unknown ethnicity using multivariate statistical methods like principal component and cluster analyses on different sets of baseline variables such as biomarkers, demographics, comorbidities, separately and combined Such multivariate techniques will allow us to explore whether and which set of variables allows us to identify groupings corresponding to the different ethnic groups. Subsequently discriminant analyses techniques will be applied depending on the results of the clustering, with the aim of predicting ethnicity/missing ethnicity. Such techniques can be parametric (e.g. linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression) and non-parametric  (e.g. classification trees, random forests). Considerations about the assumptions required and interpretative issues will lead us to use either type of techniques and/or compare the performances of different prediction techniques. Which variables contribute to the classification of missing vs non-missing will also be an important question we will be addressing by these multivariate techniques. 
The impact of using general practice level information as a proxy for patient level information (for example using the deprivation score of the general practice postcode instead of the patient's home postcode), will also be assessed when using such variables for clustering and classification.
 This work will help us assess how to deal with missing ethnicity and will inform decisions about the use of imputation methods for unknown ethnic group in future causal analyses on the effect of ethnicity in particular and provide an insight on the impact of coarser measurement of the exposure.",Ethnicity,"Dr Luigi Palla - Chief Investigator - London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM )

1616634134-2524,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=9,"Utilization, safety and effectiveness of pharmacological therapy in gestational diabetes","Gestational diabetes (a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy) is a common pregnancy complication. It can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes to mother and child, including potential long-lasting health impacts (e.g., heart disease and type 2 diabetes). Proper control of blood sugar during pregnancy is crucial in preventing these long-term complications. 

Drugs are usually given for women who do not achieve target blood sugar levels through lifestyle interventions such as diet or exercise. Although insulin is the recommended treatment for pregnant women with gestational diabetes, it is inconvenient for patients because it is administered by injection and because it requires increased medical visits for monitoring. Oral anti-diabetic drugs, such as metformin or glyburide may be potential alternative treatments. However, there are safety concerns surrounding their use during pregnancy that require further investigation. Currently, there is no clear consensus on the effectiveness and safety of using metformin or glyburide during pregnancy due to limitations of existing studies in this area. 

Therefore, we aim to use information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to provide complementary evidence to current clinical trials with rigorous research methods. We will include all pregnant women in the CPRD between 1998 and 2018 with a gestational diabetes diagnosis. We will first describe the utilization of drugs used to treat gestational diabetes in terms of trends over time and patient characteristics. We will then investigate the effectiveness and safety of these oral anti-diabetic drugs vs. insulin on short-term and long-term health outcomes of mothers and their offspring.","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as glucose intolerance during pregnancy, has detrimental impacts on short and long-term health outcomes of mothers and offspring. Insulin is a first-line treatment for GDM not controlled through diet that creates patient burden with more medical visits and administration via injection. Oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs), such as metformin or glyburide, may be viable alternatives to insulin, but placental drug permeation presents safety concerns requiring further investigation. There is no clear consensus on the effectiveness and safety of OHAs due to the limitations of the evidence, including small sample trials, different diagnostic criteria, and few long-term follow-up studies. Although OHA use has not been authorized during pregnancy, it is recommended in guidelines and frequently used off-label. It is crucial to quantify real-world use and to evaluate effectiveness and safety of OHAs versus insulin with large samples and appropriate methods. 

Thus, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of GDM treatment in a populated-based cohort of women with GDM. We will (1) describe the utilization, patient demographic and clinical characteristics of GDM treatments; (2) examine the effectiveness and safety of GDM treatments on short-term outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, birth weight) and long-term outcomes (e.g. GDM recurrence). Using CPRD pregnancy registry, CPRD Gold, the mother-baby linkage, and Hospital Episode Statistics, our study will include all pregnancies from women with GDM and no prior history of diabetes identified from 1998 to March 2018. We will first describe the prescription patterns of different GDM treatments by year and maternal demographics and comorbidities. Binomial regression will estimate the risk difference and risk ratios of binary outcomes comparing use of metformin versus glyburide and metformin versus insulin. Marginal structural Cox models will be applied for time to event outcomes accounting for time-varying confounders by weighting by high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS).","Our outcomes of interest include maternal and perinatal outcomes (preterm birth, birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), large for gestational age (LGA), macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycaemia, birth injury, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, glycemic control, preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational weight gain), in addition to offspring-related long-term outcomes (height, weight, body mass index (BMI), metabolic abnormality, neurodevelopment disorders (NDD), and maternal long-term outcomes (recurrence of GDM, incident type 2 diabetes)).","Dr Samy Suissa - Chief Investigator - McGill University

1616634132-2523,https://www.cprd.com/protocol-list?page=9,The effect of smoking on BMI amongst COPD patients compared with controls: a retrospective cohort study using the CPRD GOLD database,"In the general population, cigarette smoking leads to loss of weight while quitting smoking often results in gaining it back. This may ameliorate some of the health benefits of quitting in these people. On the contrary, in certain patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gaining weight is associated with a more positive outcome. However, it is unclear how cigarette smoking behaviour relates to changes in weight in people with COPD. Weight change may be related to the effects of smoking or to the disease itself (or both). 

Smoking may have a different relationship to a change in body-mass index (BMI) in patients with and without COPD. One previous study showed that weight changes were similar in patients with lung disease and smokers with normal lung function, indicating that it is smoking that mainly affects weight. However, this study included people with a narrow age range (70-79) and they had better overall health than typically found in ""real world"" settings.  Importantly, they did not consider whether COPD patients smoked or not. Another study also did not examine smoking behaviour in COPD patients but found that changes in fat-free mass and fat mass were small and comparable between COPD patients, and smoking and non-smoking patients without COPD.

Therefore, in a ""real world"" setting, we aim to determine the relationship between smoking and BMI change. The knowledge that smoking affects not only the aetiology of COPD but also BMI may be important for patients and physicians when determining treatment options and prognosis.","The main objective of this study is to assess the change in body-mass index (BMI) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and non-COPD (i.e. controls) cohorts by current, former, and never smoking status measured in a time-varying manner. 

One well-conducted study investigated this topic but had poor generalisability and was underpowered to examine the effect of smoking status among COPD patients. Another study also could not examine the effect of smoking status in COPD patients and had only 3-years of follow-up. Neither study examined BMI, which is a measure of body composition that is more accessible in primary care settings. Importantly, none of the previous studies assessed smoking in a time-varying manner. A time-dependent analysis of smoking on BMI will account for changes in smoking behaviour over time, which has not been explored previously.

A cohort of patients aged >/=40 years with a recorded Read code (in CPRD) for COPD during the period of valid data collection (from 1 January 2005 to present) and a second cohort of controls without a COPD Read code will be followed from their index date until the date of death, date of transfer out of the practice, the end of data collection, or outcome of interest, whichever comes first. Both cohorts will be grouped into current smoking, former smoking, and never smoking groups over 90-day periods in order to examine the effect of smoking status - measured time-dependently - on clinically relevant change in BMI.","Time-to-first event of a greater than or equal to a clinically relevant 5% decrease or 5% increase in BMI from baseline are the primary outcomes of interest. A 5% increase and a 5% decrease in BMI will be separate outcomes with separate hazard ratios (HR) in each of the study cohorts (i.e. four estimates total). Patients with a change in BMI <5%, and patients without a second BMI measurement will be censored at the earliest of the date of death, date of transfer out of the practice, and the end of data collection.","Professor Frank de Vries - Chief Investigator - Utrecht University

These drugs are very commonly prescribed; proton pump inhibitors in particular are one of the most commonly used medications worldwide. While typically indicated for short-term use, some evidence suggests that they are increasingly being used for longer periods, often times in individuals without underlying disease or for longer durations than necessary. As a result, there have been efforts to implement programs to decrease the use of proton pump inhibitors, though the effectiveness of such programs is unknown. This is against a backdrop of safety concerns with proton pump inhibitors, with recent evidence suggesting that chronic use may be associated with a number of safety concerns. Finally, it remains possible that the use of proton pump inhibitors in the United Kingdom has been underestimated by previous studies, as these drugs have been available for purchase over the counter in pharmacies since 2004, but this impact has not been studied. Given the pervasiveness of acid suppressant drugs, understanding their patterns of use over time and the impact of existing deprescribing programs is an important concern. Thus, we will conduct a drug utilization study to examine the prescribing patterns of these drugs over time. We will also investigate their intensity of use, persistence patterns, and the impact of over the counter drug availability. Studies of this nature may inform future programs which target medication overuse.","Proton pump inhibitors and histaimine-2 receptor antagonists are acid suppressant drugs used by millions of individuals across the United Kingdom to manage the symptoms of several gastric diseases. In recent years, the use of PPIs has been steadily increasing, with over 50 million PPI prescriptions dispensed in 2015 in England alone. As a result of this dramatic increase, and given the risks associated with PPI use, the National Institute for Clinical Evidence recommended deprescribing PPIs in primary care as of 2014. Deprescribing can be described as dose de-escalation, or yearly treatment reassessment. However, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of this recommendation, and whether or not this has influenced prescribing practices of general practitioners. It is also unknown whether the over the counter availability of proton pump inhibitors has influenced their prescribing rates among general practitioners. Thus, we will conduct a drug utilization study to examine the existing gaps in knowledge in the utilization of acid suppressant drugs in the United Kingdom. Specifically, we will examine yearly prescribing incidence rates for both classes of acid suppressant drugs and examine patterns of use among certain subgroups (stratified by age, sex, indication and country). We will also examine persistence patterns to determine the impact of the latest deprescribing guidelines published by the National Institute for Clinical Evidence. Finally, we will conduct an interrupted time series analysis to determine whether the over the counter availability has influenced prescribing rates of general practitioners. Overall, this study will examine how acid suppressant drugs are being used in clinical practice and may help determine if new deprescribing initiatives are necessary.",The outcomes of interest for this study are rates of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) prescriptions over time.

The likely course of development of cardiorenal conditions is very important. This has a substantial impact on the choice of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes and the intensity of blood sugar control measures required to achieve optimum levels. In a time of emerging treatment options for type 2 diabetes that may offer benefits but also pose risks based on the precise combination of heart and kidney conditions, there is an increasing need to understand the interactions between diabetes and these combinations of diseases in clinical practice. Work to date include associations between type 2 diabetes and mainly diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels, otherwise known as cardiovascular diseases. However, this does not take into account kidney disease as an established risk factor for complications, including how disease progression pathways may increase risks of cardiorenal disease, death and impact health care resource use in these patients. Therefore, to provide answers to these specific questions, this study will use administrative healthcare records to describe populations of patients with unique combinations and patterns of appearance of cardiorenal diseases over time in order to establish their association with adverse clinical outcomes and death.","It is increasingly being recognised there are commonalities between cardiovascular, renal and metabolic (CaReMe) diseases with clinical overlap between these diseases and their associated complications.1, 2 Although these relationships between disorders are increasingly being elucidated there is often under-recognition by health care professionals and patients and this contributes to patients being managed for conditions in isolation.3 These relationships are increasingly important as therapies develop that could address multiple aspects of disease outcomes and may be used across this spectrum of disorders. Using a cohort of prevalent T2D patients, we will examine the incidence of cardiorenal diseases, their patterns of appearance over time, and subsequent association with adverse clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular (CV) and all-cause mortality. This study will utilise the CPRD Aurum database and the study period will begin on 1 April 2007 and will end on 31 March 2019. Each of the clinical outcomes of interest will be described separately. Event rates and 95% CIs will be reported as both incidence risks and incidence rates. Survival distributions utilising Kaplan-Meir method will describe time to cardiorenal disease progression, time to CV- and all-cause mortality. Relative risks and risk factors associated with outcomes will be estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. In addition, we aim to further highlight the impact of comorbidities on health care resource utilisation. Using a cohort of incident T2D patients, we will examine the care pathways of the patients to describe health resource use including GP consultations, laboratory tests or measurements, medication, referrals to specialist and hospital admissions.

This group of drugs includes thiazide diuretics, which have been shown to be effective in reducing blood pressure. Recently, however, there have been some concerns that the use of thiazide diuretics may increase the risk of some cancers, including colorectal cancer. Thus, to address this concern, we will conduct a large study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to examine whether the use of thiazide diuretics is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Because colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, results from this population-based study will provide important information on the long-term safety of these drugs.","Antihypertensive drugs are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide, with thiazide diuretics accounting for nearly 30% of these prescriptions. Recently, there have been controversies regarding the long-term safety of thiazide diuretics. Observational studies have reported associations with certain cancers, including colorectal cancer. To date, however, this possible association has been understudied and warrants further investigation. This is particularly important given that colorectal cancer has the third highest incidence among all cancers. To address this question, we will assemble a cohort of approximately 300,000 patients newly treated with either thiazides or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors between April 1, 1998 and December 31, 2017, with follow-up until December 31, 2018. Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of colorectal cancer comparing thiazides with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors using inverse-probability of treatment and censoring. Secondary analyses will assess whether the risk of colorectal cancer varies by duration of use, cumulative dose, and by individual agents. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to specifically assess the association between thiazide diuretics and the incidence of colorectal cancer.","We identify all incident colorectal cancer events occurring during the follow-up period recorded in either the CPRD or HES repository.

Among such medications are drugs for depression, bladder control problems, digestive tract problems, and many other conditions. Side effects of anticholinergic drugs may include dry mouth, difficulty urinating, and constipation, among others. Recent epidemiologic studies have raised concerns that long-term use of drugs with anticholinergic properties, particularly by older individuals, may promote the development of dementia. However, it is not clear if this is a true effect of the anticholinergic drugs or just a reflection of the fact that people taking these drugs may not be in good general health. The aim of this study will be to compare the risk of dementia between patients using drugs for the same indication where one of the drugs is anticholinergic and the other is not. Specifically, we will compare the risk of dementia between long-term users of paroxetine (an anticholinergic antidepressant) and other antidepressants that are not anticholinergic.","Anticholinergic drugs induce cognitive impairments, and accordingly their use has been discouraged in older patients. Beyond these acute effects, some observational studies have pointed to an association between chronic anticholinergic drug exposure and an increased risk of developing dementia. However, as the comparison groups for these studies have generally been non-users of anticholinergic drugs, confounding by indication remains a possible explanation for these associations. Accordingly, we will undertake a study to compare the risk of dementia with exposure to anticholinergic drugs for depression (amitriptyline and paroxetine) in comparison with drugs for depression that are not anticholinergic (fluoxetine and sertraline). We will conduct a time-to-event analysis for the outcome of a diagnosis of dementia with a Cox proportional hazards model, analysing cumulative duration of drug exposure as a time-varying covariate, and using propensity score methods to adjust for potential confounders.","- Alzheimer's disease
